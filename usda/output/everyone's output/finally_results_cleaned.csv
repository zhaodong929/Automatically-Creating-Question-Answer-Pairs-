"All Americans benefit from investments that provide consistent access to safe, healthy, affordable food, and COVID-19 revealed vulnerabilities in our food system. As we build back better, we must create new and better markets for all producers and consumers. The food system of the future needs to be fair, competitive, distributed, and resilient. The first step USDA took was to help producers get back on their feet through Pandemic Assistance. Now USDA is working to transform our Nation’s food system to create more options for producers and consumers and improve the resiliency of our food supply chain. The success of American agriculture hinges on research, innovation, and the development of new markets, both at home and abroad. Building a Resilient Food System USDA is helping build a food system that works better for everyone. The resource below provides a snapshot of more than 50 grant, loan, and technical assistance programs available to producers, rural development professionals, food businesses, grocers, schools, institutional purchasers, elected officials, anti-hunger organizations, and engaged citizens who are working together to build a more resilient food system for us all. Download English Handout (, 460 ) Descargar Folleto en Español (, 687 ) Transforming America’s Food System to Withstand Crises A strong and prosperous agricultural sector is essential to the well-being of the U.S. economy. America’s farmers and ranchers ensure a reliable food supply, support job growth, and promote economic development. By transforming the food system’s infrastructure and strengthening critical supply chains, USDA will ensure resilience against threats and disturbances and provide local and regional food systems with economic opportunities and security.  Learn more  USDA will build a more resilient food system by focusing on:  more resilient local and regional food production  fairer markets and options up and down the food system, from inputs through retail  ensuring access to safe, healthy, and nutritious food in all communities  building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate-smart food and forestry practices  making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and  committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America. Creating More Markets at Home In response to the increased demand for local and regional foods caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, USDA will prioritize investments that expand the middle of the supply chain and strengthen local and regional food systems and ensure food supply chain resilience for the future.  Learn more  Build Resilient Food Systems, Infrastructure, and Supply Chain  USDA works tirelessly to ensure that the food system is fair, resilient, competitive, and distributed. By transforming the food system’s infrastructure and strengthening critical supply chains, USDA will ensure resilience against threats and disturbances and provide local and regional food systems with economic opportunities and security.  Expanding the Middle of the Supply Chain  Concentration in the middle of the food supply chain has left both farmers and ranchers with limited options to process, aggregate, and distribute their products, and has left consumers with limited options to purchase food to support their local economy. USDA is investing in expanding the middle of the supply chain to provide more options for both producers and consumers, and to make the food system more resilient and less reliant on limited options.  Strengthening Local and Regional Food Systems  In response to the increased demand for local and regional foods caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, USDA will prioritize investments that strengthen these markets and ensure food supply chain resilience for the future. Investing in local and regional food systems will further enhance the share of profits for those who grow, harvest, process, and prepare our food.  Learn more  Foster Agricultural Innovation and Sustainable Products that Enhance and Create Markets  The future of U.S. agriculture, which includes plant and animal agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture, depends on continued science, innovation, and process improvements supporting technological progress, production efficiencies, and environmental stewardship. Advancing areas with a focus on climate-smart agriculture will enable the creation of innovations to minimize the environmental footprint of agriculture and ensure sustainability while improving crop yields. New technologies and system designs are needed to produce higher value end products from agricultural products, emerging crops, livestock, and forest feedstocks. This will enable new markets, establish new domestic supply chains, and create more jobs and economic opportunities. Increasing productivity has significant social and economic benefits for society.  Biobased Fuels and Products  Biobased fuels and products create new opportunities for creating sustainable options for existing markets and for new markets with products with enhanced attributes of performance and sustainability. USDA is supporting this commitment through the increased development, purchase, and use of biobased products through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, BioPreferred Program, and Wood Innovations Program.  Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities  USDA is committed to supporting a diverse set of farmers, ranchers, and forest owners through climate solutions that increase resilience, expand market opportunities, and strengthen rural America. The new Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities opportunity provides up to $1 billion for pilot projects that create market opportunities for commodities produced using climate-smart practices.

Submit a complaint  A Modern Set of Packers and Stockyards Rules  USDA is preparing new proposed rules under the Packers and Stockyards Act to address poultry contracting and tournaments, unfair practices and undue preferences, and the harm to competition burdens from the courts. In the meantime, USDA is committed to the enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act to the maximum extent possible under a new enforcement policy announced in August 2021.  Product of USA/Consumer Transparency  USDA is already hard at work clarifying the “Product of USA” label for beef. American consumers depend upon accurate, transparent labels to obtain important information about the food they consume. American farmers and ranchers depend upon those same labels to convey information about their products that consumers value and demand. USDA is working to conduct consumer testing and economic analysis to support a rulemaking on the voluntary “Product of USA” label.  Price Transparency and Fairness in Livestock Trading  USDA remains committed to enhancing the transparency, price discovery function, and the fairness of the livestock markets using traditional Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) tools. In August of 2021, AMS through its Market News service announced two new reports that enhanced transparency in cattle markets for cattle traded today through contractual arrangements outside of the cash negotiated spot markets. Enhancing Markets Abroad With 20 percent of U.S. agricultural production exported to the rest of the world, trade is a critical engine powering the rural economy. USDA is pursuing a worker-oriented, market-focused, rules-based trade agenda that removes unfair barriers to U.S. exports, restores America’s reputation for reliability, and leads to new and better market opportunities for producers and agribusinesses of all types and sizes.  Learn more  Expanding international marketing opportunities for U.S. farmers and exporters is critical to fostering business and income growth across rural America. It is essential for USDA to continue its efforts to promote American agricultural products and exports through promotion activities, development of international standards, removal of trade barriers by monitoring and enforcing existing trade agreements, and negotiation of trade agreements that benefit the U.S. agricultural economy. USDA will also work with developing countries to grow their economies and facilitate trade, developing markets of the future for all our producers.  American agriculture posted its highest-ever annual export totals in 2021, with $177 billion in global sales of food and farm products. Those exports boost producers’ bottom lines, stimulate local economic activity, and support more than one million American jobs—both on the farm and in related industries such as food processing and transportation.  Expand All Producers’ Access to Global Markets Through Negotiation and Enforcement of Trade Agreements  USDA partners with the U.S. agricultural industry to boost global demand for the high-quality, cost-competitive American food and farm products that customers around the world need and want. Our export market development programs continue to yield results, generating an estimated $24.50 in exports for every $1 invested by government and industry.  Learn more  In the trade policy arena, we work with other Federal agencies, foreign governments, international organizations, and U.S. stakeholders to create a global environment that’s conducive to agricultural trade by knocking down trade barriers, negotiating and enforcing trade agreements, and establishing transparent and predictable rules and standards.

"Climate Change Affects U.S. Agriculture and Rural Communities Climate change presents real threats to U.S. agricultural production, forest resources, and rural economies. Producers and land managers across the country are experiencing climate impacts on their operations through shifting weather patterns and increasingly frequent and severe storms, floods, drought, and wildfire.  Learn more  These threats have significant implications—not just for farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners—but also for surrounding communities and all Americans.  The Department is developing a comprehensive strategy centered on voluntary incentives that is inclusive for all agricultural producers, landowners, and communities, and that builds on the 90-Day Progress Report on Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry (, 561 ).  Additionally, USDA’s Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience outlines action items to address the most significant climate risks to agriculture, forestry, and rural communities.  The Fourth National Climate Assessment details how climate change is affecting various land uses in different regions of the United States. Agriculture Plays a Critical Role in Delivering Climate Change Solutions The American agriculture sector has an incredible potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon, and deliver lasting solutions to the climate crisis. America’s producers are already leading the way. In recent years, carbon stored in cultivated cropland soils increased by more than 8.8 million tons annually (, 1.9 MB) thanks to their voluntary conservation efforts. Farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners are ready, and USDA offers resources to help.  Learn more  USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service provides financial assistance and one-on-one technical support to assist producers in implementing climate-smart conservation practices such as no-till, cover crops, prescribed grazing, and silvopasture. This empowers producers to both strengthen their operation’s resilience to climate-related disaster events while leveraging their land’s potential to sequester and store carbon, thereby delivering lasting climate solutions.  A suite of resources for agricultural producers and conservation partners is available at farmers.gov/climate-smart. Producers may contact the NRCS office at their local USDA Service Center to learn more. Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity USDA is investing up to $2.8 billion in 70 selected projects under the first pool of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding opportunity, with projects from the second funding pool to be announced later this year. This effort will increase the competitive advantage of U.S. agriculture both domestically and internationally, build wealth that stays in rural communities, and support a diverse range of producers and operation types.  Learn more  On February 7, 2022, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would invest $1 billion in partnerships to expand market opportunities for climate-smart commodities and support America’s climate-smart farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners. Because of the unprecedented demand and interest in Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, and the potential for meaningful opportunities to benefit producers through the proposals, USDA has tripled this commitment to more than $3 billion. On September 14, 2022, Secretary Vilsack announced USDA is investing up to $2.8 billion in 70 selected projects under the first funding pool of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding opportunity, with projects from the second funding pool to be announced later this year.  Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities will finance pilot projects that create market opportunities for U.S. agricultural and forestry products that use climate-smart practices and include innovative, cost-effective ways to measure and verify greenhouse gas benefits. USDA is no longer accepting project applications for this funding opportunity.  This funding opportunity defines climate-smart commodities as being produced using agricultural (farming, ranching, or forestry) practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon. Funding will be provided to partners through the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation for pilot projects. Spanning up to five years, the 70 projects announced on September 14 will:  Provide technical and financial assistance to producers to implement climate-smart production practices on a voluntary basis on working lands;  Pilot innovative and cost-effective methods for quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas benefits; and  Develop markets and promote the resulting climate-smart commodities.  USDA anticipates that these 70 projects will result in:  Hundreds of expanded markets and revenue streams for producers and commodities across agriculture ranging from traditional corn to specialty crops.  More than 50 thousand farms reached, encompassing over 20-25 million acres of working land engaged in climate-smart production practices such as cover crops, no-till and nutrient management.  More than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestered over the lives of the projects. This is equivalent to removing more than 10 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year.  More than 50 universities, including multiple minority-serving institutions, engaged and helping advance projects, especially with outreach and monitoring, measurement, reporting and verification.  Proposals for the 70 selected projects include plans to match on average over 50% of the federal investment with nonfederal funds.

"What is nutrition security? Building on and complementing our long-standing efforts to address food security, we are expanding our efforts to advance food and nutrition security. Nutrition security means all Americans have consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being. Our approach to tackling food and nutrition insecurity aims to:  Recognize that structural inequities make it hard for many people to eat healthy and be physically active; and  Emphasize taking an equity lens to our efforts.  Learn more  A household is food secure if all members, at all times, can access enough food for an active, healthy life. At a minimum, food security includes:  Readily available nutritionally adequate and safe foods, and  The ability to acquire those foods in socially acceptable ways (without resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies).  Nutrition security means consistent access, availability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being, prevent disease, and, if needed, treat disease, particularly among racial/ethnic minority, lower income, and rural and remote populations including Tribal communities and Insular areas. Nutrition security is an emerging concept that complements efforts to increase food security while also:  Recognizing that Americans, in general, fall short of an active, healthy lifestyle aligned with Federal dietary and physical activity guidelines, and  Emphasizing equity to ensure our efforts serve all populations to promote access, availability, and affordability to foods and beverages, and address the connection between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases. View the Infographic (, 420 ) What is the problem? Poor nutrition is a leading cause of illness in the United States, associated with more than half a million deaths per year. It is linked with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease as well as broader impacts including higher health care costs and decreased productivity.  Learn more  Poor nutrition is widespread  Though poor nutrition affects every demographic, diet-related diseases hit harder among historically underserved communities.  The overall diet quality score for Americans is 59 out of 100, indicating that the average American diet does not align with Federal dietary recommendations. However, the resulting health burden is not equally shared. Certain populations are at greater risk for diet-related disease. For example, Black and Indigenous children are more likely to have obesity than their white peers. Those who face food insecurity are also at greater risk.  Beyond the effect on health, poor nutrition and diet-related diseases have far-reaching impacts including decreased academic achievement and increased financial stress. That translates to societal impacts as well—lower productivity, weakened military readiness, widening health disparities, and skyrocketing health care costs. For example, approximately 85 percent of current health care spending is related to management of diet-related chronic disease.  To make progress on these problems, Americans need equitable access to healthy foods that promote well-being. What is USDA doing? USDA wants input from all Americans on ways we can improve nutrition security. The department is particularly focused on strengthening and building new partnerships with all levels of government, the private sector, community-based organizations, and families. Together, we can make progress that will change lives and ensure a healthier, more prosperous future for all Americans.  Learn more  USDA’s work to advance nutrition security focuses on four pillars:  Meaningful Support  Healthy Food  Collaborative Action  Equitable Systems  Research and evaluation  USDA’s work on nutrition security is driven by research and grounded in science. In addition to the extensive research performed by the Food and Nutrition Service, the Agricultural Research Service has six human nutrition research centers, the Economic Research Service studies numerous topics central to food and nutrition security, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture advances food and nutrition security through research, education, extension, and innovation. Our work is also driven by the lived experiences – of our staff and our stakeholders.  Learn more about our nutrition security research.

"It's Time to Talk about the Birds and the Bees -- and the Butterflies, Bats and Beetles  Cross-posted from the Department of Interior blog: From birds and bees to butterflies, bats and beetles, pollinators are a diverse group and are critically important to terrestrial life on our planet. Without our help, however, their populations will continue to decline as a result of numerous stressors including loss of habitat, pests and pathogens, and exposure to pesticides. Bees and other pollinators are essential to America’s agricultural economy and maintain the beauty of our iconic landscapes. Without them, we wouldn’t have most of our vegetables, flowers, fruits or nuts. Honey-bee pollinations alone contribute more than $15 billion in value to U.S. agricultural production each year, but beekeepers reported losing just over 23 percent of honey bee colonies last winter. Other pollinators that help sustain food production and the environment—such as native bees and bats—also are declining.  Ann Mills, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and the Environment and Jon Jarvis, National Park Service Director  Posted in  Animals  Plants  Jun 16, 2015  Respond to this story","What is a major threat to pollinators such as bees, butterflies, bats, and beetles, according to beekeepers' reports?","According to beekeepers' reports, a major threat to pollinators is the loss of honey bee colonies, with just over 23% reported lost last winter."
"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 04, 2011  The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee. From the booklet, the southeastern blueberry bee (Habropoda laboriosa) visiting blossoms of a rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum). When I was a kid, there was one category for bees – “the stinging kind.” Fear of being stung wouldn’t allow me to consider variations among the swarms that patrolled playgrounds. The only thing that made bees tolerable was … the honey. Youthfully ignorant, I didn’t know that there are thousands of bee species (and some bee species are stingless) or that those bees on the playgrounds were more life saving than threatening. The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bees to educate the public and encourage people to help protect these essential insects. The 40-page booklet primarily focuses on bees native to North America, of which there are 4,000 species, found in forests, farms, cities, wildlands and deserts.  Although honey bees may be most noted for producing honey, the booklet explains that native bees are valued for pollinating plants. The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee. From the booklet, two female Morrison's bumble bees (Bombus morrisoni) sonicate the pollen from pored-anthers of a garden tomato.  “Much of the produce we eat is pollinated by bees,” said Larry Stritch, a USDA Forest Service National Botanist. “They pollinate about 75 percent of the fruits and vegetables grown in the (United States) and 80 percent of flowering plants. Take away bees and you greatly decrease our food source and food for animals.” According to “Bee Basics,” ground nesting bees provide food to wildlife and aerate and enrich soil.    The North American bumble bee, characterized by their relatively large, black, furry bodies and bright stripes, may be most familiar to Americans. There are about 50 species of bumble bees, which are important pollinators of tomatoes and clovers, a forage crop for cattle. Bumble bees are among the Apidae family of bees, which also include native carpenter, squash and cuckoo bees, and nonnative stingless, orchid and honey bees. Honey bees are the only natural source of honey that’s healthy for humans. Brought to America from Europe, honey bees don’t pollinate native plants as effectively as native bees. Along with information about a variety of bees, “Bee Basics” also contains pages of glossy, color illustrations of bees and plants. The booklet’s key message warns of the threat to native-bee survival that is posed by pesticides, competition for nectar from honey bees, and environmental destruction. To learn more about native bees, read “Bee Basics” on the Forest Service website.   The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee.

"District Wildlife Biologist, Region 5 Naturewatch Coordinator, Scott Salmon River Ranger District in  Forestry  Initiatives  Apr 23, 2010   In 1999, Yreka High School in Yreka, California received funds from a Forest Service Grant (Partners in Flight Program) to enhance their agriculture and natural resource program and provide wildlife habitat on school grounds. These funds were used to build a songbird garden, purchase fencing, materials for an irrigation system, and a greenhouse structure. The students and instructors constructed the fence, irrigation system and the greenhouse. The Songbird Garden Portion of the Yreka Community was funded by Partners in Flight Program. Then in the spring of 2009, the Siskiyou Gardens, Parks and Greenway Association (SGPGA) partnered with Yreka High School to develop a community garden and greenhouse. The Yreka Garden Club also agreed to help maintain the greenhouse in exchange for growing space. These organizations along with a number of community volunteers pulled their enthusiasm and resources together to make this project a reality. In a few short months they leveled the site, built the raised beds, fixed the fence and irrigation system, and started thousands of seedlings inside the greenhouse. Much of the heavy work was donated by members of the California Conservation Corps and some materials were donated by local businesses. The success of this community garden is the result of many enthusiastic volunteers. Approximately 25 beds were constructed as well as a flower beds to attract pollinators. The grand opening of this People’s Garden was May 3, 2009.  Festivities included a ribbon-cutting ceremony, old-time music, a plant sale, and gardening workshops. The garden was teeming with enthusiasm through the summer, and by September many hundreds of pounds of fruit and vegetables were ready to be harvested and donations were made to Yreka Senior Center, Yreka Hospice, Grange Hall Community Hot Meals Program, and Yreka Community Food Bank.  Through these organizations produce was made available to an estimated 300-350 people. Six workshops were held here on topics related to gardening, greenhouses, starting seed, and food preservation. This spring and summer the Yreka Community Garden will be hold free classes on permiculture, greenhouse plantings, composting and mulching, and canning. Special thanks goes to their partners! Members of the California Conservation Corps (CCC) volunteered their services for a variety of work including clean up, construction of the raised beds and setting fresh gravel in the greenhouse. The Ford Family Foundation Leadership Training Group is sponsoring the construction of an outdoor classroom/gazebo. This structure is a special project led by a local leadership training class which has been fund-raising for this project for 7 months.  This project has received much support from local contributors including Rotary Club and in kind contributions from local contractors. The Yreka Community Garden will also be developing a Children's Garden that will feature educational planting beds, small water fountain/bird bath, butterfly garden, willow tunnel, native American cedar plank house, and benches and paths. This is being developed by an active community group including U.S. Forest Service biologists, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, local teachers, child development specialists, and local gardeners.

"What is the Nine Agency Rule? The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) enforces the Nine Agency Rule under the authority delegated by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. § 2.25 (a)(1)(3). The Nine Agency Rule is designed to ensure that USDA programs of civil rights, including program delivery, compliance, and equal employment opportunity, adhere to all governing laws, rules, and regulations, including related Executive Orders and Congressional mandates. On February 14, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed Executive Order 14015, establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, emphasizing the importance of partnering with civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations, to serve people in need while adhering to all governing laws. This Executive Order revoked Executive Order 13831 and reinstated key provisions to protect religious liberty. Key Provisions of the Nine Agency Rule  Equal Access for Faith-Based Organizations  Under 7 CFR § 16, faith-based organizations are eligible to access and participate in USDA assistance programs on the same basis as any other organization. USDA and its intermediaries must not discriminate against or for an organization based on its religious character, motives, affiliation, or lack thereof.  Non-Discrimination Against Beneficiaries  Organizations receiving direct or indirect Federal financial assistance from USDA must not discriminate against current or prospective beneficiaries based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.  Separation of Religious Activities  Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance must separate any explicitly religious activities in time or location from the programs or services funded by USDA direct assistance, ensuring participation in such activities is voluntary. This restriction does not apply to indirect Federal financial assistance.  Notification Requirements  Recipients administering USDA social service programs must notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their right to be free from religious discrimination and how to report violations.  Alternative Providers  If a beneficiary objects to the religious character of a faith-based provider, the USDA awarding agency must make reasonable efforts to refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider.  Protections for Faith-Based Providers  Faith-based providers can compete equally with secular organizations for USDA awards while retaining their religious character, provided they comply with all applicable regulations. Examples of Nine Agency Rule Violations  Denied Service Based on Religious Beliefs  A food pantry volunteer denies service to an individual wearing a religious head covering and makes derogatory remarks about their faith.  Discriminatory Practices by Service Providers  A service provider receiving USDA funds denies services to a homeowner based on their perceived religion, using offensive language, and failing to address the discrimination. How to File a Complaint Any individual who believes they have been discriminated against based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice may file a complaint with OASCR.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication, and Larry Stritch, U.S. Forest Service National Botanist in  Forestry  May 03, 2012  Wildflower displays of blue Wasatch Penstemon and white Nuttall’s linanthus wildflowers bloom in the subalpine meadows of Albion Basin on the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest from mid-July through early August.  As spring begins across the nation, fields are turning green – and pastel pink, flaming scarlet, electric orange, brilliant yellow, deep violet and florescent blue.   Wildflowers are abloom!  This year, the Forest Service has released an updated wildflower map with 317 viewing areas to choose from on America’s national forests and grasslands.  In addition to locations, information is also provided on the best time for peak viewing. Yellow fritillaries are some of the first plants to bloom after the snow melts and are found in the western United States.  “Every year we continue to add new wildflower viewing areas,” said Larry Stritch, the U.S. Forest Service National Botanist.  “This year, we have updated the map so visitors can search by geographical region, state or national forest or grassland.  This makes it easier to plan day trips or extended journeys to enjoy the colorful displays of Mother Nature’s catalog of wildflowers.” Due to an extremely mild winter, an early spring is appearing in many areas and wildflower season has begun.  The pageantry begins with spring ephemerals such as bloodroot, Virginia bluebells, and squirrel corn.   Spring ephemerals are woodland wildflowers which appear in early spring, flower, set seed, and then die back to their underground parts before the trees unfurl their leaves. Other spring wildflowers seen in early spring include wild gingers, hepaticas, and trilliums. In late summer and early fall, the last wildflowers of the year begin to flower including asters, sunflowers, goldenrods, cardinal flower and gentians. Red columbine begin flowering in early spring in a cascade of blooms from the southern states on the Gulf of Mexico north into Canada.  The updated map includes a narrative for each viewing area which describes the area’s botanical habitat and wildflowers types that can be found by season, as well as recommendations for the best time of year to visit.  Safety advisories such as animal habitats, clothing recommendations, insect or plant cautions, and traffic and parking tips are provided.  Directions to the site, the closest town and contacts for more information are also offered. The map is part of the agency’s Celebrating Wildflowers web site which includes more than 10,000 plant images and over 1,500 pages of information about the aesthetic, recreational, biological, medicinal, and economic values of native plants as well how to conserve native plant habitats.

The Delmarva Fox Squirrel (DFS) is a subspecies of fox squirrel found on the eastern shore of Maryland, Southern Delaware and Virginia. This pudgy, slow squirrel with its signature size and silvery-white coat has become a conservation success story in Maryland. Habitat loss along with other additive factors landed them on the Federal endangered species list in 1967. Protection and management efforts benefited DFS and in 2015, populations reached stable limits and they were officially delisted in Maryland.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service-Florida Plant Materials Center in  Conservation  Animals  Plants  May 08, 2014  In northern Florida wildflowers are planted in an unused part of this farm field to provide habitat for pollinators. USDA photo. No matter what part of the country you grew up in, most of us have fond childhood memories of the wildflowers that sprung up each year around our homes, parks and roadsides. For many, this fondness has carried into our adult years. This week, we celebrate National Wildflower Week as a way to share our interest and to increase public awareness for wildflowers in the landscape. The beauty of wildflowers can indeed stir up memories of a certain place or time. But the wildflowers that are native to a particular place also serve an important function in the ecology of that place. Native wildflowers are those species that were already growing in an area before settlers came and planted their favorite flowers from their homelands. Plants that are native to an area are better adapted to the local growing conditions than non-native ones. They are generally easier to establish, require less water and fertilizer and are more tolerant of the pests and diseases found in that area. Many populations of native wildflowers have been lost because of urban development, competition from invasive plant species and some modern farming practices. We’ve learned that agriculture can benefit from native wildflowers. Patches of wildflowers located adjacent to crop fields can attract insects and other types of wildlife that in turn pollinate the crop and increase yields. In fact, more than a third of the world’s food crops are dependent on pollinators to produce fruit. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is working to combat this decline of wildflowers by promoting planting of them on farms and ranches. Several of the Farm Bill programs that NRCS administers have specific financial incentives tied to planting wildflowers. NRCS also maintains a national network of Plant Materials Centers that can provide information on which native wildflowers to plant to improve pollinator habitat and guidance on recommended methods for establishing and maintaining wildflower plantings. At the Plant Materials Center where I work, we recently partnered with the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation to track flowering periods of several native wildflowers. This information is being used to help develop seeding mixes for attracting pollinators to crops grown in Florida. Flowering periods of the crop and the wildflowers that we plan to use to attract pollinators must be in sync for successful pollination to occur. The information we gather can help determine the best wildflower species for farmers to plant in field borders, contour buffer strips and other conservation practices to ensure pollination of their crops.

"People’s Garden Intern in  Conservation  Initiatives  May 28, 2010   Today, the People’s Garden hosted a workshop about composting. Pat Millner, who has done a lot of research on composting and utilizing compost at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland, taught it. It was fantastically fun and informative, and Pat brought in several examples of composters for us to see. She informed us that composting isn’t as complicated as it might seem. Composts work because microorganisms break down the material, and these microorganisms need three things to be healthy, happy and produce lots of compost: food, air, and water. If compost contains these three principles, it will be fruitful. If you are looking to start a composter, the best season to start it is the fall. First, you need a bin. Layer about 4” of sticks (from any type of tree or shrub) in the bottom of the bin, this will provide good air flow and ventilation for the microorganisms and the compost. In your lawn, let your grass grow a little bit taller, and let the leaves fall too. Take your lawnmower and go over the area, catching the leaf/grass mix in a bag. You can put this mix in the bin, and let it take care of itself! What about those of us who live in a condo or apartment and don’t have a lawn, or just want a smaller compost? Try a vermicomposter. A vermicomposter uses worms to break down material into compost. You can “feed” the worms in the composter veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds and filters, crushed eggshells, shredded office paper, and even dryer lint. However, the worms aren’t fond of citrus fruits. Meat and dairy products should always stay out of composts too, the smell may attract some unwanted critters. The worms will consume what you feed them, and there’s no need to worry about them escaping. Their castings (a fancy way to say worm poop) make for very healthy compost! Before, when I heard about compost, the only use I knew was to enrich soil. Compost is used for much more! Runoff can create erosion and sweep away the healthy topsoil in many areas. A compost sock is a material that is filled with compost, and can be put on the side of a sloping hill, for example, to provide a filter for runoff rainwater. This can filter out any unwanted silt and even oil. Compost has also been added to places where chemicals or lead have contaminated the soil, causing plant life to die off; there, compost enriches the soil again and also blocks the harmful chemicals from being absorbed by the plants. If you’re looking for more information on composting, take a look at The People’s Garden Healthy Workshop handout on composting. It’s a great resource. Start a worm composter with newspaper or shredded office paper as bedding and about one pound of redworms.

"A Small Business Dream Built on a Farmers Market  My mom raised five kids, taught high school chemistry for 15 years and then retired back to the family farm in 1986. Her new life on the farm depended on the Salisbury, MD farmers market where she sold daylilies.  The farmers market, just one of 8,000 or more markets listed in USDA’s National Farmers Market Directory, gave her the opportunity she needed to start her own business. Each Saturday she loaded up her station wagon with plants and drove into town, displaying the lilies by color.  When she wanted to expand her plant offerings, my brother built her a small greenhouse.  She became known as the farmers market’s Flower Lady.

"Focusing on the Future of Food Assistance  USDA’s food assistance and development programs serve a dual purpose: to meet the immediate needs of hungry people, and to show their countries how to rejuvenate their agricultural sectors and increase their capacity to trade. We accomplish these goals in cooperation with other U.S. government agencies and with private-sector partners ranging from non-governmental organizations to research institutions to agribusinesses. And we are always looking for ways to be more effective. So this week, at the International Food Aid and Development Conference (IFADC) in Kansas City, we got back to basics, discussing steps we are taking to operate our international aid programs more efficiently to ensure that program dollars go directly to eliminating hunger and poverty. We focused on how USDA can strengthen our partnerships with academia and international relief and development groups, as well as with local and international companies. After all, these organizations have the know-how and expertise that allows USDA to leverage limited funding to make a broad and enduring impact.

"Director, Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center in  Forestry  Feb 10, 2012   When the first Europeans settled in what is now the United States, they found a continent of extensive wildlands. In less than 500 years, the undeveloped nature of these wildlands has been reduced significantly. As they became increasingly scarce and a fledgling conservation movement lost natural treasures like Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley to development, Americans began to appreciate their value. View of the Sawtooth Range in Idaho. U.S. Forest Service photo. With passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, a new course in history was chartered -- to preserve some of the country's last remaining wild places and protect their natural processes and values from development. The interagency Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center, located in Missoula, Mont., was created in 1993 to empower federal agency employees and the public to preserve their wilderness heritage through training, information and education. It has become a critical resource for land managers from the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service as they manage more than 109 million acres of designated wilderness from Alaska to Puerto Rico. The center’s staff of seven works with experts within and outside the agencies to develop comprehensive interagency solutions to critical stewardship issues. Materials are distributed electronically to each of the 792 units comprising America's National Wilderness Preservation System, and training is offered where it is most needed. Most recently, in collaboration with the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute and the Wilderness Institute at the University of Montana, the center conducted a webinar called The Foundation and Qualities of Wilderness Character. This interactive, collaborative approach to training and coaching ensures that the Carhart Center continues providing training and information that employees need, when they need it, so that they can keep wilderness wild.

"A Reflection: Celebrating Eight Years of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships  Looking back at USDA’s efforts to help rural America thrive, I am truly proud of the impact our diverse partners, both from faith and secular communities, have had within their communities. On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not. While our programs to reduce food insecurity are well known, our nation’s most vulnerable citizens can still be hard to reach. Faith-based and community partners have been especially helpful in this area, particularly when it comes to feeding children in summer months, when school is out of session. In collaboration with many partners, including Catholic Charities USA, the Church of God in Christ, Islamic Relief USA, the National Baptist Convention and the Salvation Army, USDA increased the number of summer meals served to kids by 16% between 2009 and 2015, a total of more than 1.2 billion summer meals served when school is out and food is scarce.

Winterport Water District has received a total of $1.89 million for essential upgrades to its infrastructure, including the replacement of over 6,000 feet of sewer line. The funds will ensure that partially treated sewage no longer flows into the Maine’s Penobscot River.

"Research in Energy Security Helps Lead to Food Security in West Africa  Research shows the majority of people in Africa depend on biomass to meet their energy needs, with approximately 80 percent relying on wood energy. Such high dependency makes families vulnerable to unexpected and sudden changes, including extreme weather and socio-political events. Researching and developing ways to diversify energy sources is crucial for a more sustainable, food secure future. A project funded through the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) Cochran Fellowship Program on “Biofuels for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods,” hosted by the University of Missouri (MU) College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources International Programs, set out to address this very issue. The research and training program was organized for West African Cochran Fellows to learn how different uses of biofuels can help support sustainable livelihoods in their communities.

Halfway around the world, a farmer in India stands proudly in the winner’s circle with his cow. Mr. S. Sukharpreet Singh Rode, the farmer, is a 2008 graduate of the Cochran Fellowship Program, an educational exchange program administered by USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). As a Cochran fellow, Mr. Rode spent two weeks at the University of Wisconsin learning about innovative techniques on animal husbandry, improved feeding practices, animal diseases and treatments, and calf rearing. With this background, Mr. Rode returned to India, where he used high-quality American dairy cattle genetics to improve his dairy business in the Punjab region, one of the most fertile areas in India. The cow in the winner’s circle with Mr. Rode is one of his American-origin Holstein crosses (crossed with a local Indian cow), and in February it won a milk production award at the Progressive Dairy Farmers Association show near Ludhiana. India is the world’s largest dairy producer and maintains the world’s largest dairy herd. Given population and income growth in India, Indian farmers are now looking for new management tools and technologies to increase local production and meet growing demand. U.S. cattle genetics are well adapted to Indian farming practices and are already providing significant milk yield increases for Indian farmers. Working closely with the FAS office in New Delhi, India, American genetics companies are helping India build its genetics technology. At the same time, the United States will benefit from a new market for American cattle genetics exports, which holds potential for significant growth. The FAS Cochran Program, which gave Mr. Rode the training he needed to improve his business, provides U.S.-based agricultural training opportunities for agriculture professionals like Mr. Rode from foreign countries. To be selected for the program, fellows must be senior or mid-level specialists and administrators from public and private sectors concerned with agricultural trade, agribusiness development, management, policy, and marketing. In the end, the Cochran Fellowship Program helps to support U.S. exports and build long-term relationships with trading partners.

It allows those facing high costs of water quality improvement to reduce those costs, working with farmers to improve water quality on their behalf, thus providing farmers with additional income streams and the opportunity to significantly increase the scope of conservation practices on their land.

"Ecologists Look to Traditional Knowledge to Bolster Sustainability Science  People around the world manipulate ecosystems for their own purposes. It’s what you leave behind when you’re finished working or living in the area that determines whether the ecosystem survives or is irreparably harmed for future generations.

"in  USDA Results  Initiatives  Energy  Food and Nutrition  Technology  Jan 26, 2011   Last night I had the privilege of attending President Obama’s State of the Union speech.  In it, he laid out some of the challenges America faces moving forward as we compete with nations across the globe to win the future. The President’s vision is simple.  We need to be a nation that makes, creates and innovates so that we can expand the middle class and ensure that we pass along to our children the types of freedoms, opportunities and experiences that we have enjoyed. At USDA, we share the Administration’s commitment to creating jobs and revitalizing our economy. We are driving innovation, promoting the production of renewable energy, which is creating jobs in rural America, helping our environment and decreasing our dependence on foreign oil.  We are helping provide a better education for America’s children, making the most important changes to school meals in decades so that our kids will be at their best and ready to learn in class.  We are building critical infrastructure, bringing access to high speed broadband internet to millions of rural Americans to help drive job creation and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth. USDA also shares the President’s belief that we need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government so that it’s leaner and smarter for the 21st century. Last year we saved $6 billion through the negotiation of a new agreement for crop insurance, $4 billion of which will go to pay down the federal deficit.  And agencies across the Department have looked for ways to reform the way they do business – from reducing the number of visits a farmer has to make to our offices to get conservation services, to saving millions in taxpayer dollars by operating our food assistance programs with historic levels of accuracy. And American agriculture has embraced these same values for years.  Our farmers and ranchers are problem solvers.  Time and time again, they’ve adapted, embracing science and new technology that have allowed them to produce about twice as much per acre as their grandfathers did 50 years ago.  Growers educate their children, build impressive operations.  And – particularly in recent years – they have carried very little debt relative to the rest of the economy.  These values are all part of why American agriculture has seen a strong and rapid rebound from the recession. Last night, the President told us that winning the future will require a lot of hard work and sacrifice from everyone.  But if our farmers and ranchers can do it – I know our nation can as well.  Working together, we can build a foundation for American competiveness for years to come so that we pass on a stronger America to our children and grandchildren.

"Conservation  Jun 22, 2010  On Friday, I was pleased to be part of unveiling the latest step in the Obama Administration’s strategy for restoring the Chesapeake Bay with the announcement of three Showcase Watershed projects in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. The Showcase Watershed pilot projects will demonstrate what can be accomplished by bringing people, sound science and funding together to solve natural resource problems in a targeted area. USDA and our partners are helping farmers within the Showcase Watersheds implement voluntary conservation practices to reduce nutrient and sediment runoff. This matters, because all of the water that enters waterways from local farms in the watersheds eventually ends up in the Bay. Successful approaches learned in Showcase areas can serve as models for restoring ecosystems elsewhere in the country. A thriving and sustainable agricultural sector is essential to the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, so the announcement of the Showcase Watersheds was made from a working farm in each State. I was honored to attend the launch event in Pennsylvania at the Eby-Patterson farm in Hershey, where the owners raise beef cattle and are excellent stewards of their natural resources.  We had the opportunity to examine the positive changes in the Conewago Creek that runs through their property.  With experts from our Natural Resources Conservation Service on hand we examined the aquatic life that is thriving in the creek and talked with the Patterson family about their efforts to contribute to a healthier watershed.All three watersheds—Smith Creek in Virginia, Upper Chester River in Maryland and Conewago Creek in Pennsylvania—include a wide diversity of agriculture, allowing for a number of different approaches to conservation. In every case, though, USDA is coordinating with numerous partners from local, state and federal government, non-profit organizations and private organizations to reach out to 100 percent of land owners. We rely on our nation’s working lands for sustenance, economic health and cultural heritage, not to mention beautiful and satisfying landscapes like the one I was privileged to visit on Friday.   The focused work we do in the Showcase Watersheds—added to the extensive conservation efforts already in place to restore the Bay—will strengthen both the region and U.S. agriculture overall, enhancing both productivity and sustainability. We are proud to be partners in this critical effort.  Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan looks over the creek at the farm of Mrs. Eby-Patterson and husband, Daniel.

"An Airport is No Place for an Owl  Seeing a short-eared owl in November on the Pittsburgh International Airport, where I work as an airport wildlife biologist, was a unique occasion. However, as the number of owls grew to eight, I recognized the challenge ahead:  Like all birds of prey, short-eared owls are a recognized potential aviation hazard. Their low rolling flight and difficult-to-disperse reputation means they pose an aviation safety threat.  From 1990-2012, short-eared owl strikes with aircraft in the United States caused over $1 million in damage, and often are fatal to the birds.  Convincing them to leave would be difficult but important. The task would be harder because short-eared owls are listed by the State as an endangered species.  Common in many areas globally, Pennsylvania is the southernmost edge of their breeding range.  These owls likely migrated from Canadian breeding grounds to winter in Pennsylvania.

On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not. While our programs to reduce food insecurity are well known, our nation’s most vulnerable citizens can still be hard to reach. Faith-based and community partners have been especially helpful in this area, particularly when it comes to feeding children in summer months, when school is out of session. In collaboration with many partners, including Catholic Charities USA, the Church of God in Christ, Islamic Relief USA, the National Baptist Convention and the Salvation Army, USDA increased the number of summer meals served to kids by 16% between 2009 and 2015, a total of more than 1.2 billion summer meals served when school is out and food is scarce.

"Undersecretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  May 17, 2016  School lunch staff and students enjoy the new school lunch menu created to meet the new standards at the Yorkshire Elementary School in Manassas, VA. It may seem like common sense for child nutrition programs to benefit children, but some see it differently today. Nationwide, schools have made the lunchroom a healthy environment. In fact, in only the second school year of full implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA), over 98 percent of schools participating are already meeting the healthier meal standards.  Students are eating more fruits and vegetables during the school day and more low-income children are eating nutritious breakfasts and lunches at school. And data show obesity rates for some children are leveling off. With all the success of HHFKA, now is not the time to intentionally go backwards on nutrition standards in healthier school meals and to block access to these meals for millions of children. In January, the Senate Agriculture Committee unanimously took a bipartisan step toward reauthorizing critical child nutrition programs like school lunch and breakfast. Rather than diminish the progress we’ve already made, the Senate's bill ensures these improvements to our children's diets will continue.  The bipartisan Senate bill represents a compromise that allows us to stop rehashing old debates and secures a healthier future for our kids. It represents a win for children, parents, schools, and our country's future. In contrast, the House Education and Workforce Committee’s bill aims to weaken one of the most successful aspects of HHFKA. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows high-poverty schools or districts to serve all students free meals without any burdensome paperwork, has been lauded for increasing student participation, reducing administrative burdens and costs on schools, cutting down on paperwork for busy parents, and improving program integrity. But the House bill would place new limitations on the number of schools in high-poverty areas that qualify for CEP, forcing many high-poverty schools to lose eligibility. This would cause school meal participation to fall dramatically, and schools would be forced to spend more time on paperwork and less time focusing on feeding kids. And some children who need free meals may slip through the cracks. The House bill would also roll back the school meal nutrition standards and gut the Smart Snacks in School rule, which ensures that all snack foods and beverages for sale to students during the school day are nutritious. Under the House bill, school vending machines could go back to selling soda and junk food.  Schools have already invested time and effort into making the switch to healthier options.  The snack food industry has innovated and developed hundreds of new products that meet the requirements and are popular with students.  Now is not the time to regress. We are proud of the way the school meals program provides flexibility for schools to tailor the programs to their local needs. For example, schools design their own menus and have the ability to serve items they know their students prefer.  They can also choose options like CEP and serve afterschool snacks and suppers if they are the right fit for their local community. However, in the name of local flexibility, some are considering a proposal to convert the school nutrition programs into a block grant. That is a very dangerous idea. Not only would it put further strain on state and local school districts’ budgets, but it would jeopardize children’s access to quality, healthy school meals no matter where they live. Instead, we are working with schools and districts to ensure their programs meet their needs. One example is the Team Up For School Nutrition Success training. Along with the Institute of Child Nutrition, we offer all state agencies the opportunity to host local events to provide tailored technical assistance, support, and best practices for schools in administering successful meals programs. During the training, schools cover topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics and strategies to reduce plate waste. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. With all these strides being made, now is not the time to eliminate the successful partnership between the federal government and state agencies, putting further strain on state and local school districts’ budgets. It would be unwise to roll back the school meal standards and I urge Congress to stay the course for sake of our children. USDA looks forward to working with Congress, schools, parents and communities to continue to improve the health and wellbeing of the next generation.

At USDA we’ve long recognized summer as a vulnerable time for kids and have been focused on closing the food security gap that occurs during the months when school is out of session.  Since 2009, more than 1.2 billion meals have been served through the Summer Meal Programs, fueling kids and teens throughout the summer and helping to ensure they are healthy and ready to learn when the school year begins. In support of these same goals, the White House announced earlier this year the Summer Opportunity Project, a multi-agency initiative to expand opportunities for young people through the summer.  The initiative aims to increase the participation of youth in evidence-based summer opportunity programs and make sure young Americans have the support they need to get their first job. USDA’s Summer Meal Programs play an important role in achieving this mission. By ensuring the most basic need of good nutrition is met, kids and teens in eligible communities can more easily pursue and leverage summer opportunities.  Many sites offer not only healthy meals and snacks, but also host physical and enrichment activities to keep kids engaged and coming back day after day.  By including free and low-cost activities into Summer Meal Programs, sites boost attendance and make the meal service more fun for children, their families, and volunteers.  To support these efforts, this spring USDA published Summer Food, Summer Moves to help sites and sponsors offer ideas on engaging kids, teens, and their families. Increasing the number of meals served through the Summer Meal Programs has been a rewarding achievement during my time at FNS, as each meal served elevates the life of a child or teen in our country.   With the help of our creative and hardworking volunteers, sponsors and partners, we were able to serve more than 190 million meals last summer.  Groups like Fuel Up to Play 60, Feeding America, Catholic Charities, United Way, and First Book have all played a key part in providing access to summer meals for children living in areas with high food insecurity.  Engaging the community in summer meals is also integral to the success of the program.  These programs allow communities to take a lead role in preventing hunger and focus their efforts where there is increased need.

"Forest Service Goal of Getting Kids Outdoors, Educating Young People Fits with Girl Scouts Legacy  In 1995, the Girl Scouts of the USA adopted “Linking Girls to the Land,” a program supported by the U.S. Forest Service and one that echoes the non-profit organization’s nearly decade-long legacy of helping to build girls of courage, confidence and character, and who make the world a better place. On Saturday, March 12, as they have all week during National Girl Scout Week, the organization will honor founder Juliette Gordon Low, who organized the nation’s first Girl Scout Troop with just 18 girls in Savannah, Ga., 99 years ago.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 30, 2016   Cross-posted from the Disability.gov blog: Your neighborhood grocer may be conveniently located just a few short blocks away. But for many persons with disabilities and the elderly participating in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the store might as well be on the other side of the world. It’s a difficult problem that USDA’s new homebound food delivery pilot aims to alleviate, not just for the more than 4 million nonelderly adults with disabilities participating in SNAP, but also for the nearly 5 million seniors, who often face similar challenges and who may face disabilities, as well. USDA recently announced the food purchasing and delivery firms selected to take part in the one-year pilot, which will be conducted in locations nationwide, perhaps at a location near you. Firms selected include Denver Food Rescue (Denver, Colo.), Lutheran Social Services of Nevada (Las Vegas, N.V.), Many Infinities, Inc. (Alabaster, Ala.), Senior Services of Alexandria (Alexandria, Va.), and Store to Door (Roseville, Minn.). The pilots break new ground for USDA. For the first time, governmental and non-profit food purchasing and delivery services will be allowed to accept SNAP benefits as payment. This is expected to increase the opportunities for home delivery to those unable to shop for food. I think it’s important to note that during the trial period participating firms will only be permitted to accept SNAP benefits from households where the qualifying person with disabilities or elderly person is the head of household. This is intended to ensure that the pilot focuses on households that have the most limited access to foods. Given that nearly one in five SNAP participants is either elderly or a person with disabilities, it’s clear that we must address the special challenges faced by these groups. Lessons we learn during the pilot will help USDA shape final rules now in development, which is an important step forward, as I see it. Home delivery of groceries will help ensure that those unable to shop for food themselves have access to the nutritious foods we all need to maintain a healthy diet.

Anne Arundel County Public Schools in Maryland understand this harsh reality and have taken steps to keep children fed during the summer months. This week Under Secretary for Food Safety, Elisabeth Hagen and I visited one of their schools, Maryland City Elementary in Laurel, to help announce their plan to offer free meals through USDA’s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) to all neighborhood kids, ages 2-18. What a fantastic way to alleviate hunger and strengthen the overall health of their community.  The SFSP is, designed to do just that, fill the nutrition gap during summer, by providing children free meals and snacks at registered feeding sites. Did you know that during the regular school year, at least 20 million children or more nationwide receive free and reduced-priced meals through the National School Lunch Program?  Yet little more than 3 million kids are fed in our summer programs -- not very good statistics. But we continue to work to increase those numbers.  This summer, Let’s Move! Faith and Communities (part of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative) is working with partners to host new feeding sites at congregations and neighborhood organizations.

USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. USDA is also funding numerous pilot projects in several states to test new ways to feed hungry children during summer. All of these efforts move us closer to our goal to end childhood hunger in this country – a goal I know we all can share and work towards together.  Summer months are critical; make no mistake, because hunger leaves children susceptible to illness and other health issues that make it harder for them to learn when school begins again. So we have to act now to ensure that our most vulnerable children are fed during summer so they too can grow up nutritionally healthy, academically strong, and best able to fulfill their dreams.   Healthy Students, Healthy Schools, Cultivating Communities of Wellness was the theme of the event at Maryland City Elementary. The county’s supervisor for Food and Nutrition Services, Jodi Risse, was instrumental in getting Maryland City Elementary and Hilltop Elementary in Glen Burnie to offer community feeding this summer.  Her hope this summer is to double the number of children served and she said it best, “to keep our kids fed, nourished and ready to learn when they come back to school next year.” Please follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter for the latest on ending hunger and nutrition assistance programs.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 25, 2011  Marla Emery works in the agency’s Research and Development’s People and Their Environments unit in Burlington, Vt. Marla Emery looks at plantain – an ordinary weed to most people – with an eye on how some people will use it. After all, her work with the U.S. Forest Service as a research geographer leads her to interesting conversations with people who forage in rural and urban forests. “On a good day, one of those people will take me out in the forest and we will walk around and pick up things that we can eat or use for medicine or use for something else,” she said. “They talk to me about how they see that forest and how they use that forest throughout the year. “A great deal of my work is done sitting in people’s kitchens talking to them. It is amazing. It’s truly wonderful. I never go into someone’s kitchen where they do not give me something to eat or drink while they are sharing all kinds of information with me.” Emery works in the agency’s Research and Development’s People and Their Environments unit in Burlington, Vt. She said her research has shown that no matter a person’s social or economic status, the connection to nature is the deep. “People are just passionate about their ability to go out into the forest or in the open spaces and interact immediately and directly with nature,” she said. “It creates deep, intimate relationships between people and places, people and ecosystems. Understanding those relationships tells us something important about how people and ecosystems interact.” Find out more about Emery and her research in Faces of the Forest, a bi-weekly feature of the U.S. Forest Service’s Office of Communication that showcases the people, places and professions in the agency.

"Under Secretary, Food Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 16, 2013   Making sure children have nutritious meals and keep their bodies moving all year long is one of USDA’s most important missions. Our Summer Food Service Program plays an important role in ensuring that all children get healthy meals during the summertime.    We’re proud to say that in 2012, our partners helped to serve 144 million summer meals at 38,800 sites across the country. That translates to 2.3 million children served on a typical summer day. But there is still a lot of work to be done. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of kids who rely on free and reduced price meals during the school year participate in the summer program. So this year we’ve set out to serve 5 million more summer meals. We need your help to meet that goal. On Friday, Secretary Vilsack held a roundtable with anti-hunger advocates from Share Our Strength, Hunger Free Colorado, and the state of Arkansas to encourage more organizations to work with us as sponsor sites. During the discussion, he reiterated how important it is for advocates and leaders in communities across the country to redouble their efforts to address the summer meals gap.  Click here to listen to the roundtable. After the discussion, we hosted a twitter chat through our account, @USDANutrition, to spread the word about summer meals and what we’re trying to accomplish. One of things I mentioned during the chat is that we want to increase participation by eligible kids in summer meals in every community that needs it, but we’re paying particular attention to states with great need like Arkansas, California, Colorado, Rhode Island and Virginia. As the Secretary said, poor nutrition during summer months can set up a cycle of poor performance once school starts up again in the fall. So what can you personally do to help?  There are many ways to be a part of preventing summer hunger. One of the best things you can do is help us increase the number of sponsors who provide free meals and activities to eligible low-income children. Churches, schools, government agencies, camps and other local organizations can act as sponsor sites.  Those sites also often need volunteers to lead fun activities or provide transportation. The best thing to do is visit our Summer Food Service Web page and start thinking about how you can best contribute. With strong support from individuals, communities and partners nationwide we can reach more disadvantaged kids with nutritious meals when school is out.

"FSA Windham County Executive Director in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 03, 2011   Last week, we welcomed Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan to Vermont as she toured farms to see recovery efforts after Tropical Storm Irene. Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan speaking with farmers at the Robb Family Farm near Brattleboro, VT. Our first stop was the Wheeler Farm, a 100 acre 50-cow grass based farm just north of Wilmington, one of the hardest hit communities in the state.  Visible water marks were higher than the historic flood of 1927 and hurricane of 1938.  The group welcomed Deputy Secretary Merrigan on the porch of the historic farmhouse, which had just escaped the flood waters by a few inches.  As we pulled onto the farm’s access road, a large grader and dump truck continued work to repair washed away segments. Rob and Karen Wheeler explained how they were humbled by the outpouring of support from their neighbors to quickly clean up and bring back their large field.  Rob also told the Deputy Secretary of his positive experiences and support for the local USDA staff.  She spoke of the signs she saw in Wilmington that read “Courage” and “Thank you for your support,” and even one advertising “Floodstock,” a benefit concert for disaster relief. She remarked on the resilience of the Vermont farmers and of course, farmers as a group, and also spoke of the challenges ahead for USDA and its programs. Our next stop was the Harlow Farm in Westminster, an 80 acre organic vegetable farm with a successful farm store and wholesale business. We were welcomed by owner-operator Paul Harlow who is well respected and widely known for his extensive crop knowledge.  About 30 vegetable and dairy producers came to speak with the Deputy, along with Vermont Agriculture Secretary Chuck Ross who had been assessing crop damage and meeting with farmers in another county.  Paul Harlow explained how over 30 acres of his vegetables were flooded by the Connecticut River. They remained under water for several days and Paul was forced to harrow under all damaged crops.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan emphasized the special place Vermont agriculture has in the national eye:  Local food, strong markets and strong community bonds are evident and to be commended, she said. The Deputy welcomed all conversation topics from the group, offered encouragement to work through USDA paperwork and talked of the approaching Farm Bill. Our final stop of the day in Windham County was the six-generation Robb Family Farm on Ames Hill Road just west of Brattleboro.  The family welcomed the group and once again we gathered around the porch of a historic Vermont farmhouse. The Robb Family Farm has been a dairy farm and maple sugaring operation for 100 years. They now produce corn and hay for their animals on approximately 180 acres.  They recently sold the dairy cows and transitioned to beef.  They added to their 2,000 maple taps to support their successful online store and mail order business, which sells maple syrup made on the farm. Charlie Robb, Jr., who currently serves as Chair of the Windham County FSA Committee, explained how a hay field and a corn field were flooded by the Whetstone Brook from Tropical Storm Irene. This same brook also caused severe damage to Route 9, the main highway between Brattleboro and the west side of the county.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan remarked on the farmers’ resilience and disaster clean-up progress. She also noted and complimented Vermont’s agricultural leadership. Area farmers encouraged the Deputy to support a strong conservation budget, especially mentioning the impacts of invasive species in southern Vermont.  Our visit ended with many handshakes and Deputy Secretary Merrigan posing for photos with our hosts and their neighbors.  Area farmers told us how much they appreciated her concern for them and the efforts of the local USDA “boots on the ground.”  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Tags:  Farms  FSA  Hurricane Irene  Kathleen Merrigan  Vermont",What role did outpouring support from neighbors play in helping farmers like Rob Wheeler quickly clean up and bring back their large field after Tropical Storm Irene?,The outpouring of support from neighbors helped farmers like Rob Wheeler quickly clean up and bring back their large field by providing assistance to repair washed away segments.
"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Jan 12, 2012  Mark Twery, a supervisory research forester on the Northern Research Station How does a former dancer and theater technician end up in a career in forestry? Meet Mark Twery, a supervisory research forester on the Northern Research Station in Burlington, Vt., who is not only all of the above, but loves his unique job that incorporates forestry with dance. Twery had a natural inclination toward the arts. His father was a painter while his mother continues to paint, and both of his siblings are artists in different respects. As a child, Twery toyed with the idea of becoming an artist himself. Entering college thinking he would embark in mathematics, Twery quickly realized he preferred theater arts. During his junior year, he spent a semester working at a theater in New York City. It was during a trip home to Virginia when Twery realized that he had been away from nature for too long. “I went outside and I heard a strange noise above my head,” he said. “I looked up and saw a cardinal singing. I am a birder but did not recognize that bird song. That’s when I decided that I had lived in the big city for too long.” This “wake-up call” led to Twery’s departure from theater in New York City to a brief career in woodworking in Boston. “It was good work, but I didn’t earn enough and again I began getting tired of living in a city,” he said. Twery returned to school intending to study wood technology, but instead entered the forestry master’s program at the University of Massachusetts. A Ph.D. soon followed as did a career with the Forest Service. Several years ago, Twery and his wife attended a dance performance in Burlington that weaved art and science. Fascinated by this connection, Twery, as a Forest Service liaison at the Northern Research Station, began working with the dance company to create the Moving Fields Project that incorporates dance to teach elementary school students, primarily city youth, about nature and ecology. During a typical Moving Fields Project session, Twery and dancers lead the young students to a nature area where they create movements based on what the children see or hear, such as “seeds floating off into the wind, or bark sliding off a dead tree or stepping into a pond and pulling your foot back.” Once Twery accompanied a group of inner city children from Baltimore on a Moving Fields session in a natural area, and at the end of the day, the elementary school students performed an ecological dance for their teachers and parents. Being able to combine his love for dance and forestry is one big reason Twery loves his job. “It really is true that artists and scientists follow the same steps of observation, analysis, interpretation, and communication,” he said. “It feels like I’m going full circle in my career by connecting visual and performing arts with forestry, ecology and the environment.” See what else Twery has to say in the Forest Service special feature Faces of the Forest, a bi-weekly feature of the Office of Communication to showcase the people, places and professions within the agency.

As part of this global event, every month this year USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will profile careers of individuals who are making significant contributions to improve agricultural statistics in the United States. Growing up on a small general crop and livestock farm in central Minnesota cultivated my enthusiasm for agriculture. Even then I knew I wanted to do something related to agriculture but I also knew the value of getting a good education. I attended the University of Minnesota to earn my undergraduate degree, after which I earned a Master of Science degree at North Dakota State University. College provided me with skills in mathematics and agriculture but like most college graduates, no job. This is where the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) came into the picture. I joined the agency’s North Dakota field office as an agricultural statistician, allowing me to keep in touch with agriculture. Next I worked in the Idaho field office and then on to Washington, D.C. where I worked in both crops and livestock areas, finally settling into my current position as Chief of the Livestock Branch in 2001.

"A Root Beer-Based Discovery that Saved Lives  Science can do more than improve people’s lives; sometimes it can save them. Consider the contributions of the late Allene Rosalind Jeanes, an Agricultural Research Service (ARS) chemist at what is now the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Illinois. Her efforts are particularly worth celebrating this Veteran’s Day. Jeanes studied polymers (large molecules composed of many repeated subunits) found in corn, wheat and wood. She spent long hours investigating how bacteria could produce polymers in huge fermentation vats. Eventually, she found a way to mass produce dextran, a type of polymer, so that it could be used as a blood volume “expander” to sustain accident and trauma victims who have lost massive amounts of blood and need to get to a hospital for a transfusion.

"Genomics and Precision Agriculture: The Future of Farming  For nearly 400 years, Thanksgiving has been a time in North America when families come together to celebrate food and agriculture. As we reflect on yet another year, agricultural scientists at USDA continue to keep a wary eye on the future. At the end of what may be the hottest year on record, a period of drought has threatened the heart of one of the most important agricultural production zones in the United States. Water demands are increasing, and disease and pest pressures are continually evolving. This challenges our farmers’ ability to raise livestock and crops.  How are science and technology going to address the problems facing our food supply?  To find answers, agricultural scientists turn to data—big data.  Genomics, the field of science responsible for cataloging billions of DNA base pairs that encode thousands of genes in an organism, is fundamentally changing our understanding of plants and animals.  USDA has already helped to fund and collect genomes for 25 crop plant species, important livestock and fish species, and numerous bacteria, fungi, and insect species related to agricultural production. Other USDA-supported research projects expanding these efforts are currently underway, including genome sequencing of 1,000 bulls and 5,000 insect species in the i5K initiative. But classifying and understanding DNA is only part of the story.  Samuel Crowell, AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow/ Advisor, Office of the Chief Scientist  Posted in  Research and Science  Nov 19, 2015  6 Responses","What role do genomics and big data play in addressing challenges to agricultural production, such as drought and disease pressures, through collaboration with scientists at USDA?","Genomics and big data play a crucial role in addressing challenges to agricultural production by providing a deeper understanding of plants and animals, allowing for more effective classification and management of crop and livestock species, and informing decisions to improve yields, reduce disease and pest pressures, and optimize resource use."
"Participants in Open Data Roundtables Guide USDA on Ways to Provide High Quality Data to Users  “Find out who your audience and users are, then figure out the best, easiest way to provide data to them.” Last week, the Obama Administration focused on a specific climate risk – the risk to the food supply – and the ways data could be used to help increase “food resilience.” The goal is to make data, computational power, and analytic tools available to help food producers, distributors, and inspectors keep the food supply reliable and robust. As part of that effort, last Friday the GovLab and the USDA co-hosted an Open Data Roundtable on food resilience to bring together government officials, companies, and nonprofits to improve the use of data on climate and agriculture. Like the Roundtable we hosted with the White House and the Department of Commerce in June, this event was designed to promote a dialogue between government agencies that supply data and the companies and organizations that use it. The ultimate goal of all our Roundtables is to make open government data more relevant, accessible, and actionable.  Joyce M.

"Consortium Uses Innovative Research to Tap Key Groundwater Source for Rural Region  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  As a major underground water source, the Ogallala Aquifer plays a key role in the economic vitality of vast stretches of the rural Midwest.  The aquifer covers around 225,000 square miles in 8 states from South Dakota to Texas, supplying 30 percent of all U.S. groundwater used for irrigation. But as with other natural resources that seem inexhaustible, the aquifer is effectively a nonrenewable resource. Demand from agricultural, municipal and industrial development on the Great Plains has meant that water is pumped out of a large portion of the aquifer much more quickly than it can ever be replenished.

"Illinois Dairy Farm's Waste Storage Gets a Makeover with USDA's Help  A dairy cow can produce up to 140 pounds of manure in a day. So for James “Jim” Johnson, who owns 150 dairy cows on his Boone County, Ill. ranch, that means 7.7 million pounds of manure per year. Where does this manure go? On many ranches, manure is stored and filtrated in a waste lagoon. But after a heavy rain in 2011 caused Johnson’s waste lagoon to overflow onto a nearby road, Johnson sought help to prevent it from happening again. In an effort to protect the quality of water and soil, he worked with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to find a solution. NRCS assessed his operation and developed a comprehensive nutrient management plan. The assessment and plan helped Johnson to change his barns to properly handle the storage and flow of manure.

"Public Affairs Specialist in  Conservation  Jul 16,  Wetlands are one of nature’s most important and productive ecosystems. They provide wildlife habitat, store floodwaters, filter pollutants, capture carbon, and offer recreational opportunities. Since , the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has spent $20 million to establish wetland mitigation banks to help restore and protect wetland ecosystems on agricultural land. To further this effort, NRCS is partnering with Corblu Ecology Group, LLC, an environmental consulting firm in Lawrenceville, Georgia, to develop wetland mitigation banks to help producers replace the lost functions of wetlands that have been drained, dredged or filled. Since , Corblu has received $1,170,701 through NRCS’s Wetland Mitigation Banking Program (WMBP) to develop mitigation banks offering wetland credits, which can be purchased by producers in Georgia. “It’s been wonderful working with NRCS. They have been great partners in developing this project for Georgia,” said Jennifer Pahl, Corblu Director of Mitigation Markets. “NRCS is very practical in terms of their approach to wetland restoration and they are responsive, which allows us to develop mitigation projects in a timely manner to make credits available for producers who need them.” The Georgia Agricultural Wetland Bank is an umbrella bank covering the state of Georgia, under which multiple bank sites are developed to provide wetland mitigation credits. The bank currently has two approved sites generating wetland mitigation credits that are sold to producers and plans to expand to a third site in . “We’d love to implement more projects on the ground and provide credits for folks who need them,” Pahl added. “We are already planning our third site and hope to continue expanding to other areas of the state.

"Regional Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Apr 23,  For the people living on Smith Island, the water matters. But it’s about more than the beautiful views of the Chesapeake Bay from the picturesque island ten miles from the mainland. The multi-generational residents depend on the surrounding Chesapeake Bay for their livelihoods. For many, crabbing, oystering, and ecotourism are what puts dollars in their bank accounts, and food on their tables. In rural communities like Smith Island, located in and along the Chesapeake Bay, aging wastewater facilities are in need of upgrades. Not only can this be an expensive problem for towns with small populations, but without the critical upgrades, the threat of combined sewer overflows from more frequent weather events and climate change could contribute to pollution of the Chesapeake Bay. So, what is being done to help these rural communities protect the environment and preserve a way of life that impacts so many? USDA Rural Development and partners are answering the call by investing in state-of-the art, modern wastewater treatment facilities in communities like Smith Island and many others located throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility Smith Island’s wastewater treatment facility consisted of two pump stations, serving the three communities that make up Smith Island: Ewell, Rhodes Point, and Tylerton. After four decades and prolonged exposure to the elements, the components of the wastewater treatment facility began to corrode, break down, and fail. This left the surrounding bay and wildlife vulnerable to combined sewer overflows. Federal, state, and local agencies collaborated on a solution: a new, modern wastewater treatment facility. Through the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program, USDA Rural Development provided the community with $83,000 in loan, and $5,000,000 in grant funds, with other partners providing the balance, to help the community afford the $22.3 million Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility. Peter Bozick, Executive Vice President of George, Miles & Buhr, LLC, the engineer and architecture firm that designed the new facility said, “The island is sinking slowly due to climate change and rising sea levels, and the former infrastructure was susceptible to flooding. In addition to replacing the treatment facility with new materials that can resist corrosion, we raised the pumping stations about five feet higher in order to be above the 100-year flood zone.” Read more about how this significant investment in improving infrastructure on Smith Island is contributing to a positive outlook for the future of Smith Island.

"Mountain Plains Regional Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Nutrition Security  Nov 08,  It was a sunny fall day in mid-October when I had the honor of visiting the Omaha Nation WIC program. Upon meeting WIC Director Jessika Free-Bass, I visited the Tribe's WIC garden, which they use to grow produce for client nutrition education. For the Omaha Tribe, nutrition education is a community effort. Free-Bass says that the Omaha Nation WIC program recognizes the importance of incorporating Indigenous foods and traditional cooking practices into the WIC experience to form a holistic approach to nutrition education. Recently, they have taken extra steps to spotlight foods indigenous to their community, as well as dishes and cooking methods traditionally used by the Umóⁿhoⁿ people. This year, the WIC garden grew tomatoes and WIC clients prepared tomato sauce. The garden also produced carrots, which the program used to teach ways to prepare baby food. The WIC garden is small, so the program partners closely with several community organizations to further its nutrition education efforts. For example, the nearby Umóⁿhoⁿ school garden donates squash and indigenous corn to the program for lessons. Omaha WIC also partners with the Nebraska Indian Community College, using their kitchen facilities to provide nutrition education sessions and cooking demonstrations. The WIC program aims to safeguard the health of income eligible women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods and information on healthy eating. As we celebrate Native American Heritage Month, I applaud the Omaha Nation for connecting mothers, young children, and the community in celebrating healthy, traditional food.

"Communications Director, Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Nov 30,  Since , FEED 7 Generations has worked to improve the health and wellness of Native people in the Pacific Northwest. Based in King County, Washington, FEED 7 Generations creates environmental health through land management strategies, community health projects, and direct food access projects. “We are a tribal-led food sovereignty organization,” said Executive Director Romajean Thomas. “We want to help Native people in our area be as healthy as possible while ensuring that our dollars stay within the local food system and within Native communities.” To further these efforts, the organization was able to secure a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant, designed to help underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. The organization is using this grant to strengthen local businesses and enhance food security and community connections. They began by conducting a needs analysis. “We’ve been out traveling to these farms, some of them really far out there, to meet with producers and understand their needs.” said Thomas. “We’ve had great success in building relationships.” Using the collected, the organization created a Native Grown and Gathered resource directory featuring Native farms and food producers in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. “We want to make it easy for Native people to eat food grown, harvested, made and produced by other Native people,” said Thomas. “This will help catalyze food sovereignty efforts and strengthen Native food systems nationwide.” The needs analysis also revealed that Native producers would benefit from additional training opportunities. With that, the organization hosted an annual food sovereignty symposium to showcase regional Native agricultural production and producers. Attendees could also learn how to start a food business, bring cultural traditions into the marketplace, and develop strong connections within Indian Country’s food system. Thomas and her team plan to coordinate additional trainings to connect food producers with the programs and grants offered by USDA. “We are able to identify tribal producers within our communities and ask them what they need, then connect them to appropriate USDA products that help them,” she said. “The grant has helped us to bring native food to Native people while enhancing the local food economy. We see this as a platform for our food sovereignty efforts for this region and hopefully nationally.”  Category/Topic:  Equity  Initiatives  Tags:  Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement  OPPE  grant  Tribal  You May Also Like  National Scholar’s Roots Run Deep in Agriculture  CAPAL Intern Driven to Change Food Insecurity  HEP/CAMP Intern Draws Inspiration from USDA","What specific initiative is FEED 7 Generations taking to connect underserved Native food producers with training opportunities and USDA grants, in order to promote food sovereignty and strengthen local food systems?","FEED 7 Generations is hosting an annual food sovereignty symposium to provide training opportunities for Native producers on topics such as starting a food business, bringing cultural traditions into the marketplace, and connecting with Indian Country's food system.

"The Program The Farm Bill created the Program to help underserved farmers, ranchers and foresters who have historically experienced limited access to USDA programs and services. The Farm Bill expanded the Program to include veterans. The objective of the Program is to show USDA’s commitment to ensuring that underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters can equitably participate in USDA programs. Grants are awarded to community-based and non-profit organizations, higher education institutions and eligible tribal entities with at least 3 years of experience in working with socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers or veteran farmers and ranchers. Individual farmers and ranchers are not eligible to apply for Program grants. Because of differences in demographics, culture, economics, language and other factors, there is no one single approach to identifying solutions that can benefit underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. Program partners are based in local communities and rural areas where they serve a critical role in maximizing USDA’s outreach efforts by identifying systemic barriers that need to be removed and working to increase equitable participation in USDA’s programs and services. Projects funded under the Program include, but are not limited to, conferences, workshops and demonstrations on various farming techniques and other efforts to connect underserved farmers and ranchers to USDA local officials to help communities increase their awareness of USDA’s programs and services.

"Minnesota USDA Public Information Officer in  USDA Results  Rural  May 23,   Walking through AGCO’s campus in Jackson, Minn., almost feels like walking through a small city. There are large buildings, busy people heading in different directions, vehicles humming up and down roads and the constant buzz of activity and production. If AGCO was its own city, it’d be growing. Officials from USDA Rural Development and Federated Rural Electric Cooperative recently visited AGCO to highlight how a Rural Economic Development Loan is partially financing an expansion project that will increase production and create about 200 jobs. The no-interest, 10-year loan is going toward a new 75,000 square-foot addition that will add a state-of-the-art visitor’s center and additional production space. The expansion is helping AGCO roll out production of the Massey Ferguson series and the Challenger MT600 series of high horsepower wheeled tractors. “We’re a part of the community here in Jackson and we’re proud to be expanding and adding more jobs in the region,” said Eric Fisher, AGCO’s Director of Operations. AGCO’s workforce is expected to grow from 850 to almost 1,100. The company is currently producing about 50 tractors per month of the new series.  Combined with current tractor production volumes the company will product over 2,500 tractors in Jackson this year. USDA Rural Development makes loans to local utility cooperatives which are passed through and re-loaned to area businesses for expansion and job creation projects. Federated Rural Electric and Rural Development have a strong partnership and have teamed to assist several local businesses in the region.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  USDA Results  Research and Science  Jun 24,   June through September is wildfire season in the United States and on June 18 there were already 16 active major fires consuming more than 102,000 acres.  As much damage and destruction these fires cause, even more may be on the way when future rains cause mudslides from soil erosion on barren hills.  That’s where “Woodstraw” comes in. WoodStraw® is a wood-based erosion control product that was developed by Forest Concepts, in Auburn, WA, using a Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) grant administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  This material is made from low-grade waste wood veneer and resembles oversized pick-up sticks.  Wood-based erosion control products have many advantages over traditional grass straw as an erosion-control material because it is heaver and will not blow away, is 100 percent seed and weed-free, and is effective on slopes of up to 70 percent grade. SBIR grants come in two forms: Phase I and Phase II.  A 6-month Phase 1 grant allows grantees to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed projects – and gives the government a chance to determine the quality of the grantee’s performance before awarding Phase II funding.  Phase II provide funding to awardees to continue their research and development efforts for up to 2 years. Forest Concepts proved its wood-based erosion control theory in initial field trials, where the product reduced erosion by more than 98 percent; it proved to be especially effective in reducing erosion in areas that have been impacted by forest fires.  Since , the company has produced more than 14,000 tons of material for projects managed by the U.S. Forest Service; the Bureau of Land Management; national parks; and state, county, and city departments of transportation and parks.  It has been used in more than 30 post-wildfire erosion control projects. In , Forest Concepts sold a license to Mountain Pine Manufacturing, Inc., to produce wood-based erosion control materials in Steamboat Springs, CO.  Mountain Pine uses dead, beetle-kill trees to produce material.  This process helps answer the region’s beetle-kill problem and provides engineered mulch that promotes regeneration of new live trees.  Production at both facilities creates sustainable jobs in the erosion control and biomass production and supply industries. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.  More information is available at: www.nifa.usda.gov.

"Will COVID-19 Threaten Availability and Affordability of our Food?  As the COVID-19 virus continues to spread in the U.S., its impacts have reached every aspect of our lives and shook all sectors of the economy. Amid this crisis, there have been widespread worries that the disease could threaten the nation’s food production and supply systems and stoke inflation.

"Food Economics Division, Economic Research Service (ERS) in  Research and Science  May 14,  The Food Dollar Series includes the industry group value-added series, which divides the food dollar into total value added (cost share) for 12 industry groups: agribusiness; farm production; food processing; packaging; transportation services; energy; wholesale trade; retail trade; foodservices; finance and insurance; advertising; and legal and accounting services. In , consumers in the United States spent $1.2 trillion on U.S.-produced food. Nearly all food starts out on a farm, but did you ever wonder how the value added from processing, packaging, transporting, and marketing agricultural food products factors into the costs? USDA’s Economic Research Service has a tool that can show you this breakdown. ERS recently updated its Food Dollar Series product. This most recent annual update added to the historical going back to . Aside from detailing what U.S. total food spending pays for, the Food Dollar Series tells us what consumers pay for at grocery stores (food-at-home dollars) and restaurants (food-away-from-home dollars). Of the $1.2 trillion in food spending, the largest cost share of the food dollar went to foodservices (restaurants) at 36.7 percent – this pays for others to host, prepare, and serve our meals, then clean-up afterwards. The next largest share, at 15 percent, went to food processors, such as bakeries, meat and dairy processors, and frozen food manufacturers. Rounding out the top five industry groups are food retailers, like grocery store chains and independent grocers , wholesalers of both food products and production inputs , and farm producers . The farm producer’s share is what they receive after they pay for production inputs like seed, fertilizer, and electricity. The value of farm commodities sold to fulfill food purchases represented 14.6 percent of the food’s purchase price, down from 14.8 cents in . Although was the lowest level since the beginning of this series in and the 6th consecutive year the farm share dropped, the decline in was smaller than in and . For the fourth year in a row, saw no increase in the farm production cost share of the food dollar. But unlike in -16 when the cost of farm production in the food dollar dropped sharply, average prices received by U.S. farmers actually went up in . This period also coincided with six consecutive years of increases in the foodservice industry share of the food dollar, driven by a continuing trend of consumers spending more of their food dollars eating out. So, increases in eating-out spending by consumers actually offset the likely increase in the farm production cost share, as more money went to food services.

"Chief Mathematical Statistician and Research and Development Division Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Jan 19,  The Census of Agriculture found that 14 percent of the nation’s farms are run by a woman. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  The Census of Agriculture is still two years away but, at the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), we work hard to continually improve the we collect. The agriculture census conducted every five years is the one time we collect demographic information on today’s farmers and ranchers. The Census found that 14 percent of the nation’s 2.1 million farms are run by a woman, and women make up 30 percent of all farmers when up to three operators per farm are included. Similarly, 25 percent of farmers were beginning farmers (ten years or less on their current farm) in . But, as we get ready for the next census, we want to make sure that our fully capture the role of women farmers and beginning farmers in agriculture today. After releasing the Census results and based on feedback from stakeholders, we began to explore better ways to quantify the participation of women and beginning farmers in the operation of U.S. farms, given the limited space available on the questionnaire. NASS has asked farmers to identify the principal operators and other operators on the farm. Often the senior male family member is listed as the principal operator, even if he is no longer working. If a husband and a wife are partners on the farm and share equally in the operations, the husband is generally listed as the principal operator. How should the questions be asked so that the participation of beginning farmers and women are more fully identified? Last spring, USDA Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden and I hosted the first ever USDA Google+ Hangout to examine in images and stories the experiences of today’s women farmers. It was an inspiring exchange that underscored how important it is for agriculture statistics to reflect women farmers’ roles as well. To address the challenges in collecting additional and to make sure we are asking the best questions, we commissioned the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) to convene an independent panel of experts. The panel reviewed the demographic questions on the Census of Agriculture as well as numerous other surveys. Input from stakeholders and the general public was solicited. The panel made recommendations on how NASS can best capture the changing face of U.S. agriculture in the next census. One of the panel’s recommendations was to ask about the characteristics of up to four decision makers (not operators) per farm and the specific decisions they make for the operation. We are currently testing this proposed change, along with others. We mailed a draft census questionnaire to 30,000 farmers and ranchers around the country, asking them to help. By completing the form, they will help us determine whether the content, wording, and design enable respondents to provide the information that policymakers, businesses, farmers, and other stakeholders need. Further revisions to the questionnaire will be made based on these results. By participating in the test, farmers and ranchers help improve the Census of Agriculture questionnaire and help us provide a more precise count of America’s farmers and their contributions.

"Lessons from the Field: A New Series for Food Hub Development  Since , USDA has invested in 29,100 local food opportunities, including food hubs, small scale processing and farmers markets across all 50 states and the US territories. These investments include over 12,000 loans and micro-loans to small-scale producers who often sell products locally and over 13,000 high tunnels (low-cost covered structures that extend the growing season and make locally-grown products available later in the year). However, as with any investment, the success of a business depends not just on an infusion of capital, but also on good planning.  Technical assistance services such as feasibility studies, business planning, financing strategies, supply chain logistics, marketing, and guidance with the policy and regulatory environment are equally important.

"Delivering Along the Food Value Chain  A recent trip back home to Louisiana sparked memories of a simpler time when old trucks full of fresh produce rumbled down dusty roads to deliver goods to the local market. The Census of Agriculture tells us that 50,000 farmers and ranchers nationwide are now selling to local retailers and that 150,000 of them are selling their products directly to consumers. Although these farmers and ranchers are still using this direct approach, the agricultural industry is certainly more dynamic today.  This means that producers need to follow a strategic business model. The reality is that food can go through a lot of steps to reach the consumer. Before it is served on the table, food travels from the field to the truck to the packing house to the store. My agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has many programs that support business entities involved in the food chain, including farmers markets and food hubs.

"Construction Begins on a Rural Kansas Fire Station with Financing from USDA and an Electric Cooperative  The City of Quinter, Kansas, had a groundbreaking ceremony for a new fire station earlier this month.  All of the city’s fire equipment will soon be under one roof, which will help improve the fire station’s efficiencies when crews respond to emergencies in its 400 square mile service area.  The new station is being built with funding support from USDA and a local electric cooperative. According to City of Quinter Administrator, Ericka Gillespie, the city of less than 1,000 needed a new fire station because the old facility was not meeting the needs of the community.  A larger space was needed for training, storage, and additional fire protection equipment and trucks.  The larger fire station will also improve the department's fire rating, resulting in lower insurance costs.

"USDA Rural Development Idaho Public Information Officer in  Initiatives  Rural  Jan 05,   Wow, the first emergency call out of the new fire station.  As I pulled into the driveway of the new Heyburn, Idaho, Fire Station for the ribbon cutting, I was greeted with the red lights flashing on the fire truck as the fire crew rushed to their call.   Initially, I thought about how much faster the crew can respond to the family who needs their help due to the improved location of a new station, thanks in part to the USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Direct Loan program, with funds for this particular station being provided through the Recovery Act of .   But then my thoughts turned back to the two days prior, when the volunteers gathered at the new station for an additional training session.   Some of the volunteers on that truck were the same volunteers at the training, who were once again taking time away from their paid jobs, to ensure their neighbors and employers have access to the same emergency services that I take for granted living in the Boise metropolitan area. Volunteer Fire fighters are known for providing emergency services, but now I began to see how they also contribute to the economic opportunity of this rural community.  Their commitment not only saves local tax dollars, but also helps build a solid economic foundation.  We know that construction related jobs were saved during the construction of the new station, but how many jobs will be created or saved as a result of the emergency services provided through the fire fighters service? During the grand opening, it felt as if the entire community turned out for the ribbon cutting.  Most of the organizations involved in the planning, funding, and construction were present as well.   Afterward, I was told how the voters in the Minidoka County Fire Protection District overwhelming supported the bond for the new station.   A sense of pride came over me - I was fortunate just to be a part of this celebration, I was honored to have met these fine men (and woman) who sacrifice for their community, and I was proud to work for USDA Rural Development where we have such great partners and a loan program that helps rural communities provide adequate facilities, equipment, and training to their well deserving volunteers.

"Caribbean Hub Director in  Mar 17,  Dr. Guillermo Ortiz of the University of Puerto Rico and rancher Neftali Lluch of the Lajas Valley in Puerto Rico discuss various practical steps to combat rising temperatures and prolonged drought. Photo credit: University of Puerto Rico We are living in historic moments in the world’s response to climate change. Last December in Paris, delegates from 196 countries signed an agreement to work towards curtailing greenhouse gas emissions and to keep global warming to “well below” 2 °C degrees. This is a big step, but there is still much work to be done and the agricultural sector has an important role to play. Agriculture, forestry, and land degradation contribute just under a quarter of anthropogenic GHG emissions, mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management.  Climate change also poses a great challenge for food security and nutrition. It can reduce yields and affect where and how food is produced. As the risks of natural disasters increase, farmers need to modify how they produce food in order to become more resilient to prolonged droughts, excessive rains, floods, and more intense storms. Farmers in the Caribbean are among the most strongly affected by climate change, as Caribbean countries are in general highly vulnerable to climate change due to their geography and socioeconomic status. So what farming practices can tropical producers use to adapt and minimize the impacts of climate change? The USDA Caribbean Climate Hub, located at the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry in Puerto Rico, is partnering with Universities and farmers in the U.S. Caribbean to release ADAPTA, a series of demonstration projects that communicate the best adaptive practices available to tropical producers. ADAPTA logo As part of the series, we are developing videos and factsheets that highlight adaptation practices in dairy, plantain, fruit and vegetable, and forest production. ADAPTA is part of an integrated communications plan to deliver climate adaptation practices to a diverse set of producers that builds on the assessment of risk and vulnerabilities that we completed last year to better understand the potential effect of climate change on agriculture and forestry in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. “Cattle & Dairy Farming in the Tropics” is the first video released and highlights adaptation practices for tropical dairy producers. Dairy is an important farming practice in Puerto Rico and St. Croix, involving more than 50,000 acres and generating over 25,000 jobs. Drought and heat have been hitting producers hard and have had detrimental effects on the livestock and dairy industries by making cattle more susceptible to worms, ticks, and dairy cattle becomes stressed and produce less milk. As grasses died due to lack of rain, producers in the U.S. Virgin Islands were forced to take measures ranging from collecting tree limbs and branches for fodder, to relying on imported feed and even culling herds. Pastures were so over taxed, that many will have to be re-sown completely at great cost to farmers. In Puerto Rico, producers saw their costs rise as they relied ever more heavily on imported feed. Many also saw their production go down as heat stress and lack of nutrients took their tolls on local herds. Unfortunately, climate models in the region are predicting dramatic changes in rainfall cycles, in which prolonged periods of drought are interrupted by intense rainfall events. However, there are measures that farmers can take to reduce the impacts of drought and increased temperatures, as showcased in the first video of the ADAPTA series. We believe Caribbean producers are some of the most innovative in the world. Through this project we hope to highlight and share how local farmers are adapting to remain successful in the face of climate change and other challenges. The Caribbean Hub is promoting cooperation by providing open venues and forums to address climate vulnerability as part of the USDA Regional Climate Hub comprehensive strategy to help farmers mitigate and adapt to climate change. The Climate Hubs are integrating efforts of the USDA Agricultural Research Service, National Resource Conservation Service, the US Forest Service, and other USDA agencies with state governments, local universities, and non-profits to help coordinate and streamline efforts to ensure the vitality of US working lands in the face of climate change.

"Agricultural Marketing Service Deputy Associate Administrator in  Research and Science  Feb 12,  Currently a proposal for an Organic R&P is getting closer to Step 1 in the creation process. While a proposal has not been formally submitted to USDA, a proponent group is working with stakeholders to develop a draft. USDA photo courtesy of Sam Jones-Ellard. We often talk about the many ways research and promotion (R&P) programs benefit both ag industries and the consumer. Our nation’s farmers and ranchers leverage these programs and the pooled resources they collect to help overcome marketing barriers and connect with consumers. R&P programs are self-help initiatives that are national in scope and funded by the industry to help these businesses continue to strengthen their rural economies and the communities they support. To form a new R&P, there are specific steps that the industry and USDA follow:  STEP 1: A proponent submits a proposal to USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which oversees all national R&P programs. The proposal typically includes an analysis of the industry, the program’s objective, and its potential impact on small businesses. While there are specific requirements needed for a proposal, the proponent can tailor the proposed program to best meet a specific industry’s needs. For example, some proposals include different eligibility requirements to vote in their referendums or an exemption for small producers, handlers and importers. STEP 2: USDA publishes the proposal in the Federal Register, soliciting public comments so that prevailing industry thoughts are incorporated into the final program. This is important because these programs will use pooled resources from across the industry to invest in creative marketing campaigns and innovative research projects that will support all of the industry’s growers, handlers, processors, manufacturers and importers. STEP 3: After the comment period ends, USDA reviews and analyzes the comments to determine whether the program has merit to move forward. STEP 3a: If a review of comments shows general consensus or agreement among the industry stakeholders, USDA moves forward with the proposal and a second proposed rule is published in the Federal Register to announce a referendum so the industry can vote on the rule. STEP 3b: If a review of the public comments suggests that a proposal needs to be re-evaluated, there are two options:  1) if the comments suggest a need to adjust parts of the proposal, a supplemental proposed rule can be published to modify parts of the proposal and request that the industry provides further comments; 2) the proposal is terminated. STEP 4: USDA conducts a referendum, allowing eligible parties to vote on whether or not the measure is approved. STEP 5: If the referendum is approved by the eligible voters within the industry, USDA issues a final rule implementing the program. For proposals that request a delayed referendum, the program will be announced as a final rule with a referendum to be held at a later date. STEP 6: Nominations from the industry are collected and a board is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to represent the interests of the entire industry. USDA seeks nominations from the industry for board members and alternates. These steps are intended to help the farmers and businesses establish a framework that will work across an entire industry and make the broadest positive impact for everyone involved.  Industry research and promotion programs have played an important role in shaping the agricultural landscape and yielding positive results for farmers and businesses throughout the country. For example, when research supports adding lean pork to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension – or DASH – eating plan, it helps consumers create healthy menus to meet their nutritional needs and it helps pork producers connect with a larger consumer base. And an August economic analysis found a return on investment (ROI) of $8.87 for every dollar the peanut industry invested into the National Peanut Board activities over the last 5 years. These are just a couple of ways that research and promotion programs are making a positive contribution for our nation’s agricultural businesses. USDA is committed to supporting these industry-driven programs, and ensuring that they address the needs and help meet the challenges faced by today’s farmers and agricultural businesses. Currently a proposal for a Hardwood Lumber R&P has reached Step 3 in the process. Public and industry comments are being evaluated by USDA. Photo courtesy of IndoGemstone.

"Secretary Perdue Proclaims April as ‘Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month’  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .19  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@oc.usda.gov  (Washington, D.C., April 1, ) – Spring is a popular time to move, but unfortunately, people aren’t the only ones on the move. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today signed a national proclamation (, 579 ) to declare April “Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month,” during a critical time when damaging invasive species known as Hungry Pests emerge and can be easily spread in the things people pack and move, such as outdoor items like grills, gardening equipment, wading pools and bicycles or patio furniture. Hungry Pests are a real problem. They attack trees, plants and agriculture, costing the United States about $40 billion each year in damages and expensive eradication and control efforts. Household moves increase the risk for the spread of these invasive species, since people can potentially transport them to new areas. About 35 million Americans move every year, making the possibility of transporting invasive pests high. For instance, federal and state inspectors often find gypsy moth egg masses on outdoor household items and recreational vehicles in non-infested areas. The United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) is offering a free checklist for household moves that includes suggestions and tips for reducing this risk. The agency is also working with the United States Postal Service’s My Move program to help educate the moving public about the things they can do to help prevent the spread of Hungry Pests. “Hungry Pests can hide inside plants, fruits, vegetables and firewood, and spread in a number of ways, like on outdoor items you move to a new home or on an RV that has been parked outside and driven cross-country,” said Kevin Shea, APHIS Administrator. “It only takes one person to start a new infestation, which is why we all need to be careful and understand how to stop invasive pests.” Here are key ways the public can help:  Moving to a new home. Help protect your new city and neighborhood from invasive pests by removing eggs masses and insects from your patio furniture, grills, bikes and other outdoor items – before they are loaded onto the moving van or storage pod.  Traveling within the United States. Before doing an out-of-state trip, make sure your car, RV or other outdoor vehicle is cleaned first. Check the wheel wells, bumpers and other hard-to-see areas to make sure they are free of soil, egg masses, and insects. In addition to moves, pests can also be spread by:  Mailing homegrown plants, fruits and vegetables. Commercially bought goods are regulated to meet government standards, including those for invasive pests, but items grown in a home garden are not. If you live in an area quarantined for a specific pest, don’t mail produce or plants from your garden to others. Contact your local APHIS office for more information.  Moving untreated firewood. Invasive pests like the emerald ash borer and Asian longhorned beetle burrow inside wood to lay their eggs. Don’t take untreated firewood with you, for example, on camping trips. Instead, buy certified, heat-treated firewood or responsibly gather wood at your destination.  Traveling internationally. It’s tempting to want to return with an unusual plant, a souvenir made from plants or wood, or even a piece of fruit as a snack for the plane trip home. However, U.S. laws prohibit many of these items from entering the country because they could harbor an invasive pest. Contact your local APHIS office to find out what’s allowed. And always declare these items to U.S. Customs and Border officials when you land. Failure to do so could result in unexpected delays and fines.  Buying plants for your garden. When buying garden items in person, be sure to ask the retailer if they comply with federal and state quarantine restrictions to ensure their plants are free of invasive pests. Before you buy plants online, check if the seller is in the United States. If they are in another country, you might need an import permit or other documents to legally bring the items into the United States. Contact your local APHIS office for more information. Finally, learn more by going to www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests or join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter. The website includes photos and descriptions of each Hungry Pest, and a Pest Tracker to find those in your state. To report a pest or contact your local APHIS office, visit www.aphis.usda.gov/planthealth/sphd or call USDA Customer Service toll free at 1-844-820- (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern). # USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender.","What should you not do when mailing homegrown plants or produce to others, according to USDA guidelines?","You should not mail homegrown plants or produce from areas quarantined for a specific pest to others, as this can spread invasive pests.

"International Affairs Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Feb 26,  Targeting over 80 crops, the Fall Armyworm poses a significant threat to global food security. USDA researchers tackle tough problems critical to American agriculture. Addressing how to nurture heathy soils, improve crop yields, or prevent livestock diseases, they carefully plan experiments and analyze that can lead to better on-farm decisions and more productive practices. But even scientists can’t always predict how far their work will eventually go. Recently, USDA researchers in Florida have seen their work take on unexpected relevance in Africa with the outbreak of an invasive crop pest. Fall Armyworm (FAW, Spdoptera frugiperda) is a destructive pest that can feed on 80 different crop species, including corn. Native to the Americas, USDA has studied FAW since the s. U.S. farmers currently manage it through integrated pest management approaches, combining the use of pesticides, genetically engineered crops, and other technologies and techniques. FAW was first reported in Africa in , and has now been documented in more than 30 African countries. Although we have decades of experience managing FAW in the United States, it is relatively new to African farmers, where corn is a staple crop for more than 300 million subsistence farmers and small-scale producers. The international community has mobilized to address this growing crisis, with U.S. Government agencies contributing their own expertise. USDA’s significant experience with the pest in the U.S. has positioned it as a trusted source of technical information on FAW biology and control measures. Studies by USDA scientists Robert Meagher and Rodney Nagoshi (Insect Behavior and Biocontrol Research, Gainesville, FL) provided valuable technical insights in the recently released Fall Armyworm in Africa: A Guide for Integrated Pest Management. With tips on pest identification, available technologies, and best practices for managing FAW, this guide was jointly produced under the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the CGIAR Research Program on Maize (CRP MAIZE). Research that started out with the objective of helping U.S. corn farmers increase their yields is serving double duty now, playing a role in African food security. Although you can’t predict what agricultural issues the future may hold, you can count on USDA research having a global impact. USDA scientists provided expertise and training for the new guidebook countering the Fall Armyworm’s destruction of African crops. Recently, USDA shared FAW information in the Feed the Future information booth at the recent USDA Agricultural Outlook Forum.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Apr 09,  Spotted lanternfly. (USDA photo by Lance Cheung) (Editor’s note: Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue on April 1 proclaimed “Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month.” The following illustrates some of the research that USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture supports to control invasive pests in agriculture.) Good things come in small packages, right? Not always. Oftentimes, what may appear to be a vibrant field of pastoral charm or gently blowing golden waves of grain are actually battlefields where small invading armies threaten the nation’s economic, social, and environmental well-being. “Nearly every terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic ecosystem in the United States has been invaded by non-native species, with economic losses estimated at $137 billion per year,” said Robert Nowierski, national program leader for biobased pest management at USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NIFA is in the vanguard of the fight to control, mitigate, and eradicate invasive pests, through funding and national program leadership. NIFA’s invasive pest portfolio includes sponsorship of four Regional Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Centers; establishment of the National Plant and Animal Diagnostic Laboratory Networks; and funding State Agricultural Experiment Station projects, the regional research and extension efforts of multi-state committees, and plant production and protection research conducted through the Small Business Innovation Research program. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques, such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, and minimizing the use of pesticides. Benefits of IPM include greater survival of a pest’s natural enemies, slower development of pesticide resistance, less pest resurgence, fewer outbreaks of secondary pests, less negative impact on the environment, and greater worker safety. In addition, many farmers report greater profits because they’ve reduced their expenses on pesticide. NIFA’s programs support projects from research discovery, through research and development, to extension education and implementation of plans. Some of the higher profile invasive pest projects include the brown marmorated stink bug, spotted wing drosophila, West Nile virus, and the spotted lanternfly. According to Nowierski, the spotted lanternfly is probably the showiest of the invasive species pests. “I was on an invasive species field tour last year and visited a farmer’s grape vineyard severely impacted by the spotted lanternfly. He lost half-a-million dollars from spotted lanternfly damage to his 40-acre vineyard in !” NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

As part of Bird Health Awareness Week, USDA recently hosted a webinar on “Growing Chicks into Healthy Chickens.”  Dr. Martin Smeltzer, Andy Schneider (aka the “Chicken Whisperer”) and Dr. Claudia Dunkley spent an hour helping backyard bird owners learn more about keeping their flocks healthy.  Around 300 people participated in the webinar, most of who are just getting started with backyard birds. The goal of Bird Health Awareness Week is to help protect backyard birds from disease. The webinar focused on the cute little baby birds known as chicks. Now, I am not a poultry person, but I love eggs, so I thought this would be something interesting to learn.  I found out that raising backyard poultry is a growing trend.  People like to raise chicks into adults for their eggs, and for the entertainment value of having birds in their backyard. I didn’t know there were so many rules when it comes to starting a flock. You need to think about why you want to raise backyard birds and what you intend to do with them.  You also need to find out if it is legal where you live - check city and local ordinances and find out if you need a permit.  If you have one, you should also check with your Homeowners Association.   Look to see if inspections or other steps are to start a flock, and be sure to buy chicks from a National Poultry Improvement Plan- approved source to ensure they start out healthy. I was surprised to find out that young chicks must be separated from older birds, for them to be secure and safe from disease.  Let chicks grow into birds in a separate, clean environment before introducing them into your flock that contains older birds. There are two major diseases that can threaten backyard birds - Avian Influenza and Exotic Newcastle Disease. The webinar discussed six simple steps to help protect your birds from disease.  We also learned what potential signs of illness might include and what to do if you think your birds might be sick. Are you considering raising birds or want some tips for adding to your current flock?  The full webinar is available online, including nutrition tips and other information to help you grow a healthy and happy flock in your own backyard!

Photo courtesy of Ray Hammerschmidt With support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the National Plant Diagnostic Network has grown into an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories dedicated to enhancing agricultural security by protecting health and productivity of plants in agricultural and natural ecosystems.  Dr. Ray Hammerschmidt, President of the National Plant Diagnostic Network, discusses this partnership and the benefits all Americans receive in the following guest post: Superheroes really do work among us. But, instead of capes and cowls and ice palaces and caves, they are often found in a lab at a public university or state agriculture department, wearing lab coats and working over a microscope. These men and women work daily to protect our communities and crops from dangerous pests and pathogens.  They are plant pathologists, entomologists, nematologists, weed scientists, and other plant scientists who work diligently to mitigate the impact of endemic, emerging, and exotic pathogens and pests that attack agricultural, forest, and landscape plants in the United States. We live in a global society where people, food, and materials travel in and out of our country 24 hours a day.  In addition to natural introduction of pathogens and pests – such as the hurricane that brought soybean rust to the United States – our ports, highways, and airports are also entryways for new insects and diseases that hop a ride on cargo containers, suitcases, and even travelers’ clothing. Whether it is citrus greening disease (which is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid and threatens citrus production), emerald ash borer (an exotic beetle that has killed millions of ash trees in North America), or purple loosestrife (which invades our wetlands and displaces native vegetation), plants, pests, and pathogens threaten our food and water supply and, potentially, our economic security. The scientists, engaged with the National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), are on the front lines and protect us from these threats by providing timely and accurate diagnostics. Established in , NPDN represents individuals from land-grant universities, federal agencies, state departments of agriculture, and other stakeholders and is an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories. NPDN provides a cohesive, distributed system to quickly detect and identify pests and pathogens of concern. NPDN laboratories immediately report their findings to appropriate responders and decision makers. To accomplish its mission, NPDN has invested in diagnostic laboratory infrastructure and training, developed an extensive network of first detectors through education and outreach, and created an enhanced communication network among public agencies and stakeholders responsible for responding to and mitigating new outbreaks. Their work is supported in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NPDN labs routinely support national, state, and local response to disease and pest outbreaks. They have trained and registered 11,480 first detectors nationwide. In addition, NPDN labs have been involved in more than 1 million diagnoses, and this number climbs daily. The network serves as a model for efficiency, communication, and integration across jurisdictions, especially in rapid response situations. Federal funding for the NPDN network is essential to continue to protect our agriculture jobs and global trade. More importantly, NPDN scientists protect our economic security by fighting against pests and pathogens, sometimes long before they are even detected in the field and have started to do damage. Superheroes do walk among us – protecting us from harm and ensuring that we all have a better tomorrow.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Fort Collins, CO in  Animals  Plants  Dec 14,   APHIS' National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) recently received the Colorado Governor’s Award for High-Impact Research for its development of the GonaConTM Immunocontraceptive Vaccine (GonaCon).  The award was one of four given to Colorado-based labs for their cutting-edge research with global impact. The Colorado state Chief Operating Officer Don Elliman presented the award to NWRC’s Dr. Lowell Miller during a banquet hosted by CO-LABS. CO-LABS is a consortium of research universities, businesses, state and local governments and economic development councils with a mission to educate the public about the value of Colorado's 24 federal research labs. GonaCon is the first single-shot, multi-year immunocontraceptive vaccine for use in mammals. It was registered in by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the first wildlife contraceptive for use in female white-tailed deer.  Not only might this new tool be useful as part of urban white-tailed deer management plans where traditional options are limited, but it also shows promise in other areas, such as disease prevention. GonaCon has been successfully tested in other mammal species, including elk, feral horses, bison, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and feral dogs and cats.  In addition to wildlife management research, NWRC and collaborator studies include the development of a combined GonaCon-rabies vaccine for use in feral dogs and raccoons, contraception for companion animals, and the prevention of adrenocortical disease in pet ferrets and spread of brucellosis in bison.  The vaccine is being used for research purposes in the United States, Mexico, Europe, New Zealand and Australia.  Future NWRC research with GonaCon likely will involve studies to support expanded registration to other species, develop oral delivery systems, and prevent transmission of wildlife diseases.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Jan 09,  Roadside sign promotes Texas recovery attitude. No one knew when Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on August ates. Texans along the Gulf Coast saw cities demolished, peak wind gusts as high as 130 mph, unprecedented rainfall of more than 50 inches that caused catastrophic flooding in areas, the death of 88 Texans, displacement of thousands of residents and more than $200 million dollars in agricultural losses. Traveling through Refugio to Victoria after Hurricane Harvey I saw the devastation to homes, businesses and the lives of so many – it brought tears to my eyes. Then I saw a sign that summed up Texans’ resilience – “Harvey was strong, Texas is stronger.” I immediately turned around and took a picture. Diebel (left) discuss NRCS assistance options with NRCS District Conservationist Kevin Isom. And strong is what farmers and ranchers have to be in their daily lives faced with the challenges of working in agriculture, especially when dealing with Mother Nature. Rancher Stephen Diebel of Diebel Cattle Company, rode out Hurricane Harvey at his family’s century old ranch in Victoria. He was unsure what devastation the daylight hours would reveal after listening to howling winds and pounding rain throughout the night. He knew it was one of the worst hurricanes he had been through during his time on the ranch. When dawn finally broke, Diebel’s first sight was the twisted metal of outbuildings and barns, sheets of metal like crumpled pieces of paper laying scattered across his pastures. The pastures and roads were covered in water as far as he could see. A sense of relief washed over him after seeing the calves alive and well. He had feared they had been killed when the hay barn collapsed. The calves often sought shade and shelter there. “I was in disbelief that the weather could cause such a mess. It’s hard to comprehend the workload ahead of you,” said Diebel. A busy cow-calf operation with many items on the daily “to-do” list like calf weaning were put on the back burner as the more immediate needs were undertaken by Diebel, his family and ranch crew. Diebel said the hurricane put the operation behind 30 to 45 days on cattle weaning since they had to get power lines fixed and water wells going again. He was able to scout the ranch looking at other damages and found the windmills had taken their last spin during the storm. The bent blades made the systems inoperable. Diebel, whose family has worked with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) on conservation efforts for several generations, realized one of his first calls needed to be to Kevin Isom, district conservationist with NRCS in Victoria. He knew NRCS would likely have assistance available to help replace the windmills with solar water pumps and panels to get the water flowing again. “With the cost of repairing windmills going up each year, it only made sense to take this opportunity to look at improving the efficiency and dependability of our watering systems with solar,” said Diebel. “The NRCS technical assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) have helped make improvements to maximize the land and natural resources, such as brush management, range planting, cross fencing, and conservation enhancements.” He filed an early exemption with NRCS so he was able to obtain bids and start the process of installing the solar pumps and solar panels. The early exemption does not guarantee funding for USDA programs, but it does allow the producer to install the practice before funding is awarded. Thankfully, flooding concerns were less severe on the Diebel ranch. He contributes this to the family’s conservation practices, particularly rotational grazing that keeps pastures covered in forage and builds healthy soil. The healthy soil was able to soak in the rain instead of ponding for days in the fields. As I watched the cattle enjoy the green grass that was abundant after the rain and listened to Diebel talk about how thankful he was that his family and friends were safe, I knew that even when faced with Mother’s Nature’s wrath, he like other Texans would rally together to rebuild and be stronger as a result of Hurricane Harvey.

"Rural Development Arizona Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Jan 24,   Rain poured through the roof of the old Black Canyon, Arizona, fire station, making the floor slippery and rusting the tin that covered the roof. Nonetheless, the one ambulance and fire truck that would fit into the aging metal shed still faired better than the other five vehicles parked outside. Those vehicles were not only pelted by rain and hail, but Arizona’s scorching sun baked them during much of the year—rotting the tires, fading the paint, and drying out the parts and equipment. Parking the vehicles outside also meant that the theft risk was greater, which increased insurance rates. A dilapidated trailer from the 70s was parked next to the shed. Three bunk beds were crammed into the small bedroom for use by fire crews. “It’s hard to recruit firefighters when they have to be housed in those conditions,” said Fire Chief Tom Birch. On January 21, a large crowd gathered to officially cut the ribbon for a new fire station for Black Canyon City. The new building has plenty of room—which means that all of the Department’s vehicles can be parked inside. It also has office space, a reception area, kitchen and three bunk rooms. The total project cost was $1.5 million. USDA Rural Development funded over half of that total. The Fire Department and their long list of building fund contributors made up the difference. That list of community supporters took two full pages of small type to list in the grand opening program. Chief Birch was joined at the ceremony by Fire District Board Members past and present, and the contractor and architect for the new facility. Also on hand were Arizona State Director of USDA Rural Development Alan Stephens, Bureau of Land Management District Manager Angelita Bulletts, Yavapai County Supervisor Tom Thurman and USDA Community Programs Director Leonard Gradillas. “Because of the distances involved in this rural area, our volunteers are to be here at the station during their shifts,” said Birch. “Morale has soared since we got the new station.” The Spacious interior of Black Canyon City Fire Department Building-Residents line up for a potluck meal.  There are lots of other pluses with the new fire station.  The station is built on land close to the interstate for rapid deployment, and because the vehicles can be parked inside, BCCVFD was upgraded to a Class 5 insurance rating—significant because that means lower rates which get passed along to their customers. Three days after Chief Birch and his crew moved into the new fire station, they were called upon to help with a fire in the brush land to the north. “We had a call from the State Forester asking if we could help by providing a pre-stage location for their rapid-response team,” said Birch. “There would have been no way we could have provided that kind of support and assistance before,” he added. “We had the space to be able to accommodate the equipment and the personnel.

"New Resource to Aid Land Managers in Adapting to Climate Change  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .16  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, Feb. 1, — The U.S. Forest Service today released a new report, Effects of Drought on Forests and Rangelands in the United States: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis, that provides a national assessment of peer-reviewed scientific research on the impacts of drought on U.S. forests and rangelands. This report will help the Forest Service better manage forests and grasslands impacted by climate change.""Our forests and rangelands are national treasures, and because they are threatened, we are threatened,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""This report confirms what we are seeing, that every region of the country is impacted by the direct and indirect effects of drought conditions and volatile weather patterns. Sixty million Americans rely on drinking water that originates on our 193 million acres of national forest and grasslands. They support 200,000 jobs and contribute over $13 billion to local economies every year.""The report establishes a comprehensive baseline of available that land managers can use to test how well their efforts to improve drought resilience and adaptation practices are working nationwide. Major findings from the report include: Drought projections suggest that some regions of the U.S. will become drier and that most will have more extreme variations in precipitation. Even if current drought patterns remained unchanged, warmer temperatures will amplify drought effects. Drought and warmer temperatures may increase risks of large-scale insect outbreaks and larger wildfires, especially in the western U.S. Drought and warmer temperature may accelerate tree and shrub death, changing habitats and ecosystems in favor of drought-tolerant species. Forest-based products and values – such as timber, water, habitat and recreation opportunities – may be negatively impacted. Forest and rangeland managers can mitigate some of these impacts and build resiliency in forests through appropriate management actions.""Since , fire seasons have grown longer and the frequency, size and severity of wildland fires have increased,"" said Vilsack. ""Among the many benefits of having this solid baseline is the improved ability to identify where restoration work can help forests adapt and prosper while minimizing the threat and impact of future wildfires.""The assessment, a broad review of existing drought research, provides input to the reauthorized National Integrated Drought Information System ( NIDIS), established by Congress in , and the National Climate Assessment ( NCA), produced every four years to project major trends and evaluate the effects of global climate change on forests, agriculture, rangelands, land and water resources, human health and welfare, and biological diversity. Together these serve as key, science-based, resources for anyone working to maintain or improve public and private lands in the face of a changing environment.Edited by Forest Service scientists in partnership with Duke University, the document provides a valuable new tool to inform discussion, planning and implementation of adaptation strategies for land managers and policy makers. The collaborative effort, authored by 77 scientists from the Forest Service, other Federal agencies, research institutions and universities across the United States, examines ways to understand and mitigate the effects of drought on forests and rangeland including the 193 million acres of National Forest System lands.The implications of the findings of this report are likely to have far-reaching effects on the environment for the foreseeable future. As climate change drives temperatures increases and precipitation patterns change, drought–and associated disturbances such as insect outbreaks and wildfires-will only get worse across many areas of the United States.The mission of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, is to sustain the health, diversity and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. The agency manages 193 million acres of public land, provides assistance to state and private landowners and maintains the largest forestry research organization in the world. Public lands managed by the Forest Service contribute more than $13 billion to the national economy each year through visitor spending alone. Those same lands provide 20 percent of the nation's clean water supply, a value estimated at $7.2 billion per year.

"Conservation Outreach Intern in  Conservation  Forestry  Jun 05,   The beauty of watching a flock of birds migrating on the wing is a sight many enjoy.  Protecting their habitats to help them on their journeys is part of the work that U.S. Forest Service employees across the nation do every day. “Forests and grasslands managed by the U.S. Forest Service are critical to maintaining migratory bird populations, but Forest Service involvement goes well beyond the boundaries of Forest Service lands,” said John Sinclair, National Wildlife Program leader. “By working in local, regional and international partnerships, we conserve migratory bird species and their habitats across the Americas.” One such partner is, Wings Across the Americas, which invests in international conservation efforts. They use Forest Service experience and expertise to improve bird conservation at home and abroad. Scarce federal dollars are leveraged through partnerships with other agencies, non-governmental conservation organizations, local communities and private/corporate sources to ensure long-term sustainable projects that benefit birds throughout their range. The recovery of the Kirtland’s Warbler, a small song bird, is one of the success stories of the Forest Service International Program’s work with Wings Across the Americas.  As recently as , the Kirtland’s Warbler population was at an all-time low. Only 167 singing males were left. Female Kirtland’s warbler on a nest - Huron-Manistee National Forest.

In recent weeks, USDA requested a new round of applications for grants provided under the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant program and launched a handy FINI grantee locator map. The FINI grant program, if you’re unfamiliar with it, was authorized by the Farm Bill and provides grants to test incentive strategies and technologies designed to help SNAP participants better afford fruits and vegetables.

"USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 18,   I get to learn about a lot of great local initiatives when I make visits around the country.  On a recent trip to Dallas, I visited Metrocrest Social Services, a community resource agency in Farmers Branch, Texas, that provides services to families in crisis and helps them make plans for the future. The purpose of the visit was to learn how outreach workers from the North Texas Food Bank come to this office to assist clients submit applications for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Camilla Zimbal, social services director, gave me a tour of the agency, and showed me some of the other services available to clients. One of the highlights of this one-stop shop is a food pantry at which pantry clients may select groceries once a week. In addition to the canned and boxed food, they can also select fresh-from-the-garden fruit and vegetables. Camilla Zimbal, social services director for Metrocrest Social Services, explains how they get fresh produce for their clients to Audrey Rowe, administrator for Food and Nutrition Service. Community gardeners, farmers and individuals donate locally grown produce weekly to Metrocrest.  Produce is harvested early each Saturday morning from three nearby community gardens and a local high school garden and brought to Metrocrest for volunteers to wash, sort and display in time for a 9 a.m. opening. While clients are limited to once-a-week groceries, they may come in at any time for fresh produce. On a recent Saturday morning, over 40 people came in just for the produce. During peak growing season, when tomatoes and cantaloupes are ripening, even more clients show up for the delicious fresh produce, which is then delivered twice a week. Volunteers at Metrocrest provide recipes and cooking instructions for folks that may not have much experience cooking fresh foods. Recently, frozen chicken was available at the pantry. Volunteers made sure clients went home with some fresh herbs and cooking instructions for the chicken. Those who choose to donate fresh food also enjoy a benefit—providing fresh produce is a great way to give back to the community by helping fight hunger and promote healthy eating. Zimbal gave an example of a local couple in their seventies who picked bushels of ripe peaches from trees in their backyard and brought them to the pantry.  This was a delicious and special treat for clients and a sweet way for the couple to help others. Another example of thoughtfulness was the recent donation of tomato plants so clients could grow their own tomatoes. This kind of local food sharing is a great example of ways farmers and backyard gardeners can give back to the community and help provide healthy food to those in need. Camilla Zimbal, social services director for Metrocrest Social Services, explains how they get fresh produce for their clients to Audrey Rowe, administrator for Food and Nutrition Service.

"NRCS Helps to Keep Native American Traditions Alive  The 567 federally-recognized Native American Tribes are unique in their own way—from their languages and family structure, to their clothing and food. Tribes are working hard to revive their roots to help reconnect their heritage to the land, rekindle their spiritual bonds and cultural traditions, and raise awareness amongst future generations; especially tribal youth in line to inherit the land. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with the tribes like the Choctaw Indians, comprised of nearly 10,ates, to farm and harvest hickory king corn and other heirloom white varieties, and process them to make hominy. Hominy is made from dried corn kernels, but it is expensive to purchase. NRCS provides the tribe with technical assistance to help transform idle land into a hominy-making enterprise–enabling the tribe to provide their own locally-grown, fresh produce, and cut their expenses by growing the corn.

"Posted by the Equity Team in  Equity  Aug 01,  Growing up in a diverse community in Manhattan, USDA Equity Commission’s Elizabeth Lower-Basch understood the importance of civil rights, unions, and equity at a young age. Inspired by her upbringing, Lower-Basch went on to earn a master’s degree in public policy and began her career with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). At HHS, Lower-Basch worked on cash assistance and learned more about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the impact it has on millions of people. Lower-Basch’s desire to expand equitable access to food assistance for all who needed it grew from her experience working on SNAP and assisting children, seniors, and working people struggling to put food on the table. Following her time at HHS, Lower-Basch went to the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) where she currently serves as the Deputy Executive Director for Policy. CLASP works to develop and implement federal, state, and local policies that improve the lives of those in need. In her role, Lower-Basch provides leadership, strategic guidance, and support for the organization’s policy and advocacy agenda. Her work at HHS and CLASP has directly informed her contributions on the Equity Commission where she brought forward recommendations on how USDA can improve its efforts to reduce poverty and promote food and nutrition security. “I’m happy to represent those who cannot afford – or have the capacity to – take on volunteer opportunities such as this [Equity Commission], and to tell their story and advocate for their wellbeing and food security,” she said. The four nutrition-focused recommendations Lower-Basch introduced were shaped by her experience with the community partnership group at CLASP where she heard firsthand how limited or lack of access to programs and services can impact families. In the recommendations, the Equity Commissions asks USDA to continue to encourage state SNAP agencies to administer SNAP in a way that treats applicants and participants with dignity and respect and to consult with those with lived experience of poverty as they administer the programs and provide technical assistance on how to do so. In addition, the Equity Commission recommends the review and update of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), which forms the basis of SNAP benefits, to reflect the needs of today’s consumers and supporting legislative action to remove eligibility restrictions on SNAP that disproportionately limit access to nutrition supports by Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). “It was important for us to ensure the recommendations were informed by real people with lived experience, not just academia, so that they are actionable and impactful,” Lower-Basch explained. Nutrition programs are especially important during the summer when school is out, and childhood food insecurity is highest. USDA is taking action to address this through its Summer Nutrition Programs, or SUN programs. New for summer , SUN Bucks, also known as Summer EBT, is providing $120 in grocery benefits for eligible kids for the summer. SUN Meals and SUN Meals To-Go are also providing expanded options for kids to get meals at schools, parks and other locations. The expansion of summer benefits and nutrition support is proven to reduce child hunger in the summer by 33% while improving children’s diets. In addition, USDA has made updates to the WIC food program, increased SNAP benefits, improved the nutrition of school meals, expanded access to school meals at no cost to families, and more. All of these actions further the goal of equitable nutrition assistance for those in need, a pillar focus in the Commission’s Final Report. Since the release of the Equity Commission’s Final Report with 66 recommendations, USDA has been partnering with the Commission Members to host Regional Convenings across the country to engage stakeholders in meaningful conversations on agriculture and equity issues as well as opportunities that exist in their region and how USDA can be of service. “These convenings showcase how interconnected we all are and how much USDA does – and can do – for our communities,” Lower-Basch said. “Equity means everyone has a chance. We have an obligation to be pro-active rather than neutral in extending opportunities and supports.” “It’s not just the big policy or recommendation that’s important, it’s the details that matter too,” Lower-Basch concluded. “The equity journey includes making sure steps are being taken to implement the recommendations and policies so that all customers of USDA receive a fair shot at a prosperous, successful life.” The Equity Commission Final Report is available in both English (, 2.0 ) and Spanish (, 1.7 ).

"PhD, RDN, Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Equity  Mar 27,  USDA is proud to celebrate the second anniversary of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack’s vision to advance food and nutrition security. This first-of-its-kind, whole-of-department approach uses a four-pillar approach, working across USDA’s eight mission areas. These pillars include:  Providing nutrition support from pregnancy to birth and beyond;  Connecting everyone in this country with healthy, safe, affordable foods  Developing, translating, and enacting nutrition science through partnership; and  Prioritizing equity every step of the way. Leveraging the momentum of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, we are also doing our part to implement the National Strategy (, 201 ) on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. This whole-of-society strategy was designed to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. And the Biden-Harris Administration remains focused on the Strategy. At a recent White House event, partners pledged nearly $1.7 billion in new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. Our efforts to advance food and nutrition security also integrates the Secretary’s goal to make MyPlate a household name. As I explain in this video, MyPlate has been our national symbol for healthy eating for more than a decade. MyPlate.gov provides the guidance, tools, and resources that translate the - Dietary into actionable steps anyone can use. We are making our MyPlate materials more culturally, contextually, and linguistically responsive. And we work with more than rategic Partners across a variety of sectors to use common messages to communicate to consumers that it’s never too early or too late to start eating healthy. We even launched a MyPlate Instagram, which is loaded with healthy eating tips and recipes. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack Celebrates Progress on Tackling Food and Nutrition Insecurity As we celebrate the power of nutritious food, we are proud of all we’ve accomplished over the last two years, but we know we can do more and do better, together. Please explore our innovative tools and stay connected. We look forward to working together to help everyone in this country access nutrition education through MyPlate.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Oct 13,  School lunch sometimes gets a bad rap. But I am here to tell you that school lunch is amazing and looks a lot different than what you may remember if you’re a kid of the 90s, like me. Last week, I volunteered at my son’s school. As lunchtime approached, the students were lined up in two lines: packed lunch and school lunch. The teacher announced, “Today, the cafeteria is serving popcorn chicken!” Immediately, several kids jumped from the packed lunch line to the school lunch line. That’s when I knew I was in for a treat! As we were walking towards the cafeteria, my son’s teacher told me to try the zesty meatloaf. I was already excited for popcorn chicken, but I decided to take her advice. This is not what school lunch looked like when I was kid. The meatloaf did not disappoint and neither did the mashed potatoes and broccolini. I can say with certainty that the school lunch my son receives is far more nutritious than anything I would pack for him. There was also a fantastic salad bar featuring locally grown produce. Kids were piling their plates with fruits and veggies…especially cucumbers. Did you know that FNS awards grants to support schools in purchasing equipment like salad bars, to allow them to serve nutritious meals to students? You can learn more about these equipment grants. I happened to be visiting during Virginia’s Farm to School Week. USDA’s Farm to School Program awards grants to help connect students to the sources of their food through education, taste tests, school gardens, field trips, and local food sourcing for school meals. Schools and other eligible organizations looking to improve access to local foods in their child nutrition programs can apply for a Farm to School Grant between now and January 6, . Since I communicate about school meals as a part of my job, I know that they are the healthiest meals kids receive each day. But now I know firsthand just how tasty they can be! Outside of the amazing food I ate, the other standout was the amazing food service staff. They serve the children with such pride, patience, and love. So, to all of the school nutrition professionals out there, Happy National School Lunch Week! We salute you!

"Jr., Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Oct 20,  October is more than a time for crisp temperatures and vibrant autumn leaves. It’s also Farm to School Month, when USDA joins schools, farms, and community organizations across the country to celebrate the role of farm to school programs in getting healthy, locally grown foods onto children’s trays through child nutrition programs, including school breakfast and lunch. Schools, farmers, and other organizations that help produce or serve meals to kids through USDA’s child nutrition programs can apply now for a USDA Farm to School Grant. In , USDA will award approximately $12 million in grants through a competitive process that provides bonus points to projects operated by and serving communities that are underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected by poverty and inequality. USDA invites all eligible and interested organizations to apply by January 6, . The upcoming round of grants will build on the $70 million of investments in farm to school that USDA made this year, which includes the first-ever non-competitive grants for states to assist their child nutrition programs in using more local foods. Besides providing high-quality local foods, farm to school also empowers kids to make healthy food choices through nutrition education. The video below from the Royalton-Hartfield Central School District in rural New York shows how a USDA Farm to School grantee is using the funds to positively impact kids from pre-K through high school. As a father of young children, I believe offering children fresh, tasty meals plus knowledge about their food is a great way to provide the nutrition and education that will help them reach their full potential. Contact your local school or community organizations to find out if they’re doing farm to school activities. If they are, there’s always room to grow and do more. And if they’re not, there’s no better time than now to start. Parents, teachers, students, farmers, and community members can all become Farm to School Champions!

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Feb 23,  Dr. Kristal Southern can remember being certain of two things as a child. “By the age of 4, I knew I wanted to be a vet,” she said. “And by age 13, I knew I wanted to attend a historically black college or university.” Southern achieved both goals. She became a veterinarian and began a professional journey over the last 25+ years that led to her current position with the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) as a scientific liaison and the designated federal officer for one of its advisory groups, the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF). In this role she supports public health issues related to the safety of the U.S. food supply. She started her academic journey at Tuskegee University. After applying, she learned about the USDA National Scholars Program. “I was a good student and was offered other scholarships,” she said. “But I received information about the program and was intrigued.” Southern learned about the relationship between veterinary medicine and public health and the vital role USDA plays in both. “The USDA Scholars Program directed my future career,” she said. “It is one of the best things that ever happened to me.” Southern participated in several internships with USDA during her time as an National Scholar. One summer, she worked with the FSIS Eastern laboratory in Atlanta, Georgia. “I worked with microbiologists and veterinary pathologists to conduct testing to support regulatory decisions, consumer complaints, and foodborne outbreak investigations,” she said. “It was really interesting work that demonstrated the public benefit of our services.” The following summer, she worked at Tuskegee on a USDA grant-funded project conducting outreach with farmers and producers in rural Alabama. “Our main focus was on minority farmers,” Southern said. “We visited homes, businesses, and slaughterhouses, telling them about USDA and providing information on pathogen reduction requirements.” Those experiences, the people she met, and the diversity of services USDA provides cemented her decision to make a career with USDA. She attributes much of her success to mentors who have provided guidance and support over the years. “These are the people who fought for me in the rooms I was not in,” she said. Dr. F. Erich Hemphill , formerly of USDA, stands out among these important influences. “He prepared me for conversations I would have in the future and recommended me when others didn’t even know my name.” She now tries to pay that service forward by mentoring other National Scholars. The National Scholars Program is currently accepting applications for the -25 school year through March 1, . For more information or to apply, visit USDA National Scholars Program.

"The Program The Farm Bill created the Program to help underserved farmers, ranchers and foresters who have historically experienced limited access to USDA programs and services. The Farm Bill expanded the Program to include veterans. The objective of the Program is to show USDA’s commitment to ensuring that underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters can equitably participate in USDA programs. Grants are awarded to community-based and non-profit organizations, higher education institutions and eligible tribal entities with at least 3 years of experience in working with socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers or veteran farmers and ranchers. Individual farmers and ranchers are not eligible to apply for Program grants. Because of differences in demographics, culture, economics, language and other factors, there is no one single approach to identifying solutions that can benefit underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. Program partners are based in local communities and rural areas where they serve a critical role in maximizing USDA’s outreach efforts by identifying systemic barriers that need to be removed and working to increase equitable participation in USDA’s programs and services.

"NASS Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Dec 15,  I don’t know about you, but when the temperature drops, I find myself thinking of warmer climates. One location that experiences tropical weather year-round is Hawaii. But Hawaii’s warm temperatures aren’t the only thing that will have you dreaming of the Aloha State. The island’s agriculture comes straight from a wish-you-were-here postcard. The National Agricultural Statistics Service’s (NASS’s) Noncitrus Fruits and Nuts Summary (, 1.4 ) shows that Hawaii is the top state for several delicious commodities. Coffee production use in Hawaii for - totaled 22.7 million pounds. Hawaii was also the top state for papaya and macadamia nuts in . According to the Census of Agriculture (, 28 ), Hawaii leads the way in farms and acreage for pineapple, taro and bananas. Of the 50 states, Hawaii accounts for 99% of pineapple acreage, 96% of taro acreage, and more than half of the country’s banana acreage. The last census also found that there were 7,328 farms in Hawaii, a 5% increase since the previous census in . That’s good news for those who love the tropical flavors the islands provide. The Census of Agriculture will be another chance for Hawaii’s farmers to tell their story and help shape the future of agriculture in their counties, state and country. Every operation, from the smallest to the largest, and every commodity counts. It’s critical that all producers respond – more voices mean better . If you are a producer, make sure your voice is heard. If you do not currently receive NASS surveys and censuses, sign up to be counted today.

"APHIS Animal Care in  Animals  Oct 22,  Megan Helsel was always interested in wildlife, especially wild birds. When she was working at a veterinary clinic, she met a client who was wearing a USDA APHIS t-shirt and struck up a conversation. “I didn’t know anything about the agency,” Megan said, “but once I learned about it, I was immediately interested.” That led Megan to apply for a position as a biological science technician with APHIS’ Wildlife Services. Megan’s job involves, among other things, keeping birds away from airports and hopefully preventing another “Miracle on the Hudson.” In October , Megan was paralyzed from the waist down after undergoing emergency spinal surgery. Although doctors told Megan she would never walk again, she enrolled in an intensive rehabilitation program to build back her strength and endurance. “All I could think about was getting back to work and doing what I loved,” Megan said. Six months later, Megan returned to work. Her supervisors helped her make modifications to accommodate her physical disability. A flexible schedule allowed Megan to gradually increase work hours and assignments. Megan had to get creative and adapt to new challenges. She used a cart and ratchet strap attached to her waist to carry her kayak to the shore and launch it. She also used two canes when she walked and carried heavy items in a backpack to keep her hands free. “I have become physically and mentally stronger with each new project,” she said. She encourages all employees to be open about what they can and cannot do, and to ask for the resources they need. “There are reasonable accommodations for many positions,” she said. Megan aims to have a long career with APHIS. “The support I’ve received has helped me to come back stronger and bring that strength, creativity, and resilience to my work.”  Category/Topic:  Animals  Tags:  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  You May Also Like  Preserving Tradition: APHIS’ Role in Safeguarding Cherry Trees  USDA Scientists Collaborate to Protect Endangered Species for Extinction  From Rats to Readiness: APHIS & MIZZOU Join Forces to Protect You from Future Zoonotic Threats","What strategies does Megan Helsel employ to demonstrate creativity and resilience in her work with APHIS, particularly after experiencing a significant physical disability?","Megan Helsel employs creative strategies such as using a cart and ratchet strap to carry heavy items, adapting a flexible schedule, and asking for resources to accommodate her physical disability, demonstrating her resilience and determination to continue working effectively with APHIS."
"National Agriculture Day: How USDA is Growing a Climate for Tomorrow by Transforming our Food System Today  Almost two years ago, reflecting on lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and in light of ongoing supply chain challenges from global conflict and a changing climate, Secretary Vilsack announced a new framework at USDA for shoring up the food supply chain and transforming the food system to be fairer, more competitive, more resilient. We’ve since called this our Food System Transformation – and as we celebrate National Agriculture Day and this year’s theme “Agriculture: Growing a Climate for Tomorrow,” I’m thrilled to share some updates on our work.  Jenny Moffitt, USDA Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs  Posted in  Equity  Farming  Food and Nutrition  Organic  Mar 19,   Respond to this story","What specific initiatives has the USDA taken under its ""Food System Transformation"" framework to make the food system more resilient in the face of climate change and global disruptions?","The USDA has not explicitly mentioned specific initiatives it has undertaken under its ""Food System Transformation"" framework, beyond announcing a new framework for shoring up the food supply chain."
"Acting National Coordinator for USDA Climate Hubs, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy in  Climate  Farming  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 08,  In June , Secretary Vilsack outlined a vision for agricultural solutions to environmental challenges, which included creating the Regional Climate Hubs. In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests. Early career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. “Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said. “Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said. The Climate Hubs continue to build capacity to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.

"Posted by Dr. Lisa Ramírez, Director of the USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Nov 09,  At the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), we understand the essential role that veterans, military spouses, and transitioning service members can play in revitalizing and strengthening our agricultural industry. This is one of the reasons we provide a range of training resources and support. USDA’s Military Veterans Agricultural Liaison, or MVAL, connects veterans to resources within and outside USDA to help them embark on successful careers in agriculture. These efforts also help move USDA closer to its goal of developing a workforce in which 25 percent of all employees are veterans. Last week, for the first time, USDA’s Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement, Farm Service Agency, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Rural Development, Risk Management Agency, Farmer Veterans Coalition, and the National AgrAbility Project partnered with the New England Veterans Business Outreach Center to present a webinar outlining the basics on beginning a farming or ranching career, finding employment at USDA, and more. Almost 600 veterans, transitioning veterans and military spouses participated. Many, including Army Veteran Billy VanCuren, expressed enthusiasm and appreciation for the resources offered. “This training has been extremely informative,” he said. “I've been looking for over a year at various organizations and websites, but the resources have all been compiled into this one webinar, which has given me several solid directions to pursue.” Much of the information shared is described in USDA’s “Get Started! A Guide to USDA Resources for Historically Underserved Farmers and Ranchers” book. This publication describes assistance and targeted opportunities available to minority, women, veteran, beginning and limited resource producers and is available in multiple languages. Other USDA resources that veterans can access directly include:  The AgrAbility project, which offers training and financial assistance to military veterans as well as beginning farmers with disabilities.  The Farm Service Agency, which offers loans to help farmers and ranchers get the financing they need to start, expand or maintain a family farm.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service, which provides free technical and financial assistance for conservation work on farm and ranches of all sizes, including urban gardens.  The Office of Urban Agriculture and Innovative Production, which offers technical and financial assistance various growing operations, including community farms and gardens. Please visit USDA’s web page for veterans to learn more about employment, education, and entrepreneurship opportunities available through USDA, and to reach out to the MVAL, Monshi “Ram” Ramdass, for more information at veterans@usda.gov. On behalf of USDA and as a veteran myself, I would like to thank all veterans for their service. USDA is committed to your success, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

"Administrator of USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) in  Equity  Initiatives  May 19,   May marks Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. America is home to more than 20.6 million people whose ancestors came to our country from Asia and the Pacific. Many serve at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I am the daughter of a Japanese immigrant that arrived in the United States in the s. Within our own USDA agency, we have several employees of Chinese, Korean, and Pacific Islander heritage. “This month magnifies the amazing cultures of the Asian and Pacific Islander communities and historical contributions we have made to society,” says Guadalupe (Lupe) Calceta, Risk Management Specialist with USDA’s Risk Management Agency. Lupe is of Filipino heritage and her family moved to Guam when she was three years old. Today she works for USDA in Davis, California. “The biggest difference between life growing up in Guam compared to the mainland is the much slower pace - life is simpler surrounded by beautiful beaches,” she says with a smile. Lupe joined USDA in . She says the Department’s commitment to keeping farmers and ranchers in business through tough times and helping underserved producers drew her interest. “This year, I am excited to be a part of two teams that will conduct outreach to Guam and the Virgin Islands,” she mentions excitedly. “It gives me such a great sense of accomplishment and pride in providing this service to my island.” Lupe’s team will gather and survey each island’s potential crop insurance needs. Another goal is to provide the local growers general knowledge of USDA services. “During and after World War II, local farmers suffered a loss of agricultural land,” Lupe explains. “However, through USDA funding and other resources, in Guam had 264 farms, up 154-percent from 104 farms in .” USDA continually strives to expand the reach of Federal crop insurance so that farmers and ranchers across America can benefit from the best farm safety net in the world. “Outreach work is important because it increases the public’s awareness of USDA’s programs and services,” Lupe says. “Outreach will ensure that these programs and services are equitable and made available to all.” I am grateful for the hard work of employees like Lupe. Please take a moment this month to reflect on the contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to our nation and the work ahead as we continue to ensure our programs reach all Americans.

"Public Affairs Specialist for FPAC in  Farming  Climate  Conservation  Forestry  Inflation Reduction Act  Mar 21,  Fifty years after the creation of National Agriculture Day, America’s farmers, ranchers and private forestland owners find themselves on the front lines of climate change. They are uniquely positioned to deliver solutions by implementing climate-smart practices that conserve natural resources, build healthier soils, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and sequester carbon. National Agriculture Day is a day to recognize the best stewards of our land: America's agricultural producers. They are not only providing food, forage, and fiber for today, they are also growing a climate for tomorrow. USDA is growing a climate for success for all people involved in farming, ranching and private forest land management. We are working to create an equitable and climate-smart food and agriculture economy built to support both rural and urban communities and empower producers who feed the world; improve the health, nutrition, and quality of life of all Americans; and yield healthy lands, forests, and clean water. From crop insurance to farm loans, and from conservation to disaster assistance, USDA programs are helping producers conserve natural resources and keep families farming for future generations. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) represents the single largest investment in climate and clean energy solutions in American history. This is an historic, once-in-a-generation investment in the rural, suburban, and urban agricultural communities that USDA serves. We are committed to implementing the IRA quickly and effectively to give producers the tools and resources they need to keep their operations productive and resilient. USDA can only succeed in its mission to help American agriculture thrive—and can only live up to President Lincoln's description of it as the ""People's Department""—if it ensures that the Americans who need its services most receive them. Equity is vital in all we do at USDA. We ensure that our programs and investments are available to everyone and we ensure that underserved producers prosper because of our work. USDA is working across its agencies to support urban producers to grow fresh produce, create jobs, beautify their neighborhoods, and increase access to fresh, healthy food in areas where grocery stores are scarce.

"Deputy Administrator for Office of Policy Support, Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Aug 09,   As directed by Congress in , USDA is re-evaluating the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)—the estimated cost of an affordable, nutritious diet. The TFP is used to calculate SNAP benefit levels. To complement the re-evaluation efforts and gather insights from those who will be impacted by the result, USDA recently hosted five listening sessions with SNAP participants, researchers, advocates, and others. Here’s some of what we heard: Families are struggling to get enough food with current SNAP benefit levels: Dr. Valerie Smith, a Tyler, Texas pediatrician, said she sees “too many families and children of all ages who consistently don't have enough food to make it through the month [to] decrease food insecurity and set children up with healthy eating habits for the rest of their lives.” Limited resources push families to make less healthful choices: “It is hard to choose between having enough to eat and trying to get healthier,” said one SNAP participant, describing the difficult choice to limit fresh food purchases in favor of packaged products that were sometimes less healthful but more affordable. Additional SNAP benefits can promote nutrition security—and make better futures possible: A member of the Association of State Public Health Nutritionists explained that increasing SNAP benefits would not only help families afford nutritious food, but also with “advancing overall health outcomes, lowering healthcare costs, and improving the economy.” USDA appreciates those who shared their time and their experiences with us, as we work to make SNAP as effective as possible.

"USDA NASS Public Affairs Specialist in  Equity  Research and Science  Mar 15,  Female farmers and ranchers in the United States play an integral role in providing agricultural products to our nation and the world. During Women’s History Month, we celebrate the 1.2 million female producers around the country. According to the Census of Agriculture, women accounted for 36% of the country’s 3.4 million producers. More than half of all farms, 56%, had a female producer, while 9% of farms were run entirely by women. These female-operated farms accounted for 38% of U.S. agriculture sales and 43% of U.S. farmland. Compared to male producers, women in ag are slightly younger, are more likely to live on the farm they operate, and are more likely to be a beginning producer. In fact, 41% of beginning producers are women. points like these from the ag census allow farmers and ranchers to tell the story of American agriculture. The inform decision makers who shape farm policies and programs, community planners and agribusinesses that target needed services to producers, and more.  from the Census of Agriculture, which will be released in early , will give us an updated picture of women in the industry, providing critical information to all those who serve farmers and ranchers.

"Posted by Food and Nutrition Service Public Affairs in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 12,  At the direction of Congress and with the support of President Biden as part of the administration’s Build Back Better initiative, USDA is re-evaluating the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) to ensure that it reflects the cost of a practical, nutritious, budget-conscious diet. The re-evaluation is based on four factors: the cost of food, nutrients in food, nutrition guidance, and what Americans eat. USDA plans to publish its re-evaluation soon. What is the Thrifty Food Plan? USDA develops four food plans that estimate the cost of a nutritious diet across various price points—the Thrifty, Low-Cost, Moderate-Cost and Liberal Food Plans. The Thrifty Food Plan is the lowest cost of the four. The TFP represents the cost to purchase groceries for a family of four – an adult male and female, ages 20-50, and two children, ages 6-8 and 9-11. The plan is designed to meet the nutritional needs of an average person consuming a healthy, cost-conscious diet at home. Why is the Thrifty Food Plan important? The Thrifty Food Plan plays a critical role in calculating Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit amounts. By law, the cost of the TFP in June each year is equal to the maximum SNAP benefit for a household of four people for the following October through September. That amount is then adjusted to determine the maximum benefit for households of other sizes. Why is USDA re-evaluating the Thrifty Food Plan? The Farm Bill directed USDA to re-evaluate the TFP no later than and then every five years thereafter. Since the TFP was last updated in , there have been notable changes to dietary guidance, food prices, and what Americans purchase and eat. The current re-evaluation uses the most up-to-date available to reflect those changes. For more information on the TFP, check out: www.fns.usda.gov/snap/thriftyfoodplan For more on recent TFP listening sessions, read: www.usda.gov/media/blog//08/09/you-spoke-we-listened-challenges-purchasing-healthy-food-snap-benefits  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Tags:  Food and Nutrition Service  FNS  Nutrition  Thrifty Food Plan  You May Also Like  SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food  Healthier Foods, Healthier Minds  National Women’s History Month: Celebrating FNS’ Unsung Heroines","What changes are USDA making to the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) as part of its re-evaluation, and how will these updates impact SNAP benefit amounts and access to healthy food?","cost of food, nutrients in food, nutrition guidance, and what Americans eat.

"Posted by staff of USDA’s Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in  Equity  Farming  Initiatives  May 18,  Renee McDonald, a first-generation sheep producer in Lee County Georgia, spends many nights monitoring newborn ewes. In the last lambing season at Sheepy Acres Farm, eight out of ten of her pregnant ewes gave birth to twins. The lambing season holds many memories, but it also presents challenges, including twin births that require double the attention. USDA has made a significant difference in the start, growth, and health of McDonald’s herds. McDonald, initially a goat producer, started her venture with USDA’s Farm Service Agency. McDonald accessed $50,000 through the Microloan Program to begin her operation, which she paid off in full in record time. She now focuses primarily on sheep production and has learned everything about small ruminant raising from the ground up. McDonald implemented numerous conservation practices with incentive payments from USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service. To increase production and improve forage availability, McDonald accessed the Conservation Technical Assistance Program to develop a conservation plan that outlined numerous practices such as rotational grazing and fencing. She used the Environment Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) to support livestock management through rotational grazing. Her breeding stock and ewes' nutritional state are primarily influenced by this approach. “Grazing in just one pasture, they’re more susceptible to worms,” notes McDonald. “Rotational grazing has really helped.” McDonald also keeps a small herd of cattle which she alternates pasture grazing between sheep to minimize parasites. Bovines and ruminants have different grazing habits, which impact vegetation differently. McDonald also accessed EQIP to support the implementation of various upgrades to her water supply. “I felt like I hit the jackpot” she asserts. “If I hadn’t gotten NRCS help, I would have sold out; I wouldn’t have been able to keep going.” Her father raised cattle and managed a Tennessee walking horse operation, until his unexpected passing thrusted the farm into a new season. A challenging but rewarding transition to sheep production has now paid off as she can impart her knowledge to others. Through mentoring other sheep owners, McDonald helps a new generation of growers meet the growing demand for sheep. Americans like her play an important role in agriculture. McDonald also accessed a small business loan from the Small Business Administration to aid her enterprise during COVID. “I am so grateful for all that these programs, as they have advanced my business by leaps and bounds”, stated McDonald. McDonald is now seeking a solar energy opportunity through USDA’s Rural Development Rural Energy of America Program to address energy efficiency on Sheepy Acres Farm.

"Public Affairs Specialist, AMS in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Oct 07,  The USDA awarded 55 grants to encourage the production and consumption of specialty crops. These grants will help new markets for American specialty crop producers and solidify local and regional markets. When I go to the grocery store or visit my local farmers market, on the top of my shopping list are healthy foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, dried fruits, and nuts. I know that these items, part of a larger agricultural group classified as specialty crops, are a critical component of maintaining a healthy diet and that it is important for me to include them in my family’s meals. Making sure that all Americans have access to healthy foods like specialty crops is a priority for me and for the USDA. That’s why I am thrilled to announce that the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) awarded grants to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 4 U.S. territories. These grants will be used to support 740 projects that encourage the production and consumption of specialty crops across the U.S. That means specialty crop producers will be able to expand their marketing efforts or alleviate some of their production costs. Others will increase education efforts, telling people about the importance of consuming fresh fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods. These grants will create tremendous opportunities for American specialty crop producers. When I look at the innovative proposals for some of these projects, I see newly established partnerships that will create new markets for American agriculture and help solidify local and regional markets. The local producer in Oklahoma can learn how to place their products in schools after following a business model that Copper Bear Farms will create with the help of one of the state-awarded grants. Some states will partner with local organizations to eliminate food deserts by developing community gardens or providing funding to a struggling food bank.  In other proposals organizations will partner with their local farmers market to increase the number of vendors or even add a new area where they can sell their products. In addition to the improved outlook created by these grants, pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea may soon offer specialty crop producers additional outlets for their crops. Passage of these agreements could lead to $2.3 million gained via exports, supporting nearly 20,000 jobs in the U.S. USDA is proud to support the specialty crop industry and help increase America’s access to healthy foods. Take a look at our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program page to see how some of these projects will improve your community.

All have us have a stake in working together to improve the health and nutrition of our children and in turn the future of our nation. Earlier in the week, First Lady Michelle Obama also attended the SNA conference to talk about her Let’s Move! initiative and its focus on raising a generation of kids to be healthy adults. The proposed enhancements to the reauthorization of the Child Nutrition Act that the Obama Administration put forward form the legislative centerpiece of the First Lady’s campaign and our efforts to ensure the health of our youngsters. We are encouraged by the leadership that the School Nutrition Association and others have demonstrated. Looking forward we are excited to work with SNA and other organizations to encourage America’s families to get involved in school nutrition programs and promote physical activity and healthy eating at home.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 14,  Jackson-Madison County School System School Nutrition Director Susan Johnson and School Nutrition Field Managers Rena Harris, Betty Willingham, and Susie Murchison. Credit: Jackson-Madison County School System In today’s installment of our Cafeteria Stories series, we highlight the innovative and successful school nutrition strategies that a Tennessee school district is using to positively impact the health of our next generation.  I believe very strongly in the power of student engagement, and the Jackson-Madison County School District is expertly tapping into that resource.  By empowering students and integrating them into the program structure, they have altered food culture and made the healthy choice the desirable choice within and outside of the school walls.  We thank them for sharing their story! Guest Blog By: Susan Johnson, School Nutrition Director of Jackson-Madison County School System Sometimes I hear people say that kids don’t like the healthy foods they are served at school, but what I see every day in the 27 schools that make up the Jackson-Madison County School System tells me otherwise. My staff and I see our students choosing to not only eat, but also grow fruits and vegetables, and educate others about the benefits of making healthy choices daily. At our schools, we are committed to maintaining high standards for the food that we serve to students so that they can flourish in and outside of the classroom. In , our district set minimum nutrition standards for food offered to students in grades PreK-8, which put us on the right track to comply with the USDA’s school meals standards and the Smart Snacks in School nutrition standards, which went into effect this summer. Enrolling in the Alliance for a Healthier Generation’s Healthy Schools Program provided us with specific tools, such as the Smart Snacks Product Calculator, that enabled us to not only meet, but exceed, federal standards at our schools today. Through nutrition education, we’ve created a culture of health where our students are so excited about serving fresh, healthy foods at school, that now Liberty Tech High School students grow much of their cafeteria’s vegetables in the school greenhouse. Last year alone, the students grew 2,664 heads of Bibb lettuce, 573 pounds of cucumbers, and 695 pounds of tomatoes that were supplied to six cafeterias in our school system! The USDA Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program (FFVP) and the “Teens Teaching Tots” programs have also contributed to a 22 percent increase the amount of fruits and vegetables that students eat at school over the last three years. Through the “Teens Teaching Tots” program, high school students take fresh produce from the green house to elementary schools enrolled in the FFVP. The teens teach nutrition lessons while the younger students build and eat salads with their fresh-grown lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. It’s important to me, as a School Nutrition Director, but also as a member of my community, that kids learn the benefits of making healthy choices at mealtimes. There’s no better place to teach them than at school where they spend the majority of their time away from home. Parents often tell me that in the grocery store, their kids point to strawberries, peaches, and tomatoes and ask for them instead of sugary snacks because they know how healthy and tasty they are from eating them at school. That’s how I know what we’re modeling for kids here is translating into life-long habits that lead to a healthier generation. Liberty Tech High School greenhouse.

Sanchez is the manager of exports at EB International and has more than 8 years’ experience in the mango industry. Meet Mariana Lizeth González Sánchez The future of agriculture is bright when looking at young people like Mariana Lizeth González Sánchez, a current member of the National Mango Board. With nearly 8 years’ experience in the mango industry, Sanchez is the manager of exports at EB International. In her role, Sanchez is responsible for purchasing, logistics, exporting and marketing of mangos. A National Mango Board member since , Sanchez says that her time on the board has been a major stepping stone for her career. She cherishes the opportunity to express her views with members from all segments of the industry – representing various positions as importers, distributors, and producers. After each meeting, she comes back with a clearer and more complete vision of the industry. When looking at the future of the mango industry, Mariana believes that the unique characteristics and versatility of mangos will enable it to be one of the most consumed fruits.  Every day consumers are more demanding in terms of quality and presentation of mangos which pressures the market to deliver high quality fruit. This in turn will cause consumers to demand mangos in many different ways, which will help the industry showcase that mangos are not a seasonal fruit but available all year long. As one of the younger members on the board, Sanchez encourages other young people to seek a position on one of the boards. She acknowledges that is a lot of work but feels it’s important to have everyone included in the conversation when it comes to setting industry goals. She feels it is especially important for younger people to join the industry and participate on the boards since the average age of our nation’s farmers is increasing.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Oct 21,  Almond growers are innovative in their water savings. This orchard uses micro-irrigation, which efficiently directs water. Photo courtesy of the Almond Board. It takes a lot of hard work to make a living out of farming, to build a thriving agricultural business and it takes ingenuity. This is especially true in rural America, where dedicated farmers and ranchers rely on each other and the communities around them to fuel innovation and create opportunity. From nutritional research to competitions that promote sustainability and continued environmental care, ag promotion programs—with oversight from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)—help American farmers make long-term investments that ensure a better future for everyone. For more than 30 years, California almond growers have pooled their resources under the Almond Board, focusing on research and techniques to make the most of precious water resources.  Efficient water use and irrigation management are vital to the success of California’s Central Valley almond growers, ensuring that consumer demand for almonds can be met sustainably.  State-of-the-art farming and production developments over the past two decades have helped farmers reduce the amount of water they use per pound of almonds grown by 33 percent. Key strategies have included the wide adoption of micro-irrigation as well as advances in soil assessment and monitoring. Innovative use of wood products is beginning to change the face of construction, and USDA is doing its part to support these advancements. A new prize competition was launched earlier this month, challenging developers, institutions, organizations and design teams to demonstrate the architectural, structural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in tall-wood construction. USDA is investing up to $1 million in the competition and nonprofit partners—the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council—have committed an additional $1 million.

"Chief Meteorologist, Office of the Chief Economist, World Agricultural Outlook Board and Rachel Steele, USDA National Climate Hubs Coordinator in  Climate  Apr 19,  A sampling of information available to attendees of the Regional Drought Workshop. (Photo by Tonya Bernadt, NDMC) Even before the Dust Bowl days of the s, agricultural producers have recognized the economic and emotional devastation that drought can cause. Recently, the focus has shifted from dealing with drought as an unexpected hazard, to more proactive planning for the inevitability of drought. One of the tools available to producers is the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), a weekly map of drought conditions produced jointly by the USDA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Established in , many sectors use the Drought Monitor. The media uses the map to communicate drought information. The USDA uses the map to distribute drought relief funds to agricultural producers, through programs such as the Livestock Forage Program (LFP). Some fire managers use the map to identify areas of potential fire danger. Policymakers may use the map to inform decision making, drought response, and relief actions. U.S. Drought Monitor maps are released each Thursday morning at 8:30 E.T. The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic, and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country. Eleven climatologists from partner organizations take turns serving as the lead author each week. The Drought Monitor is considered the gold standard in identifying the location and severity of drought events. Shortly after its release, USDA began using the Drought Monitor as a trigger for several of its programs. In fact, the and versions of the Farm Bill mandate the use of the Drought Monitor to identify areas available for LFP relief and to calculate the level of support available to ranchers, leading to delivery of more than $6 billion for that program alone. In recent years, the USDA and NDMC have made the Drought Monitor and its companion products more useful to the public, including the addition of a Spanish-language version, on regional drought impacts, and improvements to tools like the Drought Impact Reporter and an eligibility calculator for the LFP. Dr. Mark Svoboda, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center, describes the evolution of the U.S. Drought Monitor to attendees. (Photo by Tonya Bernadt, NDMC) Some producers who are unfamiliar with how the Drought Monitor is produced question its accuracy. To allay concerns, the NDMC has developed a series of workshops in partnership with USDA’s Climate Hubs, 10 centers around the country which link USDA research and program agencies to deliver timely and authoritative resources to agricultural producers and professionals. These workshops instruct USDA field personnel on the history of the Drought Monitor, how it is produced, and its role in providing relief to the American farmer. In this way, USDA field personnel can help the public identify when they may be eligible for drought relief programs, provide them with information on weather and climate patterns common to their region, and recommend steps to mitigate the impacts of weather and climate extremes. The first one-day workshop was held on April 5 in Amarillo, Texas. Attendees included NDMC representatives, including a Drought Monitor author, local and regional officials, and USDA agency representatives from Agricultural Research Service, Risk Management Agency, Farm Services Agency, Forest Service, Office of the Chief Economist, Rural Development, and Natural Resources Conservation Service. Presentations focused on tools such as the Drought Monitor, the Drought Impact Reporter, and the FSA Livestock Forage Disaster Program Eligibility Tool. “When extreme and exceptional drought appear on the landscape, it’s critical that USDA field staff have the tools and information they need to rapidly respond to producer needs,” said Dr. David Brown, director of the USDA Southern Plains Climate Hub.

Although a small operation by traditional ranching standards, Poe’s herd is no less important to him as a producer or to his loyal customers who rely on him for quality products to bring home to their families. So when the severe drought hit Indiana in with record high temperatures and absolutely no rain, Poe found himself without grazing acres and having to supplement feed for his cattle by purchasing and hauling hay. “My operation is small, which in this case was a blessing because I didn’t have to liquidate my herd,” said Poe. “Unlike many cattle raisers, this is not my primary source of income.  But as with all livestock producers, I care very much about the well-being and overall health of my herd and to find myself wondering how I was going to feed them, where the feed would come from and how much it was going to cost, was a terrible feeling.” Poe, who typically does not have to begin supplementing feed for his cattle until December, had to begin feeding hay to the cattle in June.  Although he had some hay stored, that supply was quickly depleted.  That forced him to purchase hay, which was in short supply and costly. Fast forward two years and Poe, through the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA), has received much-needed financial relief through FSA’s Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP).  The Farm Bill provides retroactive authority to cover eligible losses back to Oct. 1, .  In Poe’s case, LFP provided benefits for four months of grazing losses in . “Like most livestock producers, I like to stand on my own two feet,” said Poe.  “And while I made it through the rough times like the drought, I know that I will be able to care for my cattle properly and maintain the quality of product that to my customers are used to,” said Poe. Since disaster assistance sign-up began on April 15, USDA has received more than 81,500 applications. As of May 22, USDA has paid more than $235 million to help American farmers, ranchers and their families devastated by severe losses.

"FSA Public Affairs Specialist in  Conservation  May 14,  (From left to right) Dan Whetham, FSA district director, Scuse, Rausch and Della Meder discuss the hardships faced by ranchers who were hit by the Atlas blizzard. This post is part of a disaster assistance program feature series on the USDA blog. Check back every Wednesday as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s Farm Service Agency.  Richard and Susan Rausch lost nearly 70 percent of their cow-calf operation when Winter Storm Atlas dumped three feet of snow on the western part of South Dakota, killing thousands of cattle across the region. The Rausch’s 300-head of cattle dwindled down to about 90. “You just can't put into words what the devastation was like following the blizzard,"" said Richard. ""The roads were closed from snow drifts, but once we were able to get out with the tractor, there was dead livestock wherever you went. Our neighbor's livestock was found dead in our yard and our cattle took cover in rough country at the start of the blizzard and they ended up drifting five to six miles away.” The Rauschs are one of hundreds of farmers who suffered major losses during the unseasonably early blizzard last October, but a lack of a Farm Bill left them without any recovery assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “A lot of ranchers decided to try to make it through the winter with the livestock they had left and wait and see if the Farm Bill would help them,” said Richard. That help wasn’t far away. Farm and Foreign Agriculture Undersecretary Michael Scuse met with the Rausch family to ensure them and other producers that the Farm Bill would soon be able to help. Help came just a few months later when the Farm Bill passed. Within 60 days, sign-up for disaster assistance opened and within the first week more than 10,000 producers filed into Farm Service Agency county offices to submit applications. The Rausch family visited the Pennington County FSA office on April 30, to sign up for the Livestock Indemnity Program.  The program provides compensation for livestock death losses in excess of normal mortality caused by adverse weather conditions. They also signed up for the Livestock Forage Program (LFP) that will compensate them for grazing losses caused by drought and they enrolled in the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish Program that compensates producers who have suffered losses because of disease, severe weather, blizzards and wildfires. The payments will help the Rausch family gradually rebuild their cattle herd, make repairs and help with operating expenses. ""We already have disaster assistance sign-up appointments booked up until July,"" said Jiggs O'Connell, Pennington County executive director. ""Disaster program sign-up has been a busy time for us, but it's nothing compared to what producers went through during the Atlas blizzard."" ""We plan to keep purchasing cattle through the fall,"" said Richard. ""I believe it will take us two to three years to rebuild our herd. It won't happen overnight."" Since disaster assistance sign-up began on April 15, USDA has received over 13,000 applications.  As of April 24, USDA has paid more than $4.5 million to help American farmers, ranchers and their families devastated by severe losses.  Producers impacted by drought, snowstorms and other unforeseen weather events should contact their FSA county office to make an appointment and learn if they are eligible for disaster assistance.

"Office of Sustainability and Climate, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 12,  Parents and children at the Salida Montessori Charter School’s rainforest bake sale. The author used this as an opportunity to teach her daughter about forest products. (USDA Forest Service photo) Having learned about recent fires in the Amazon rainforest at school, my first grader came home with a head full of ideas on how to protect what many call the lungs of the Earth—and all the animals that live there: a bake sale. Her eager stance to rescue the rainforest was a perfect opportunity for me to tell her about the magic of temperate forests right in our backyard of colorful Colorado. I showed her how the forests in the U.S. provide a myriad of services and products, some of which would benefit us in making a batch of cookies for her rainforest bake sale. Conservation of our nation’s forests is rooted in our agricultural history. Devastating logging practices and deforestation during colonial settlement and through the Industrial Revolution resulted in fragmented forests and eroded soils necessary to sustain many benefits in which forests provide. These benefits include wood, fiber, food, recreation, wildlife habitat, and abundant clean water. Due to these concerns, beginning in the s, forest reserves were set aside. And in the USDA Forest Service was created to sustain through conservation practices the health of our forested lands. So, how do forests help moms make cookies? In many indispensable ways! For instance, the wooden cutting board, mixing spoon, and parchment paper we used to bake the cookies are sourced from forests. And while the cookies baked in the oven, my daughter and I went outside to find shade under a deciduous tree to cool off from the unseasonably warm September. When forests are healthy, productive, and managed as working forests, they produce an endless list of materials we use in our daily lives, from lumber to food to energy. In fact, per day, the average person in the United States uses 5.5 pounds of material derived from harvested forest products. Privately owned forests supply 91 percent of the wood harvested in the U.S., and the more we use wood products, the more likely forests are to continue to be forests. Recent studies show that strong markets for wood products—such as biomass energy generation—make maintaining forested lands an economically attractive option to private landowners. Back in the kitchen the cookie clean-up also involved forests because we used cellulose from trees in the paper towels to wipe up spills and chemicals extracted from trees in the cleaning products. We then bagged our cookies in cellophane to keep them fresh, and yes, a tree provided the essential chemicals to make this product. And, after my little one devoured all remnants of cookie dough, we washed the mixing bowl using water that originated from the mountains on the Pike San Isabel National Forest. Forested land in the U.S. covers nearly one-third of our land base. These diverse forest ecosystems serve as our nation’s natural filtration systems for clean air and water. More than half of our drinking water in the United States originates from forested lands. All in all more than 5,000 products come from trees and are renewable. If we take care of our forests and use them responsibly, they will continue to provide for us for generations. That day we counted even more forest products that went into making a dozen cookies, from the paper bag storing the flour, to the cardboard box encasing the butter. I then stuck a note to our plate of cookies that read, “From one forest to another.” Later that afternoon, after sampling our cookies, I sent my daughter up to brush her teeth with yet another indispensable tree product – toothpaste. This infographic illustrates how nature provides clean air and water and healthy soil from wildlands to urban settings.

"Rocky Mountain Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 30,  A recent tree planting and habitat restoration service project at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Wildlife Refuge was part of activities to announce $6.7 million in grants to support conservation employment and mentoring opportunities for youth on public lands. From left, Erin Connelly, Forest Supervisor of the Pike and San Isabel National Forest and Cimarron and Comanche National Grasslands; Agnes Mukagasana a youth from Groundwork Denver; Daniel Jirón a regional forester with the U.S. Forest Service; and USDA Deputy Undersecretary Arthur “Butch” Blazer were part of the tree planting and habitat restoration service project. (U.S. Forest Service) Agnes Mukagasana, an eager, next-generation youth involved in conservation, paused for a moment to adjust her hat in the afternoon Colorado sun and assess her well-honed tree-planting technique. She learned her skills as an employee of Groundwork Denver, an organization dedicated to the sustained improvement of the physical environment through community-based partnerships including federal land management agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service. Mukagasana and other area youth recently took part in a ceremony where the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior joined representatives of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation and several other partners at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. The ceremony announced $6.7 million in joint USDA, Department of Interior and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation grants to support conservation employment and mentoring opportunities for youth on public lands around the country as part of the President’s 21st Century Conservation Service Corps Initiative. Groundwork Denver leverages the funding through their Urban Youth Conservation Career Ladder Program to provide low-income, urban youth with natural resource education, training and mentorship, as well as hands-on conservation and restoration work experience. Mukagasana demonstrated her work with Dan Jirón, the regional forester for the Rocky Mountain Region and Erin Connelly, forest supervisor of the Pike and San Isabel National Forests and Cimarron and Comanche National Grasslands. They spent more than an hour together at the refuge planting willows to reestablish a wetlands habitat while also exchanging information about their work. Mukagasana will work on the Pike National Forest this summer as part of the 21CSC through Groundwork Denver. The forest recently experienced catastrophic fire and flood events, requiring rehabilitation work and the hands of those eager to help with restoration efforts. “We are excited to partner with Groundwork Denver to accomplish some much-needed restoration and rehabilitation on the forest,” said Connelly. “Just as important, however, is that we get to provide an opportunity for vocational enrichment and environmental stewardship to young people. These kinds of opportunities are a powerful way to connect youth to their public lands.” The grants will support 43 new projects on public lands, resulting in paid conservation work experience for more than 620 youth. The projects will also support nearly 1,550 volunteers on public lands across the country. “The USDA is committed to providing youth and veterans meaningful work opportunities that connect them with public lands, and accomplish great projects at the same time,” said Arthur “Butch” Blazer, deputy undersecretary for Natural Resources and the Environment at USDA. “By cultivating a life-long connection to nature, the USDA hopes to successfully engage the next generation of conservation stewards. However, sustaining this effort cannot be accomplished alone; it must be done with a diverse group of partners and other agencies who are committed to creating that lasting connection between youth and nature.” Makalah Emanuel, also of Groundwork Denver, spoke at the event about her experience working on public lands. “I have used every single thing I have learned. I have had experiences like trail building and I have applied this to real-life things like dedicating time to college applications and school. The work we do today and the work we will do in the future, it has a purpose,” said Emanuel. Soon, Makalah, Agnes, and 18 of their peers will start local projects supported by this initiative. They will work on projects both at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge and on the Pike National Forest. They will work to improve bison and prairie dog habitat, reseed plants and trees, remove invasive plants and restore riparian and habitat. Makalah Emanuel of Groundwork Denver plants willows with Secretary of Interior Sally Jewell. The pair worked in tandem alongside other government officials and youth to plant trees for rehabilitation purposes on a wetland area on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. The rehabilitation will support habitat of various local species.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 07,  Pacific Northwest Regional Forester Glenn Casamassa speaks at the announcement event for the Wild and Scenic River stamp series in Bend, Oregon, May 21, . The National Wild and Scenic River System spans more than 13,ates through landscapes as diverse as the rivers themselves. Just last year, the system celebrated its 50th anniversary. President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act into law with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress. On signing the law, President Johnson said “an unspoiled river is a very rare thing in this Nation today,” adding that unless there were steps taken to protect them, healthy, free flowing rivers would become a thing of the past. Since then, the system has grown to include rivers in 41 states and Puerto Rico. The USDA Forest Service manages more miles of these rivers than any other federal agency, including the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. These new forever stamps released by the U.S. Postal Service feature several of the Wild and Scenic Rivers managed by the Forest Service. Now, the United States Postal Service has released a new series of forever stamps commemorating the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. At the release event along the banks of the Deschutes River in Bend, Oregon, U.S. Postal Service chief financial officer and executive vice president Joe Corbett said, “When Americans use the stamps, either to mail letters and packages or to add them to collections, they will be reminded of our cherished Wild and Scenic Rivers.” The stamps feature photographs of 12 designated Wild and Scenic Rivers. Many of these rivers are managed in whole, or in part, by the Forest Service. Those rivers include the Flathead, the Merced and the Deschutes. These designated rivers and others like them throughout the country provide a wide range of economic, ecological and other social values. “Wild and Scenic Rivers are the backbones of many communities that rely on the visitors to fill hotels, visit shops and outfitters, and to hire guides,” Pacific Northwest Regional Forester Glenn Casamassa said at the release event. “We need to take responsibility for stewardship of these rivers in collaboration with partners, local communities and other stakeholders.” June 1 through 9 is also National Fishing and Boating Week, a time to connect with the great outdoors by getting on the water to fish, boat and even scuba dive.

"AMS Deputy Administrator, Poultry and Eggs Program in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 21,   During the holiday season, food banks across America experience a spike in demand and this year is no different. Today that seasonal demand is also bolstered by a significant rise in client numbers because of the current U.S. economy. One of those food distributors seeing an uptick in demand is the Capital Area Food Bank, a food hub with more than 700 partners that distribute commodities to locations in the District of Columbia, northern Virginia and parts of Maryland. Shamia Holloway, communications manager of the Capital Area Food Bank, said the hub has seen a 25 percent increase in demand since the start of the recession roughly three years ago, and the demographic of recipients has changed. “We’re seeing many more middle-class visitors, people who have never been to the food bank before. We’ve even had former donors return as clients.” Shelves of food at the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington, DC. The food bank has seen a 25 percent increase in demand since the start of the recession three years ago. Photo courtesy Geoff Livingston. USDA is proud of its support of food banks via The Emergency Food Assistance Program, which distributes commodities to supplement the diets of low-income families. In the early s, USDA established a food distribution program to shore up farm prices and help American farmers suffering from the economic mayhem of the Great Depression. Millions lost their jobs and couldn’t support themselves and their families, and the danger of malnutrition among children became a national concern. Several USDA agencies sustain the federal government’s modern-day food distribution program. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) manages The Emergency Food Assistance Program. The Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) purchases meat, poultry, eggs, fish, fruit and vegetable products; the Farm Service Agency (FSA) purchases dairy and peanut products, cereals, grains and vegetable oils. FNS then coordinates distribution of the commodities to states based on unemployment numbers and residents with incomes lower than the poverty level. The states disperse the food to local agencies, usually food banks. Every day the employees of USDA work to help support those who struggle to feed themselves.

"Native American Heritage Month - A Time for USDA to Consult with Tribes and Learn from Them  Late last month it was my privilege to join representatives from multiple USDA agencies at Wisconsin’s Mole Lake Indian Reservation to discuss ways to work together, across agency lines, to provide needed services to Tribes.  Thanks to funding support through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and other USDA programs, the Obama Administration has boosted federal support for Tribes, but now we are working to step up our effort even more, to work as one to support projects and initiatives that the Tribes have told us they support and need.  As we observe  Native American Heritage Month, it is important to note that this effort is consistent with Secretary Vilsack’s “One USDA” policy.  The intention is to have “one USDA speaking with one voice.” Because we are such a large department, sometimes those seeking services just don’t know where to start.  At USDA we are moving to unify our brand identity and broaden our outreach.  We know that when a member of a Tribe approaches a USDA representative, they don’t want a process.  They want an answer, and we should be giving them answers from all of our agencies. That was the message I shared with my USDA colleagues at Mole Lake.

"Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development in  Energy  Rural  Jun 09,   As a farmer in eastern South Dakota, I witnessed one of the biggest growth periods in renewable energy in our country's history. I saw firsthand how the investments in biofuels benefited rural Americans by creating jobs and capturing wealth locally. Leaders in the community got together, made commitments to invest in renewable energy projects, and shared in the success of the projects once they matured. Renewable energy projects are not only good for the rural economy, they are an important component of President Barack Obama's across-the-board approach to building an energy infrastructure. The path he laid out will secure our energy future and promote economic growth by out-innovating and out-competing global competition. Renewable energy production is smart for our country both strategically and economically. As gas prices have gone up, we are reminded that oil supplies are fragile and that global events and speculation can have a large effect on the price. Whether it is tumult in the Middle East or hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico, the long and complex supply chains for petroleum energy can be disrupted by a multitude of events.  This solar module, funded in part through USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program, is oriented to the south on a ground-mounted rack near a rural business in Tippecanoe County, Indiana.  Abundant domestic resources make the expanded use of clean, reliable and American-made renewable energy the best way to mitigate these risks in the long run and take control of gas prices. Producing renewable energy here at home not only increases economic and strategic security, but also provides job growth and captures the wealth of energy production in the communities that produce it. Building on the success of conventional biofuels, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with research centers and private businesses to develop new generation biofuels made from feedstocks such as switch grass, corn stover and algae. The promise of new generation biofuels is enormous and provides the greatest hope for our work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Additionally, USDA is interested in finding ways for rural Americans to use alternative energy technologies that harness the power of wind and sun. The wind that regularly whips through the Great Plains and across Texas can drive turbines that provide energy to individual farms or for sale to the electrical grid. The powerful sun in the American Southwest can heat the solar panels that provide the energy to operate a business or defray the energy costs in a home. One important way we support the effort to expand renewable energy generation and use is through the Rural Energy for America Program. REAP gives rural Americans the opportunity to take the lead in the production of alternative energy by tapping into all of rural America's natural resource strengths. The program supports, among other things, biomass, wind and solar energy projects from applications received from rural small business owners or agricultural producers. Under the REAP program, $61 million has been made available in guaranteed loans and $42 million has been made available for grants. Those funds can be used for various energy efficiency projects including anaerobic digesters on livestock farms, audits of energy improvements and, now, flex-fuel pumps. For additional information, refer to www.rurdev.usda.gov. With tools like the REAP program, USDA is helping rural America lead the way to our nation's renewable energy future. And we can't afford to wait any longer for our economy, our national security, and for prices at the gas pump.

"Forest Hydrogeologist, U.S. Forest Service Eastern Region in  Forestry  May 31,  Water quality is monitored by volunteers with the Monday Creek Restoration Project. MCRP photo. For nearly a century, the aquatic life that once thrived in the Monday Creek Watershed has been virtually dead. The goal of this Recovery Act project, known as ""Devastation to Destination,"" is to construct a healthy functioning riparian corridor, restore water quality, and create an integrated land management strategy resulting in species diversity among existing aquatic and wildlife habitats. It is located in Perry County between the towns of New Straitsville and Shawnee, Ohio. The drainage was heavily impacted by underground mining activities in the late 's and again in the mid 's from strip mining. The drainages were blocked by piles of old mine waste and soils. The estimated 60 million gallons of water that falls here in a typical year ends up in the old mines, producing acid mine drainage which is toxic to aquatic life and has a harmful effect on the adjacent riparian vegetation. Over the last fifteen years, the Wayne National Forest and our partners have worked together to restore the watershed, which encompasses 75,000 acres in three counties. In addition to interpreting the natural history of the area, the Forest Service also has the opportunity to educate the public about the importance of continued cleanup of old abandoned mine lands. Numerous features are incorporated in the project’s clean-up activities including: opening all blocked drainages and allowing the water to flow freely from the site, creating a prairie meadow on the upper slope of the site, building a pond stocked by Ohio Department of Natural Resources with three species of fish, and planting approximately 1,300 native species suitable for each habitat created. Partners in the project include: Heavy Equipment Management Program at Hocking College, Monday Creek Restoration Project, Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Little Cities of Black Diamonds .

"Wisconsin USDA Rural Development Public Information Officer in  Rural  Jan 04,   The time had come for a community to see what it has built when the Household Abuse Victims Emergency Network (HAVEN, Inc.) recently celebrated the grand opening of their new Domestic Abuse Shelter and Office Facility in the northern Wisconsin community of Merrill. The newly renovated building will provide improved confidentiality and security, more office space and better facilities for staff to meet with clients. The larger shelter includes six bedrooms with a total of 24 beds, more bathrooms, a large new kitchen designed for convenient use by multiple residents, better laundry facilities, and is handicapped accessible. There is also a large living and dining area for residents, a children’s play room and a teen room. The lower level includes a room which can be used for groups or meetings. Established in , HAVEN, Inc. works to support the needs of the community by providing services to children, families, and adults who have been affected by abuse, violence, or sexual assault. When first started, the group used members’ homes for temporary shelters for abuse victims. It bought its first shelter building in . As the need for services grew, it became evident that a new, larger shelter was needed. A convenient building, the former Lincoln County Land Services Building known as ""the Annex"" was vacant with no prospective buyer. With $65,000 in the building fund, the HAVEN Board of Directors made an offer to the County Board for the Annex building, well below the County’s asking price of $249,000. The sale was unanimously approved last February. Through a capital campaign, lead by volunteers, more than a half a million dollars was raised for the rehabilitation project. Community businesses and residents also donated materials, services, time, and furnishings to the new shelter. It was announced at the grand opening event that more than 2,800 volunteer hours were put towards the completion of the new facility. HAVEN, Inc. was also awarded a $100,000 USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Grant for the renovation project. Grant funds were used toward the purchase of furnishings and equipment for the new shelter building including an elevator, sprinkler system, fencing, plumbing fixtures, a new security system, updated phone system, parking lot resurfacing, landscaping and cabinetry.  Additional funding came from the Merrill Housing Authority, WHEDA, the Merrill Community Foundation, private donations and in the form of a cooperative loan provided by three Merrill banks.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

"Release & Contact Info  Fact Sheet  Release No. .21  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  On November 2, at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), the United States and United Arab Emirates officially launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) alongside 31 countries and over 48 non-government partners. In remarks at the World Leaders Summit, President Biden announced that the United States intends to mobilize $1 billion in investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years . Previewed at President Biden’s Leaders Summit on Climate in April, AIM for Climate is a pioneering initiative uniquely focused on increasing investment and enabling greater public-private and cross-sectoral partnerships, intended to both raise global climate ambition, and underpin transformative climate action in the agriculture sector in all countries. AIM for Climate has already begun to bear fruit, garnering an “early harvest” of $4 billion in increased investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years. AIM for Climate partners are mobilizing this investment to close the global investment gap in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Climate-smart agriculture is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, while adapting and building resilience to climate change and/or reducing/removing greenhouse gas emissions. AIM for Climate seeks to create incentives for, and mechanisms for maximizing the impact of, new investments toward an agriculture sector that is ready to face a changing climate. Government partners are providing the crucial foundation of AIM for Climate, through a wave of public investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Other sectors, including business, philanthropy, and other non-government partners are invited to build upon that foundation with “innovation sprints” – investments in specific, impactful, measurable, expedited efforts – or by providing critical knowledge for identifying investment gaps, challenges, and opportunities. AIM for Climate has three primary objectives:  Demonstrate collective commitment to significantly increase investment in agricultural innovation for climate-smart agriculture and food systems over five years ;  Support frameworks and structures to enable technical discussions and the promotion of expertise, knowledge, and priorities across international and national levels of innovation to amplify the impact of participants’ investments; and  Establish appropriate structures for exchanges between Ministers, chief scientists, and other stakeholders as key focal points and champions for cooperation on climate-related agricultural innovation, to engender greater co-creation and cooperation on shared research priorities. AIM for Climate focuses on increasing and accelerating investment in, and other support for, climate-smart agricultural innovation in the areas of:  Scientific breakthroughs via basic agricultural research through national-level government and academic research institutions;  Public and private applied research, including through support to international research centers, institutions, and laboratory networks; and  Development, demonstration, and deployment of practical, actionable, and innovative products, services, and knowledge to producers and other market participants, including through national agricultural research extension systems. AIM for Climate government partners announced at COP26 include:  Government Partners  Azerbaijan  Australia  Bahamas  Bangladesh  Brazil  Burkina Faso  Canada  Colombia  Denmark  Finland  Georgia  Ghana  Honduras  Hungary  Ireland  Japan  Kenya  Republic of Korea  Israel  Lithuania  Mexico  Morocco  New Zealand  Philippines  Romania  Singapore  Sweden  United States  United Arab Emirates  United Kingdom  Uruguay  Ukraine  Vietnam A full list of partners and more information on AIM for Climate is available at www.aimforclimate.org. Participation in AIM for Climate is voluntary. Joining AIM for Climate as a Government, Innovation Sprint, or Knowledge Partner does not imply​ endorsement of or partnership between the participants; rather it entails an intention to support the goal and objectives of AIM for Climate. For additional inquiries, please contact press@usda.gov or ClimateComms@state.gov. # USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.",**What strategies are being employed by the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) to mobilize investment and maximize impact in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation?**,"1. **Innovation sprints**: Encouraging business, philanthropy, and other non-government partners to invest in specific, impactful, measurable, expedited efforts. 2. **Public-private partnerships**: Leverage public investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation as a foundation for private sector involvement. 3. **Knowledge sharing**: Identifying investment gaps, challenges, and opportunities through critical knowledge and expertise.

"Public Affairs Specialist for USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 13,  For people suffering from addiction, the chances of recovery are oftentimes only as good as the care they receive. And for decades, the Boxwood Recovery Center in Culpeper, Virginia struggled to provide the high-quality care it was capable of, as it operated out of a deteriorating former roadside motel and restaurant. “Why would you walk into a depressing place when you're probably already in a bad place in your life because of your addiction?” said Kolapo Olarinde, a Program Manager at Boxwood Recovery Center. With a desire to improve the odds of recovery for people in need, Rappahannock Rapidan Community Services (RRCS), the parent nonprofit which operates Boxwood Recovery Center, asked the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development for help. Rural Development was able to help Boxwood with a $3.2 million loan through its Community Facilities Direct Loan & Grant program which provides affordable funding to develop essential community facilities in rural areas. The loan would allow the recovery center to build a state-of-the-art, 21,000 square-foot facility. Boxwood was finally going to have a center worthy of their cause. ""I don't think you can underestimate how important proper facilities are to keep people safe and in recovery,"" said RRCS Executive Director Jim LaGraffe. Today, the Boxwood Recovery Center continues to help many people on their recovery journeys by offering residential alcohol and drug treatment programs with individual, family, and group counseling, educational films, lectures, and relapse prevention.

There are at least 30,ates providing more than $700 billion to the economy. This year’s theme is Owning Our Identity, a reference to the principles and values that distinguish cooperatives from other business forms. Cooperatives are created by individuals to tackle issues they are unable to solve individually. Co-ops have additional features that make them an attractive option in today’s environment, including the ability to address social justice, create wealth in local communities, encourage self-determination, and build capacity in a community. But cooperatives do not guarantee business success and like other business models require planning and hard work. (View the top myths about cooperatives to learn more!) Cooperatives are made up of members who collectively own, operate, and run the organization, with each member typically getting one vote on decisions. Members are also the customers and use the cooperative services from agriculture marketing, food distribution, mutual purchasing, home care, childcare, real estate, to workers joining together to continue operating businesses that otherwise would have been closed or taken over by competitors. Cooperatives are resilient as evidenced by the fact that 23 percent of the country’s agricultural cooperatives have been in business 100 years or more, 54 percent have been operating for 75 years or more, and 77 percent have been in existence 50 years or more. To achieve such resilience and own their identity, cooperatives have shown they are ready and able to thrive in their communities through the upheavals and changes in the economy; from a pandemic to competition looking to overtake their sectors, and in members’ mindsets that evolve as new generations evolve how cooperatives are run. In celebration of National Cooperative Month, learn more about the resources available at Rural Development to help communities start, sustain, or convert to a cooperative business model:  Interagency Working Group on Cooperative Development: The Interagency Working Group for Cooperative Development, led by USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service, met five times in to uncover how cooperatives operate and benefit local people and communities in the housing, food, child care, real estate investment sectors.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Research, Education, and Economics in  Research and Science  Apr 22,  As we celebrate this Earth Day, we want to share a few examples of USDA’s commitment to climate-smart research and scientific investments. USDA science efforts focus on understanding the full range of potential climate impacts, developing science-based solutions, deploying strategies, conducting analyses, creating market opportunities using climate-smart production practices and developing innovative tools for farmers, ranchers and producers. USDA’s Climate Hubs develop and deliver valuable science-based information to agricultural producers and U.S. communities and the Hubs charged with advancing USDA efforts to promote climate-resilient landscapes and rural economic systems. It’s a unique collaboration across USDA and with partnering organizations that brings USDA research into practice. Earlier this year, USDA announced a $9 million investment in Climate Hubs partnerships with Cooperative Extension to bolster climate research and share climate-smart solutions directly with the agricultural community. Under this partnership, projects focus on building net-zero emissions in agriculture on working lands and in communities. USDA launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate — an international initiative that seeks to address climate change and global hunger by uniting participants to significantly increase investment in and support for climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. This effort is vital to protect our planet and enable solutions at the intersection of agriculture and climate. USDA also plays an important role in supporting clean energy. USDA joined the government-wide Sustainable Aviation Fuels Grand Challenge to enable scale-up of the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels to meet 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand by . USDA researchers are developing Earth-friendly agricultural feedstocks to support this effort.

"USDA Rural Development State Director for New York in  Rural  Apr 17,  I recently traveled to Torrey, New York to break ground on the town’s first-ever water district. This project has been more than 20 years in the making and it will improve the health and lives of people living in rural parts of the state. It will also improve the water quality and conservation efforts on the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The town received $2.4 million in funding through USDA Rural Development’s Water and Environmental Program (WEP). Once completed, this project will bring safe and reliable water to more than 40 households. I was joined by town and community leaders – both past and present – as well as the engineers from Clark Patterson Lee and Nardozzi construction teams who will be building out the new waterline. “The residents in this area have trouble with water from the lake or their wells are prone to dry out,” Town Supervisor Peter Martini said. “Some of the wells are inadequate for residential use. Once reliable wells are getting less reliable. If everything goes as planned, residents should have water from the new line by this summer.” As Earth Day approaches, projects like this one make me proud to invest in our planet and in rural America. It is an example of how USDA is partnering with rural communities to build critical infrastructure that will create jobs for people across the state and the nation. Every community needs access to modern water and wastewater systems – especially rural residents and businesses throughout New York state. USDA is proud to celebrate Earth Day to show how we are investing in locally driven solutions like this one in rural New York to expand access to safe water and reliable wastewater infrastructure, renewable energy and essential services that create jobs, build critical infrastructure and create sustainable futures for rural America.

"in Rural  Apr 19,  It’s a human right to have access to clean water and reliable wastewater systems. USDA Rural Development finances projects to build strong infrastructure to help people in rural America thrive and create economic opportunities. This week, as we celebrate Earth Day, we are proud to highlight some of the many ways USDA programs advance climate-smart infrastructure to help people have a more accessible, affordable and safe water supply. Water Independence Comes to a Rural Community in Missouri For six years, Public Water Supply District No. oddard County purchased water from a nearby community. USDA Rural Development awarded $2.6 million under the Water & Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program to make improvements to the district's drinking water production, storage and distribution system. This project is expected to enable the district to provide community members quality water from its own systems. The project will help the district drill two wells in areas with good water quality. That will help reduce operational costs because the water will require less treatment. The funds will also be used to install meters to reduce water loss and more accurately record the amount of water each customer uses. Wastewater System Upgrades Improve Health and Safety for People in Rural Tennessee The town of Baxter is improving the health and safety of the community’s residents. The town used a loan and grant totaling to $3 million through the Water and Waste Disposal Program Loan and Grant program to upgrade its wastewater treatment to provide safe and clean wastewater services to 1,350 people. The improvements will upgrade a sewer pump station and other infrastructure needs. Safe Drinking Water for Tribal and Underserved Rural Communities in Minnesota USDA Rural Development awarded the Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa Indians a loan and grant totaling to $8 million under the Water and Waste Disposal Program to make improvements to the Mahnomen community water system on the Fond du Lac Reservation in Carlton County. This project will replace two water wells, a water treatment plant and water distribution lines. The funds also will be used to build a water tank. These improvements will ensure that the Tribe’s water system is safe for the 620 residents it serves.

"Acting National Coordinator for USDA Climate Hubs, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy in  Climate  Farming  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 08,  In June , Secretary Vilsack outlined a vision for agricultural solutions to environmental challenges, which included creating the Regional Climate Hubs. In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests. Early career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. “Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said. “Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said. The Climate Hubs continue to build capacity to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.

"NIFA, Writer/Editor in  Research and Science  Apr 20,  Feeding a world population estimated to exceed 9 billion by will require significant increases in agricultural production, yet those increases must be sustainable solutions that protect the world’s natural resources. As USDA’s primary extramural funding agency, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invests in research, education and Extension efforts to ensure a secure food supply while protecting and enhancing the world’s natural resources. NIFA’s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) is the nation’s leading competitive grants program for agricultural sciences. AFRI-funded science is vital to meeting food, fiber and fuel demands as the global population expands while safeguarding the world’s land and water resources. NIFA is working to transform American agriculture to increase production in sustainable ways and doing so in the context of diminishing land and water resources and a changing climate. Examples of NIFA-Supported Research Advancing Climate-Smart Ag:  Researchers at Auburn University have identified two genes that appear to coordinate the fitness of plants in defending themselves from drought while also stimulating growth. The genes will likely be good candidates to help generate crops that are truly drought tolerant.  University of California scientists are developing new instruments and analysis techniques that will provide insights into the sources and chemistry of atmospheric aerosols and the role they play in global climate and regional air pollution.  Rutgers University showed that increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide could lead to changes in soil structure. Researchers are helping develop better crop fertilization and irrigation practices that maximize yields while minimizing soil and water contamination from excess nutrients.  A microclimate study conducted by West Virginia State University Extension Service is helping landowners learn more about climate change impact on regional weather, with the goal of minimizing negative impact on seasonal crops and overall farm livelihood.  At North Dakota State University, researchers developed web-based nitrogen calculators for more efficient nitrogen management without decreasing crop yields in crops like wheat, canola, barley and sugar beets. NIFA and the projects it supports are crucial to feeding the world and protecting the Earth for future generations.

"Chief Officer, OCIO Enterprise Management Center (EDMC) in  Technology  Apr 22,  The USDA recently wrapped up a successful hackathon at Colorado State University. This event, which brought together computer science and science students around a real USDA challenge, is a prime example of the many benefits that hackathons can offer. But what exactly is a hackathon, and why are they so beneficial? A hackathon is an intensive event where participants collaborate to create solutions to specific problems. The fast-paced environment of a hackathon encourages creativity, innovation, and teamwork. By bringing together people from different backgrounds and disciplines, hackathons can foster cross-pollination of ideas and lead to the development of solutions that might not have been possible otherwise. From April 4-6, representatives from USDA joined CSU at the downtown Fort Collins, CO campus, bringing together staff from USDA-OCIO, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), CSU’s Computer Sciences and Animal Sciences programs, and the Ram Hack student organization to conduct the 24-hour hackathon. USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small provided pre-recorded remarks, and the USDA Chief and AI Officer Christopher Alvares kicked off the event. Our event with CSU was developed around a real-world artificial intelligence use case for AMS. AMS is pursuing ways to expand their meat grading service and want to explore the use of image processing and artificial intelligence. Over 60 CSU students across 18 teams were challenged to develop predictive models that could accurately estimate beef grade (e.g. Prime, Choice, Select) and fat thickness using images of beef ribeye's as they would appear to an AMS meat grader. Representatives from USDA provided technical assistance to many of the hackathon’s participants. Six teams were recognized for their accomplishments and will also receive letters of appreciation and an opportunity to meet with AMS on their project. Prior to the start of the hackathon, a career fair was held with representatives from OCIO’s Office of the Chief Officer, Cybersecurity and Privacy Operations Center, Client Experience Center, and Digital Infrastructure Services Center. Representatives discussed core professional skills, resume tips, and internship opportunities at USDA. Students also heard about programs such as the US Digital Corps, GSA’s two-year tech fellowship program and a partner of USDA. We hope to strengthen relationships with CSU and other universities to not only help address real USDA problems, but also inspire students and learners through hackathon events to hone their skills and consider a tech career in USDA and public service.

"Expanding Affordable Healthcare in Rural South Carolina  Having access to quality health care is often a problem for low-income patients who live in rural communities. Fortunately, there are medical facilities such as Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc in Lugoff, South Carolina that work on a sliding fee scale, which means that all their patients, regardless of income level, can afford quality health care. However, this has also increased their number of patients over time, and it wasn’t long before they recognized that their Lugoff office was running out of space.  Stephanie Bittiker, USDA Rural Development Public Information Officer  Posted in  Equity  Rural  Sep 16,   Respond to this story",How have expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical increased patient care demands?,"The expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc. have led to an increase in their patient volume, resulting in space constraints at their Lugoff office."
"of Agriculture Xochitl Torres Small in  Equity  Aug 01,  Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has advanced equity by listening to the people we serve and learning how we can serve them better by removing barriers to our programs and services. USDA offices and agencies have developed key actions to comprehensively incorporate equity into the Department’s services, which touch every American’s life. USDA Rural Development’s Equity Action Plan was one of the last projects I worked on as Under Secretary of that mission area. So I know firsthand how hard USDA staff have worked to make change. Now in my new role as Deputy Secretary, I am thrilled to share the release of 14 Equity Action Plans that encompass the work across all of USDA. These plans follow the lead of President Biden’s Executive Order 1, which insists that federal agencies use all the policy levers we have to make progress. Founded on the insight that our country is stronger when everyone participates, and more vulnerable when people are left out, the plans released today are part of our relentless focus to shape USDA to truly be what President Lincoln called us, the People’s Department. While the plans are ambitious, I know they are achievable. The plans share both accomplishments and actions underway. A few examples of the accomplishments include:  Simplified direct farm loan application processes. The Farm Service Agency drastically reduced the burden and time necessary for farmers and ranchers applying for loans. FSA has also rolled out a loan assistance tool that helps farmers and ranchers better navigate the farm loan application process.  Regional Food Business Centers. A dozen Food Business Centers will support a more resilient, diverse, and competitive food system. These Centers—led by partners who include the Mississippi Delta Council for Farmworker Opportunities, the Georgia Minority Outreach Network, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council—will support producers by providing localized assistance to access local and regional supply chains, including linking producers to wholesalers and distributors.  Rural Partners Network – The Rural Partners Network (RPN) is an alliance of federal agencies and commissions, led by USDA Rural Development, working directly with rural communities to expand rural prosperity through job creation, infrastructure development, and community improvement.  Embracing Tribal Sovereignty. The Forest Service has embraced Tribal self-determination principles, releasing the USDA Forest Service Action Plan: Strengthening Tribal Consultations and Nation-to-Nation Relationships, and furthering co-stewardship agreements.  Microfarms at RMA — The Risk Management Agency (RMA) issued a Micro Farm policy to provide additional insurance options for small-scale producers. The policy development process included obtaining feedback from small-scale producers that have grown products for their local communities. But of course there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Some of our plans include:  Increasing access to nutrition programs. FNS will support State and local partnerships to increase the reach of nutrition programs in underserved communities and will continue to expand online shopping. And it will move forward on nationwide implementation of the new Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer program, which will provide grocery-buying benefits to low-income families with school-aged children when schools are closed for the summer.  Expanding Urban and Community Forestry Benefits. The Forest Service will increase access to urban forestry benefits.  Improving Civil Rights processes. USDA's civil rights office will continue to improve civil rights complaint processes; it will eliminate complaint backlogs, meet ambitious timeliness goals going forward, and implement a fast-track emergency intervention program complaint process to allow timely solutions in cases that involve urgent needs.  Enhancing capacity of minority-serving institutions. Research, Education, and Economics will increase stakeholder engagement to identify research needs, enhance research collaboration, offer new grant programs, and invest in facilities and workforce development to help build capacity.

"Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19?  Last year, as COVID-19 rattled the world economy and disrupted trade flows, agricultural trade remained mostly stable, falling only two percent during the initial wave of infections and lockdowns, before bouncing back and ending the year up 3.5 percent. But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.

"USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Climate  Farming  Technology  Trade  Aug 09,  Accurate crop mapping is a crucial process to informing reliable crop production estimates, addressing climate change, and developing strategies for sustainable agriculture. U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service is working with university students in Tanzania on a pilot project to gather grassroots to strengthen community agricultural systems and improve crop condition assessments with satellite imagery. Their field work is adding truth from the ground up to the sky. In April, 14 YouthMappers spent four days in the Arusha area capturing on 334 fields by photographing, georeferencing, and identifying target crops to enhance FAS satellite imagery analysis. YouthMappers is an international network of university-based chapters that organize and implement mapping activities in response to global and local development needs. “The YouthMappers’ chapters are products under USAID, which empower youth to help their community,” said Gideon G. Sway, one of the Tanzania YouthMappers. The FAS-YouthMappers team’s main objective was to create an agricultural library of ground-truth from the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. This activity is the first time YouthMappers has used its members’ skills to strengthen agricultural . While Tanzania grows several kinds of crops, making this a viable machine learning project the team to focus on locating target crops of FAS’ International Production Assessment Division (IPAD). Oftentimes, crops are grown together in larger fields and can be detectable by freely available satellite imagery. In addition to geo-locating these crops, the team’s field work revealed variability in crop heights and exposed pest damage—especially from the fall army worm. This future-facing project improves understanding of crop conditions and the impact of seasonal rains. Since the project began, the Tanzanian YouthMappers network has collected from 1,700 fields in the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. Thanks to YouthMappers, FAS can now pair satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 with the field . In May, these YouthMappers, trained additional university students on geo-mapping with ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, and Kobo Collect to help advance Tanzanian agriculture and achieve project goals for the Dodoma and Mwanza regions. The Tanzania partnership is part of FAS efforts to help develop young agricultural leaders to strengthen Africa’s self-development and capacity building. Be on the lookout for this group’s presentation next month at the Africa Food Systems Forum. The goal of the Forum is for public, private, and non-profit groups to strengthen African agricultural and food systems via inclusivity, sustainability, resiliency, and equity.

"The Electronic Government Act of was signed into law on December 17, . ""Electronic Government""(E-GOV) is defined as the Government use of ""web-based Internet applications or other information technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government information and services to the public, other agencies, and other Government entities; or to bring about improvements in Government operations that may include effectiveness, efficiency, service quality, or transformation."" The E-Government Act of established a new agency within the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Electronic Government, which is responsible for electronic information management and for promoting interagency cooperation to improve public services. The act creates a Chief Information Council that works with other Federal agencies and State and local governments to help develop electronic technology policies, requirements, and strategies. An E-Government Fund was also established to provide funding for projects intended to allow for easier public access to information, improved government services and transactions, and enhanced agency information technology project coordination and planning. The E-GOV initiatives serve citizens, businesses, and Federal and state government employees by delivering high quality services more efficiently at a lower price. Instead of expensive “stove piped” operations, agencies work together to develop common solutions which achieve mission requirements at reduced cost, thereby making resources available for higher priority needs. USDA currently participates in 14 Presidential E-GOV Initiatives and Lines of Business (LoB).  By participating in the E-GOV Initiatives and LoBs, USDA has improved its business processes and program delivery to its customers, employees, and partners.  Through these efforts, USDA has been able to work with other Federal agencies to streamline common areas of business delivery (e.g. rulemaking, payroll, and grants management) and learn from best practices throughout the government.  The Department will continue to implement these Initiatives and LoBs to achieve further benefits for its customers. The OCIO E-GOV Office serves as USDA’s focal point for E-GOV Presidential Initiatives and Lines of Business, as well as the USDA liaison to the Office of Management and Budget regarding E-GOV. The office provides oversight and guidance to the development and implementation of USDA-wide policies, standards, and procedures for E-GOV implementations. The office manages USDA’s E-GOV relationships with other Federal agencies. It identifies and promotes common enterprise solutions to enable improvements in USDA’s business, information, and technology infrastructures to reduce overall funding requirements.  It also provides leadership in addressing and resolving IT department-wide issues and obstacles to achieving E-GOV objectives.","What is the primary goal of the Electronic Government Act's Office of Electronic Government in promoting interagency cooperation, implementing initiatives, and making resources available across government agencies?","The primary goal of the Electronic Government Act's Office of Electronic Government is to improve public services, make resources available for higher priority needs, and reduce costs by enabling agencies to work together to develop common solutions."

"Information Technology (IT) plays a critical role in the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) ability to carry out its mission to “…provide leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management.” Each year the complexity of the IT environment grows, and making sound IT investment decisions requires greater amounts of information. For example, the Department improves the Nation’s economy and quality of life by touching the lives of almost every person in America, every day. Nearly 100,000 employees deliver more than $144 billion in public services through the Department’s more than 300 programs worldwide, providing leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management. USDA needs to respond effectively to the challenges posed by the diversity, complexity, and volume of IT investment proposals brought forward by various stakeholders throughout the Department. This new integrated IT governance framework supports government priorities and program delivery. USDA’s Integrated Information Technology Governance Framework (IITGF) is a holistic set of processes, procedures, and that assist the Office of the Chief Information Officer’s (OCIO’s) customers improve mission delivery. It does this by providing structure around the budget formulation, budget execution, enterprise architecture, capital planning, IT security, Section 508, Records Management, and portfolio/project management processes. Implementing the IITGF satisfies the following goals:  Provides a coherent and effective project management methodology to guide IT project management at USDA. The methodology is intended to consistently deliver IT capabilities that provide maximum support to USDA business needs within approved cost and schedule constraints.  Better integrates IT project planning and execution with IT Governance, including more effective multi-disciplinary reviews of IT projects by the stakeholders and IT executive governance bodies. The IITGF includes touch points with other USDA’s governance, management, and control activities and processes, such as: Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC), Agriculture’s System Development Life Cycle (AgSDLC) approach, Project Management (PM), Enterprise Architecture (EA), Risk Management Framework (RMF), and IT Security. Implementing an Integrated IT Governance Framework further supports the USDA mission by providing the alignment for decisions with needed technology components, services, and applications. An important objective of the IITGF Life Cycle is to provide flexibility that allows for tailoring of artifacts, decision gate reviews, and governance board reviews to suit the characteristics of a particular solution development effort. If tailoring is approved in advance by the governance board, these alternative development approaches empower project managers to tailor tasks in order to meet the specific needs of the project while maintaining compliance with the AgSDLC and IITGF governance processes. Some of the most popular, time and cost effective alternative development models are: Rapid Application Development (RAD), Pilot Development, Iterative, Agile, Government off the Shelf (GOTS)/Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

"Who Are We? The Enterprise Architecture Division provides a planning concept and delivery process designed to help translate business strategies into mission results. We leverage as a strategic asset so that architecture becomes a tool to make -driven decisions that optimize resources, identify duplication, and cost saving opportunities. The EAD team supports the creation of an integrated, tiered Enterprise Architecture (EA) that supports improved planning and risk management at both the agency and Department levels. Additionally, the team supports standardization on common computing platforms to enhance interoperability and reduce cost of ownership; and improving the USDA’s planning and decision-making by more closely aligning EA activities to the IT Capital Planning processes. EAD provides and maintains for USDA a centralized EAVE (Enterprise Architecture Visioning Environment) that aligns IT assets to the Federal Enterprise Architecture reference models. Through its collection and reporting capabilities, the EAVE enables organizations to better identify collaboration, modernization and transformation opportunities. The EAD reinforces the adoption and documentation of technical standards, making it easier for USDA agencies to realize economies-of-scale cost savings based on aggregated purchases of like products and services. Additionally, the EA helps USDA identify opportunities for business reuse and sharing of existing infrastructure and services, reducing operational and overhead costs. What Do We Do? Enterprise Architecture gives the Department a bird’s eye view of the whole organization – and the ecosystem in which it operates both at a high level and detailed level as it matures overtime. EA is unique from other disciplines within the IT Management Framework in that it:  Encompasses the whole mission and operational scope of the Department  Represents the Department’s ecosystem at a high level of detail  Is based on a metamodel comprised of modular components making it reusable across the practice area in a wide range of scenarios Enterprise Architecture informs and translates strategies and business model changes into a set of coordinated actions needed to make them real via a roadmap. It has a special role between IT Strategy and IT Execution. Consider it a bridge between the two as it defines priorities and scope for translating strategy into operational reality.  Enabling an Actionable Architecture - Supports Agencies in making informed decisions concerning technology investments by implementing an “actionable architecture” which takes enterprise architecture from being a goal and moves it to becoming a platform for decision support. Actionable architecture brings architecture to the forefront as a way to centralize and visualize relationships among systems, people, processes and to make smarter decisions.

"Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) is a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating information technology investments. Optimizing the Performance of IT Investments Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) is a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating information technology investments. CPIC is mandated by the Clinger Cohen Act of which requires federal agencies to focus on the results produced by IT investments. Here’s how we guide our clients through the CPIC lifecycle: Pre-Select Phase—Executive decision-makers assess each proposed investment’s support of USDA’s strategic and mission needs. Project managers compile the information necessary for supporting a detailed investment proposal. Select Phase—Investment analyses are conducted and the members of the E-Board choose the IT projects that best support USDA’s mission and enterprise architecture. Control Phase—USDA ensures, through timely oversight, quality control, and executive review, that IT investments are executed or developed in a disciplined, well-managed, and consistent manner. Evaluate Phase—Actual results of the implemented projects are compared to planned results to assess investment performance. Once investments are implemented, actual versus expected results are evaluated to: assess the investment's impact on strategic performance; identify any changes or modifications to the investment that may be needed; and revise the investment management processes based on lessons learned, self-assessments and benchmarking.

"Communications Director, USDA Rural Development, Tennessee in  Energy  Rural  Feb 01,   USDA Business and Cooperative Programs Administrator Judith Canales convened a roundtable of renewable energy experts from the southeast in Nashville on January 26, to discuss development and marketing of bioenergy technologies and advanced biofuels. Despite an unexpected snow the night before, participants traveled in from Memphis and Knoxville as well as Middle Tennessee. FSA and Rural Development State Directors Gene Davidson and Bobby Goode hosted the Administrator and Ed Harlan of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Louis Buck of Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative, Pete Nelson of Memphis Bioworks, Atha Comiskey and Bart Comiskey of Clean Cities of Middle Tennessee, Paul Melgaard of Eco Energy, Terry Ruse of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Warren Nevad of the Tennessee Renewable Energy Economic Council, Dan Stasser of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Stan Boyd and David Owenby of the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Rural Development Tennessee Energy Programs Coordinator Will Dodson. Canales opened the forum with the idea that, ""By making renewable energy sources commercially viable based on feed stock available in each region of the country, we create sustainable opportunities for job creation and economic development, and keep more energy dollars in the community."" The spirited discussion covered a range of challenges on the horizon for the emerging bioenergy industry from traditional fuel providers to misperceptions about the tradeoff between food and fuel crops. Canales emphasized that changes are coming to the USDA energy programs that will allow applications to be submitted year round and to encourage geographic and technological diversity. Canales and others brought up the regional nature of biofuel production. Regionally significant feed stocks mentioned included cellulosic switch grass, wood pulp and sucrose-rich crops. With the commercial availability of existing flex fuels growing rapidly, participants called for a fresh examination of regulations intended to encourage their use. ""Greater use helps drive down production costs and will encourage more stations to carry fuels like E20, E30 and E85 as they come online,"" said Goode. ""We can help drive the change to cleaner fuels by doing more to take advantage of flex fuels in fleet vehicles and by educating consumers on the benefits of using more renewable American-made energy resources."" Coop Manager Louis Buck said that with the advances being made in bioenergy production today he looks forward to a time when farmers send power down wires to the city and get a check delivered back in the mail. Electronic mail, presumably. During the roundtable, Canales also announced the award of a $25,000 Rural Energy for America (REAP) grant to the Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative. According to Buck, ""The investment will be used for research into commercializing a new, more efficient technology for generating hydrogen from what is typically regarded as low-potential biomass feed stock.""

There was excitement in Jefferson City, Missouri’s State Capitol, when Judith Canales, Administrator for USDA Rural Development Rural Business-Cooperative Programs kicked off  Rural Development’s  Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) workshop on flex-fuel options.  Canales informed the 45 people in attendance that grants are available to provide fuel station owners with incentives to install flexible fuel pumps that will offer Americans more renewable energy options. Pictured left to right: John Eggleston, Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Bradley Schad, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Judith Canales, USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service Administrator; Matt Amick, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Gary Wheeler, Missouri Corn Growers Association; and Janie Dunning, USDA Rural Development Missouri State Director The event was hosted by the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives and their Secretary/Treasurer, John Eggleston, (also a 30-year pioneer of the ethanol industry in Missouri).  He  emphasized the importance of ethanol as a renewable energy source in reducing America’s dependency on foreign oil. Matt Moore, Director Business Programs for Missouri Rural Development (RD), illustrated that the REAP incentives offer options for financing the conversion of fuel stations pumps or installation of new flex fuel pumps resulting in a choice for Missourians when purchasing fuel in the future. The REAP incentives can be coupled with $5,000 incentives offered from both Growth Energy and the Missouri Corn Growers Association according to Bradley Schad, Director of Ethanol Blends with the Missouri Corn Growers Association. Other stakeholders in attendance that provided comments in support of the renewable energy programs included: Loyd Wilson, Division Director for Missouri Department of Agriculture; J.P. Dunn, Missouri Soybean Association;   Tom May,  Marketing Director for MFA Oil Company;  retailers, flex fuel pump distributors and others. As a highlight, the Missouri Corn Growers brought to the meeting a flex fuel pump for all the attendees and media to see. During the Question and Answer session of the meeting, it was pointed out that a small convenience store chain was exploring the possibility of putting new fuel dispensers in at several of their locations. Canales summed up the day by saying, “I want to make certain that everyone is aware of the variety of assistance USDA Rural Development provides to help businesses create jobs and become energy more efficient. This assistance builds on the Obama Administration’s commitment to ‘Win the Future’ by ensuring the Nation develops innovative ways to meet our future energy needs.” Administrator Canales explains the provisions of USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program during an appearance in Missouri  Category/Topic:  Energy  Rural  Tags:  Energy  Jefferson City  Judith Canales  Matt Moore  Missouri  REAP  Renewable Energy  Rural Development","**What funding sources and incentives are available for fuel station owners to install flexible fuel pumps in Missouri, as part of the USDA's Rural Energy for America Program (REAP)?**","* Grants from the USDA's Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) * $5,000 incentives offered by both Growth Energy and the Missouri Corn Growers Association."

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Conservation  Feb 24,  Red-backed salamanders and other amphibians are key players in ecosystem health. (iStock photo) Forested areas that border wetlands help protect wildlife, but until recently their efficacy has been untested for most amphibian species.  Now, recently published results of a six-year study explore how the loss or reduction of amphibians could affect the ecosystem. At the University of New Hampshire, Dr. Kimberly Babbitt and a team of graduate students conducted landscape-scale experiments that tested the impacts of forest buffer width vernal pools on population size and structure, body size and condition and population genetics of two amphibian species in the northeastern United States. A grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supported the project. The investigation examined the response of spotted salamanders and wood frogs in three environments: wetlands surrounded by either intact forest, a 30-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut, and a 100-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut. The study indicates that areas with smaller buffers had negative impact on size and condition of salamanders and frogs. Analysis of genetic relatedness indicated that, despite logging, populations across the broader landscape are well-connected. Babbitt and doctoral student Danial Hocking also examined the role of amphibians in forest floor ecosystem function and conducted a review of amphibian contribution to ecosystem services. “We found that amphibians contribute in a variety of ways to human societies,” Babbitt said.  “We are examining the roles in different forest types to understand under what context salamanders can influence ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth.” Some of the beneficial effects of amphibians on the ecosystem are known, such as the ability of tadpoles reduce eutrophication (greening) by consuming excess algae.  In many ecosystems means that amphibians have important roles both as food sources and as predators – amphibians feed heavily on mosquitoes, making them an important line of defense against mosquito-borne diseases, including the West Nile virus.  Babbitt noted many that amphibians have a lot more to offer – if we can ensure their survival. “Although yet to result in approved pharmaceuticals, amphibian skin secretions have shown the ability to inhibit HIV transmission and provide stronger analgesic effects than opioids,” she said. “Learning from these chemical secretions could lead to breakthroughs in human medicine. However, amphibians are declining across the globe and species are going extinct. It’s important to protect species before potential advances are lost.” NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.  Greater understanding of how forest buffers can protect the amphibians that serve the ecosystem is important knowledge that will help states, communities, and landowners make more informed decisions about land use and management, Babbitt said.

"USDA Public Information Coordinator, Virginia in  Rural  Aug 10,  USDA officials and residents of Carroll County gather in front of emergency equipment and transportation equipment purchased with USDA support. Under bright, sunny skies last Friday, hundreds of residents of Carroll County, Virginia turned out to acknowledge the support provided by USDA Rural Development. Working in conjunction with State and local governments, non-profit entities and the business community, USDA has infused well over $80 million into the area in recent years, and half of that was to improve water quality. Carroll County is located in the Southwest portion of the state, and the county seat, Hillsville, is surrounded by the Blue Ridge Mountains. USDA officials on hand for the celebration included Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook and Virginia State Director Ellen Davis. Both toured facilities that Rural Development helped finance, including a retraining center, court house and a public exercise facility.  In late morning, the USDA officials were the guests of honor at a luncheon at the regional farmers market that was attended by an estimated 500 guests.  Speaking to the audience, Congressman Rick Boucher praised Cook and Davis, along with Rural Development staff and acknowledged the efforts of Travis Jackson, a longtime USDA employee and regional Rural Development representative. The Congressman called Jackson “A premier public servant…enormously effective,” and praised Jackson for his work with local residents to complete funding application processes.  Congressman Boucher also thanked the County Supervisors who “Have a vision of what rural America can be.” During the luncheon, Board Chairman Wesley Hurst joined his colleagues and representatives of the school board in presenting Ms. Cook and Ms. Davis with plaques making them “Honorary County Residents.” Afterward, the guests lined up for a photo in front of emergency response and public transportation equipment funded through Rural Development’s Community Facilities Program. Ms. Cook, who served as a Rural Development state director prior to her appointment as deputy under secretary, said she had never seen an event as amazing as the one organized by the people of Carroll County.  Afterward Cook toured the farmers market and spoke to local producers.  Deputy Rural Development Under Secretary Cheryl Cook Addresses members of the county board, school board and hundreds of members of the public during a luncheon.

"USDA Rural Development Public Information Office in  Rural  Sep 09,   “Small towns and rural communities need assistance from USDA Rural Development, now more than ever.” That was the consensus of attendees participating in a breakout session at the National Association of Towns and Townships (NATaT) annual meeting in Washington in early September. During and after the session Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Cheryl Cook heard accounts of how local Rural Development staff have made a difference in the economic health of rural communities in states including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Many described the positive impact of investments made through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act over the last two years, but expressed concern for the future. Water systems, broadband access, and fire and rescue capabilities were frequently cited as critical foundational investments every community needs. But many said finding private partners willing to lend on affordable terms is a challenge for smaller communities that have a limited tax base. A number of elected officials said that increasing the availability of private capital for existing and start-up businesses, improving educational and healthcare opportunities, and helping develop renewable energy options were all key to strengthening local economies through diversification. Many also praised the local knowledge and accessibility of RD’s network of staff members who regularly visit nearly every county in the nation. “Most of us have full time day-jobs and serve our communities as best we can,” explained one local leader from northeast Pennsylvania. “Without the technical assistance from our regional Rural Development Office I doubt we could get through the application process successfully. And that’s assuming we could even keep track of when funding is available for the infrastructure our town needs.” Cook described Rural Development as, “Three agencies on a mission, using loans, loan-guarantees and leveraging grants,” to make it affordable for small towns to keep up with advances in technology, provide necessary infrastructure, and to attract the pool of business investment capitol often taken for granted in larger cities. “One of the great things at Rural Development is that we make it affordable for rural communities to help themselves,” she said. “And by being hands-on from the start, we set them up for success.” According to Cook that means nearly all the investments RD makes get paid back with interest. “So, even as budgets get tighter, the capacity of our community facilities programs is able to grow to meet the needs of the many small towns struggling to survive.” “We want to Rural America to do more than just get by; we want these communities to thrive as the American economy recovers,” said cook.

"Rural Development State Director, New Jersey in  Initiatives  Rural  Oct 29,   After struggling for several years with a stagnant economy, the future is looking brighter for Paulsboro, New Jersey.  Earlier this week, USDA Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook, Assistant Administrator for the Water and Environmental Program Jacki Ponti, and I attended an event to celebrate a Recovery Act-funded water project that will help to stimulate job creation while also upgrading Paulsboro’s water system. The diverse borough of Paulsboro houses just over 6,000 residents and faces many of the same challenges of rural towns across the country.  In recent years, the decreasing demand for fuel spurred a number of oil refinery layoffs, displacing hundreds of Paulsboro workers and contributing to a steady rate of out-migration. In addition to the poor economic conditions in Paulsboro, the continuous repair of the public water system, much of which was built in the ’s, was becoming unfeasible, so the Borough worked with RD’s Water and Waste Disposal program to obtain financing for the water system improvements. “We’ve done over $20 billion in investments under the Recovery Act, with over $134 million of that right here in New Jersey,” said Deputy Under Secretary Cook.  “This is an investment that will yield dividends many years into the future for the residents of Paulsboro.” A Recovery Act loan-grant combination of $4.3 million will allow for the construction of two new water supply wells and a new water treatment plant.  These upgrades will remove aluminum, iron, manganese, benzene, and radium contaminants from the raw water, so Paulsboro residents will enjoy clean drinking water. In addition, these water system upgrades will facilitate greater economic development along the Port of Paulsboro.  New Jersey’s Governor recently traveled to the Port of Paulsboro to announce an off-shore wind energy generation initiative, which involves the employment of Paulsboro residents in receiving and assembling wind turbines at the Port.  This renewable energy initiative has the potential to create thousands of permanent jobs in the area. This is an exciting time for the borough of Paulsboro, and I am thrilled Rural Development, through Recovery Act funding, can contribute to this great project.  The jobs to be created in the construction of the new water system will serve to invigorate the Paulsboro economy now, but the upgraded system will allow for continued economic growth into the future.

"Michigan Rural Development Public Information Officer in  Rural  Jun 04,   Last week, USDA Rural Development in Michigan got an early start on Homeownership Month by promoting a pilot refinancing program, announced in February by Secretary Tom Vilsack, to help residents with current USDA home loans reduce their payments. Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Doug O’Brien and USDA Rural Development State Director for Michigan James Turner made the announcement at the Portage office of AmeriFirst Home Mortgage, a leading partner with USDA’s Guaranteed Home Loan program. AmeriFirst agreed to participate in the pilot refinance initiative and eight of the first 26 loans were with their customers. “Since the creation of the USDA Guaranteed Home Loan program, USDA has helped more than 54,000 rural Michigan residents purchase houses,” O’Brien said.  “This pilot refinancing initiative helps people keep their homes and avoid financial hardship. I encourage any USDA homeowner who is eligible to explore this simplified refinancing program.” Existing Rural Development borrowers eligible for the pilot refinance program are not to obtain new appraisals, property inspections or credit .  The new interest rate for the refinance must be a fixed rate at least 1 percentage point below the current interest rate. The term cannot exceed 30 years.  No cash-out is permitted to the borrower. Complete details concerning eligibility are available at any USDA Rural Development office. Homeowners who meet these criteria may refinance their Rural Development guaranteed loans regardless of the loan-to-value ratio for the property. This enables borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth to get lower interest rates and reduce their monthly mortgage payments. “The pilot program can help stabilize neighborhoods and prevent the disruption and loss caused by home foreclosures,” Turner said.  “The goal is to help residents keep their homes and meet their obligations by giving them some financial breathing room.” After the Portage event, Deputy Under Secretary O’Brien went to Edwardsburg, on the Indiana state line, where he toured a glycerine-refining facility owned by CRB Real Estate LLC.  The company received two Business and Industry Guaranteed Loans for the purchase of real estate and the building and funding to finance the purchase of machinery and equipment.  Funding was through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

"Vermont/New Hampshire USDA Rural Development state director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 12,  USDA Rural Development’s Business and Loan Guarantee Program supported new construction for an expanded Brattleboro Food Coop in Brattleboro, Vermont. The original plan for two stories was expanded to four thanks to an innovative partnership with the Windsor Housing Trust to develop mixed-income apartments. “Smart Growth” is a term we hear more and more often.  It is the idea that as communities plan for the future, they consider the highest and best use of every resource – land, infrastructure, organizations and people.    From housing to transportation to energy to food; community developers and planners are asking how Smart Growth principles can be applied to ensure a sustainable and dynamic future for their communities and their residents. How is USDA involved in these efforts? Consider Brattleboro, Vermont.  With a population of 12,000, Brattleboro sits on the state’s southeastern border, and is a vibrant mix of industry, art and education.    Brattleboro’s downtown district was one of the first communities to take advantage of Vermont’s Downtown Program giving it access to state tax credits and shining a spotlight on its rich history. Its vibrant downtown is an inviting mix of shops, restaurants, offices and an art deco theatre and hotel.    Anchoring one end of the downtown is the Brattleboro Food Coop. Founded in , the Brattleboro Food Coop started as a local buying club.  It eventually grew into a popular retail destination featuring a wide range of products from nearby farms in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.  By , the Brattleboro Coop was outgrowing its space.  It considered moving to a new location outside of downtown.  The Board of the Coop, however, decided that its mission was much more compatible with a Smart Growth solution to its expansion needs.    In the meantime, the Windham and Windsor Housing Trust (WWHT) and Housing Vermont, were looking for a solution to Brattleboro’s need for more mixed income housing that was easily accessible to downtown’s services and amenities. With support from a loan guarantee from USDA’s Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program, the Brattleboro Coop remained downtown in a new, highly energy efficient building with expanded retail space.  The new Coop space was originally envisioned as a two story building.   Through innovative partnerships, an additional two stories on the new building were sold to WWHT and Housing Vermont.   Though the Coop and the housing complex have separate ownership, they have similar commitment to the sustainable future of Brattleboro. The Brattleboro Coop is featured in the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass for its dedication to local food and local communities. It recently received a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its commitment to Smart Growth principles.  The results are stunning.  The new Brattleboro Coop Building opened in June, . It now boasts over 14,000 square feet of retail space, supporting up to 100 jobs.  Over 60 percent of the products come from nearby farms.  The building also hosts a commissary kitchen and classrooms for cooking classes.   24 beautiful, energy efficient, mixed income apartments in the heart of downtown Brattleboro occupy two stories above the Coop. Recently, the Brattleboro Coop won a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These awards, which began in , recognize exceptional approaches to development that respect the environment, foster economic vitality, enhance quality of life, and provide new opportunities for disadvantaged communities. “The new Cooperative Building incorporates money-saving and innovative environmental features while fitting with the character of a traditional walkable New England town” noted the EPA. “Community members were the true champions of this project, insisting on a downtown location for their co-op that integrates both the grocery store and mixed-income housing”. The Brattleboro Coop is profiled in the Know Your Farmer Know Your Food Compass as an example of how local food systems can anchor community development and planning.  You can find other examples of how the Federal Government is supporting local food’s role in communities across the country on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass Map.

"Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announces $4.7 million in additional investment for rural small businesses  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .13  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, June 17, – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today kicked off National Small Business Week by highlighting USDA's actions to help rural small businesses create jobs, get access to capital and spur economic growth. He also announced the selection of recipients for USDA's Rural Business Enterprise Grants. USDA remains focused on carrying out its mission, despite a time of significant budget uncertainty.""Small businesses are the backbone of the economy in small towns and rural communities, just as they are in our biggest cities,"" Vilsack said. ""USDA supports small businesses by providing job training, business development opportunities, strategic community planning and other resources. We're focused on making sure that Main Street businesses have the tools they need to grow.""Secretary Vilsack announced 54 awards under the Rural Business Enterprise Grants program in 21 states – Alaska, Arizona, California, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Please click here for a complete list of Rural Business Enterprise Grants awarded today.USDA has several initiatives underway to support small businesses and the communities they serve. Altogether, USDA business and cooperative development programs have had a significant impact on rural communities – achieving record results under President Obama. Since , USDA has provided more than 15,000 loans and grants through its business programs, helping more than 60,000 rural small businesses. For more information on USDA's business and cooperative development programs, visit assistance has also been directed toward historically underserved communities. For example, USDA Rural Development is working closely with the Appalachian Regional Commission on a public/private partnership to help economies prosper. This partnership is intended to create a stronger and more diversified Appalachian economy. It compliments several other initiatives USDA has in place. Additionally, USDA is working in persistent poverty areas in rikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity.Rural small businesses are encouraged to contact their nearest USDA Rural Development office for information about available assistance. A list of these offices is available at funding announced today under the Rural Business Enterprise Grants program will help support the Obama Administration's vision by providing rural communities with resources to support small businesses, improve public facilities, and create new, sustainable jobs. Funding is contingent upon the recipient meeting the conditions for the grant.The Rural Business Enterprise Grant program also supports the development of local food systems. For example, in , the Dutchess County Economic Development Corporation (EDC) in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., received a $35,000 Rural Business Enterprise Grant to support the county's Farm Fresh program. It is designed to enhance agri-tourisim. As a result, EDC provides transportation for more than 2,300 visitors from metropolitan areas to small farms and vineyards throughout rural New York. The funding has increased tourism in rural New York and expanded markets for several small businesses.Rural Business Enterprise Grants and other USDA programs help rural small businesses manufacture new products, expand local food systems and create jobs. Secretary Vilsack continued a call this week for Congress to pass a comprehensive, multiyear Food, Farm and Jobs Bill as soon as possible. Leaders from both parties have signaled a willingness to come together and get this critically important legislation passed. On June 10, , the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan version of a Food, Farm and Jobs Bill. Secretary Vilsack noted that he is encouraged by signs that the House of Representatives will consider a bill this week.President Obama's plan to revitalize the rural economy has brought about historic investment over the past four years – including in America's small towns and rural communities. USDA, through its Rural Development mission area, has a portfolio of programs designed to improve the economic stability of rural communities, businesses, residents, farmers and ranchers and improve the quality of life in rural America.USDA has made a concerted effort to deliver results for the American people, even as USDA implements sequestration – the across-the-board budget reductions mandated under terms of the Budget Control Act. USDA has already undertaken historic efforts since to save more than $828 million in taxpayer funds through targeted, common-sense budget reductions. These reductions have put USDA in a better position to carry out its mission, while implementing sequester budget reductions in a fair manner that causes as little disruption as possible. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

"Closing the Gap on Food Safety   From small, family farms to large food production companies, food safety is a top priority for the folks who feed our nation and put food on tables around the globe. Participating in programs like USDA’s Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), is one way that farmers and producers of all sizes can demonstrate to buyers that they are adhering to industry food safety standards.  By making this program more accessible to businesses of all sizes, USDA is creating opportunities for our nation’s small and mid-sized farmers.  Last week I traveled to Atlanta, Ga., for the Produce Marketing Association (PMA) Fresh Summit to discuss the expansion of our GroupGAP Program this coming spring. The program is an expansion of our Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) Audit Program, which provides third-party certification services to verify that operations are following industry-recognized food safety practices as well as recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The pilot was supported by funding and technical expertise from the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and the Wallace Center at Winrock International.

"Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 13,  Lori Cook, aka TV-personality “Maranda,” interviewed me about the importance of the Summer Food Service Program.  Hunger doesn’t take a summer vacation, and the State of Michigan is making sure that nutrition assistance programs don’t either. I recently traveled to the west side of the state to see some of the inspiring work our partners are doing to make sure that no one in their community has to face hunger. I first visited Fulton Street Farmers Market in Grand Rapids, where State and community partners are implementing new initiatives to improve the health of low-income Americans, such as fruit and vegetable incentive programs and nutrition education. A Michigan Department of Community Health employee even demonstrated a new pilot program that uses iPods and iPhones to accept SNAP and WIC benefits—very impressive! This means low-income individuals can more easily access fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets, and local farmers can increase their consumer base. I also got a chance to share exciting news about USDA’s new wireless technology grants for farmers markets that currently do not accept EBT. These grants increase access to fresh, healthy food while supporting family farmers and the local economy. Afterwards I headed to Kalamazoo, where community partner Loaves & Fishes hosted an energizing roundtable. Faith-based and community organizations from around the state joined me in a thoughtful discussion of the successes and challenges in operating the 15 USDA Food and Nutrition Service programs. I always learn something new by listening to those who work directly with the people who use our programs. The Grand Rapids school district feeds so many children that it needs semi-trucks to transport all of its meals! This year, I was happy to see they designed the outside of the trucks to show just how important school and summer meals are to so many children.  Later that afternoon, the Grand Rapids Press held an editorial board/community forum. This unique set-up gave me an opportunity to live Web chat with MLive readers about USDA nutrition assistance programs. We talked about everything from Summer EBT programs that allow families to feed children during the summer to the healthy changes USDA is making to school meals. The next day the Feeding America West Michigan Food Bank gave me a tour of their facilities. This food bank pioneered the concept of mobile food pantries. By modifying a beverage truck, the food bank was able to take fresh produce out into the community. Ken Estelle told me the food bank receives about 15% of its food from USDA Foods. Finally, I was fortunate enough to attend a kickoff of West Michigan’s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). During the school year, more than 21 million children receive free and reduced-price lunch through the National School Lunch Program. And yet, when school lets out, only 3 million children receive a meal through a summer program. USDA’s SFSP is designed to address that gap, and WOOD-TV personality “Maranda” makes sure that happens every summer in western Michigan. Thousands of children came out to enjoy lunch and lots of physical activities. I’m a big supporter of the First Lady’s Let’s Move! initiative and it was great to see so many children playing outside and being active. What a fun event and a great way to end my visit to a state that is working so hard to improve the health and lives of its people!

"Natural Resource Specialist, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 17,  Wildlife cameras capture a young black bear enjoying new growth from a prescribed burn on the Pisgah National Forest. Photo credit: Lisa Jennings It was my first prescribed burn. After weeks of training and months of anticipation, I was finally on the ground – drip torch in hand – ready to apply fire to restore the mixed pine-hardwood forests at the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the Pisgah National Forest. Joining the U.S Forest Service only two months earlier, my knowledge of fire’s effect on plant and wildlife communities was limited. But as the coordinator for the Grandfather Restoration Project, part of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program, I had to quickly come up to speed with the on-the-ground reality of prescribed fire use. As I lit my drip torch that early March morning, igniting the thick leaf litter and dense shrubs that had accumulated during years of fire suppression, I couldn’t help but wonder – What happens to the wildlife after the fire? Utilizing fire is unnerving to those not familiar with fire as a restoration tool. The reality is much different; just as certain plants need fire to succeed, the animals that depend on those species benefit from fire as well. With the evolving use of prescribed fire as a restoration tool, it is critical to study the effects of fire on the communities we seek to restore. Traditional fire studies often focus on vegetation. The participants in the Grandfather Restoration Project decided to take it one step further and directly study wildlife use in sites treated with prescribed fire compared with untreated sites. Working collaboratively, wildlife specialists from Pisgah National Forest, the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission, and The Nature Conservancy designed a cutting-edge study using wildlife cameras. Re-entering the prescribed burn unit just four months after the fire, wildlife cameras in tow, I could see the changes in vegetation. Arising from the blackened ground a lush herbaceous layer had appeared, carpeting the forest with blueberries and grasses. Using 50 camera points over a six-week period in July and August, we studied the wildlife species that use our forests, and what habitats they prefer. Almost immediately, our cameras captured images of white-tailed deer, black bear, turkey and other wildlife attracted to the abundant grasses and forbs. Not only was I encouraged from the positive wildlife response to our burn, but our indicated a higher usage of the burned unit by wildlife when compared to the unburned unit; valuable information for land managers in determining population estimates and predator-prey ratios. I often think back to that first prescribed burn. I now understand what wildlife have known all along; that not only are wildlife capable of surviving fire, they reap the rewards of new growth, cover, and food stemming from fire and prescribed burning. For me, seeing these benefits firsthand is one of the most rewarding parts of my job with the U.S. Forest Service. Wild turkeys often nest in recently burned areas, taking full advantage of newly established sources of food and cover.

Nearly 200 of those acres were in Heir Property status and are currently in the process of getting a cleared title. (Photo courtesy of Randall Hildreth)  Focus on land tenure and transition issues has grown considerably in recent years, especially its impact on new and beginning farmers. ""New and beginning farmers are the future of American agriculture,"" said Deputy Secretary Harden.  ""The average age of an American farmer is 58 and increasing, so we must help new farmers get started if America is going to continue feeding the world and maintain a strong agriculture economy.""  As the age of the principal farm operator continues to increase, the focus on this issue intensifies. Land tenure, succession and estate planning, and access to land for new and beginning farmers will be among the topics discussed in a session at USDA’s Agricultural Outlook Forum this month. Succession was also one of the key focal points for the Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) survey, the results of which provided updated on these issues.  The TOTAL survey showed that U.S. farmland owners expect to transfer 91.5 million acres to new ownership over the next five years.  This represents 10 percent of all farmland across the nation. In addition to providing the number of acres expected to transition, TOTAL also provided on how the owners expect to transition this land and much more. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducted this survey jointly with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS).  At the upcoming Agriculture Outlook Forum, Mary Bohman, ERS Administrator, will moderate a panel and lead a discussion on “Land Tenure & Transition.”  Joining her on the panel will be Neil Hamilton, Professor of Law and Director of the Agricultural Law Center at Drake University, Julia Freedgood, Assistant VP for Programs at the American Farmland Trust, Greg Ibach, Director, Nebraska Department of Agriculture, Dr. Damona Doye, Regents Professor and Rainbolt Chair of Agricultural Finance at Oklahoma State University, and Randall Hildreth a farm operator in Alabama and member of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives.  To take part in the Agricultural Outlook Forum and be a part of the discussion, visit www.usda.gov/oce/forum/index.htm for more information and to register.

"Volunteer/Intern, U.S. Forest Service National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Aug 14,   Angeliz Vangas and Hanniah Rodriguez made a big impact serving as interns on the National Forests in North Carolina and are now heading back to school and continuing on their road to success. As part of the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP), this summer Vangas and Rodriguez interned in the U.S. Forest Service’s engineering department in Asheville, N.C. SCEP provides work experience that is directly related to the student's academic program or career aspirations and gives students exposure to public service while enhancing their educational goals. The civil engineering majors are rising seniors at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and have a passion for engineering. Both are members of the student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, where they serve as treasurer and secretary, respectively. The students were introduced to the Forest Service last year when they interned at the agency’s Southern Region headquarters in Atlanta, Ga. There, they were given a crash course on how engineering worked within the agency and assisted with inspections within the national forests. The energetic duo took what they learned in Atlanta and put it into practice to deliver results in Asheville, N.C. this summer. They were instrumental in developing an application for a $7 million grant to repair many of the damaged roads in the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie and Croatan National Forests in North Carolina. They transferred sketches made of the damaged roads to an Auto-CAD, which is used to produce more technical computerized models of the damaged areas. These models are crucial in formulating proposals needed to obtain the grant and to determine how best to repair the roads. Vangas and Rodriguez said interning with the Forest Service has been an engaging and insightful experience. They enjoyed working in Atlanta last year and the city life that comes with it. They said it has been particularly interesting working in Asheville, N.C. because of its close proximity to the national forests. This proximity provided them with more field work experience and to see the environment that they are affecting. “It has been really easy to adjust here because everyone has been so welcoming,” Rodriguez said. Rodriguez chose to intern with the Forest Service because of the diversity of opportunities.  “Working with the Forest Service provides two work scenarios – both field and office work,” she explained. Vangas echoed these sentiments. “It’s nice using our technical skills to help improve the forests,” she said.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  USDA Results  Trade  Oct 18,  Dutch Chef Eric Troost prepares an upscale dish using U.S. beef during a cooking demonstration for about 130 Belgian chefs Sept. 24. The demo was part of the first U.S. beef tasting event held in Belgium, which was hosted by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, and the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The tasting was part of ongoing efforts to help expand U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU). (Photo courtesy FAS The Hague)  The European Union (EU) is a relatively new market for U.S. beef exports. It wasn’t until August when the United States began exporting high-quality beef (marbled with a high fat content) to the EU under a negotiated tariff rate quota for non-hormone treated beef. Today, about 25 percent of U.S. beef exports to the EU are high-quality cuts such as tenderloin, strip loin and rib eye mostly used by upscale restaurants. The remaining beef exports include medium and lower quality cuts such as flank steak, chuck eye roll, briskets and shoulder clods. Finer restaurants in the EU traditionally do not integrate these cuts into their menus To help introduce these secondary cuts and expand U.S. beef exports to the EU, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, partnered with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and a Belgium-based meat importer and distributor to host the first U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium Sept. 24. USMEF’s international marketing efforts on behalf of U.S. beef, pork, lamb and veal are funded by the FAS Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development programs to support activities such as this event. During the U.S. beef tasting event, approximately 130 Belgian chefs learned about the preparation of these less familiar beef cuts. Local Dutch Chef Eric Troost presented various cooking demonstrations including slowly cooked top sirloin with barbecue sauce, tartar of shoulder clod with artichoke and shallots and top blade with beets, coriander and sesame vinaigrette. The chefs were excited to learn cooking techniques for the secondary beef cuts, which are nearly 40 percent cheaper than primary beef cuts, said Mary Ellen Smith, agricultural attaché at the FAS office in The Hague. “Typically, secondary cuts from European beef cannot be used for finer dishes, so the Belgian chefs were intrigued by the various cooking methods that take advantage of the unique marbling in U.S. beef,” she said. “Events like these help introduce new U.S. products not only to the chefs that prepare them but to the thousands of European consumers that they serve.” The U.S. beef tasting event is just one example of how FAS’s market development programs have a long history of helping farmers, ranchers, and businesses of all sizes build and maintain commercial markets for U.S. food and agricultural products around the world. It also helps support President Obama’s National Export Initiative, which aims to double U.S. exports by the end of . Click here to view a video recap of the U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium.

"USDA Office of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Nov 20,  General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin speaks at a press conference announcing the completion of the first-of-its kind purchase of verified carbon credits generated on working ranch lands by Chevrolet, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Nov. 17, . (L to R Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin, Ducks Unlimited Paul Schmidt, The Climate Trust Executive Director Sean Penrith, and USDA Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Robert Bonnie). USDA photo by Tom Witham. Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales. This is how the credit system works: Landowners voluntarily place lands under a perpetual easement but retain rights to work the land, such as raising livestock and growing hay. The carbon storage benefits of this avoided conversion of grasslands are quantified, verified, and formally registered resulting in carbon credits. The carbon credits are made available to entities interested in purchasing carbon offsets. Chevrolet's purchase was undertaken voluntarily as part of its commitment to reduce eight million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. This is comparable to the annual carbon reduction benefit of a mature forest the size of Yellowstone National Park. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded $161,000 through a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) to Ducks Unlimited in to develop the necessary methodology to quantify the carbon stored in the soil by avoiding grassland conversions, resulting in the generation of carbon credits. Besides the landowners, USDA, and Ducks Unlimited, other key partners that helped make this project a success include The Climate Trust, American Carbon Registry, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Terra Global Capital. Public-private partnerships to enhance U.S. carbon sinks such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal areas, are a key part of the Obama Administration’s recently released Climate and Natural Resources Priority Agenda.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Missouri in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 12,  Curtis Millsap works in the Chinese High Tunnel on his southwestern Missouri farm. NRCS photo. You can get just about anything you want at Millsap Farms, including an education about market farming. Curtis Millsap estimates that he, his family and a crew of interns feed about 200 families on 2.5 acres of his 20-acre farm near Springfield, Mo. While another seven acres of the farm sometimes includes sheep, poultry and cattle, it’s the vegetable operation that supports Millsap, his wife Sarah and their nine young children. Millsap uses two greenhouses and three seasonal high tunnels to grow produce year-round. High tunnels are plastic-covered structures that enable farmers to lengthen the growing season by using the sun’s heat to regulate temperature inside. Millsap sells through the Farmers Market of the Ozarks and to 75-100 community supported agriculture, or CSA, customers. In a CSA, people buy shares of the farm, and in return they receive a portion of the harvest when in season. One of Millsap’s high tunnels is a Chinese high tunnel, which he built with funding through a Conservation Innovation Grant from the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, Millsap received financial assistance from NRCS to install a conventional seasonal high tunnel through NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Missouri is home to hundreds of seasonal high tunnels, including nearly 500 funded by NRCS, but Millsap’s Chinese high tunnel is the only one in Missouri, and one of only a few in the United States. Millsap received $20,000 from a $50,000 Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) awarded to the Watershed Committee of the Ozarks to build the Chinese high tunnel, pay for energy renovations in other greenhouses and to establish a grazing system. This grant program helps groups demonstrate innovative approaches to improve soil quality, air quality, and water quality, conserve energy, and enhance wildlife habitat in balance with productive agricultural systems. The committee wanted to demonstrate the benefits of the Chinese high tunnel, which differs from other seasonal high tunnels in that one of the long sides of the 23-by-70-foot structure and both short ends are heavily insulated with concrete and soil. “One of the things the CIG did was improve our efficiency in the high tunnel,” Millsap said. “It is warmer in the morning and warmer in the evening (in the Chinese high tunnel) than in the other greenhouses. But what’s interesting is that midday, it is cooler in there than in the other greenhouses. This thing never spikes. It has a smooth curve, which is better for plants.” Millsap said the different design is popular in China, where energy is expensive and labor is cheap. “I was looking into the future and thinking that energy is not going to get cheaper, so it made sense,” Millsap said. “And this is a teaching farm, so I have the workers.” Millsap’s workers include seven apprentices who are compensated with room, board, a farming education and a stipend. “These are people who seriously want to experience this and see if they want to be farmers,” Millsap said. “We’ve been doing this for seven years. I’ve had 20 apprentices, and seven are still actively involved in agriculture.” The farm also serves as a site for farm tours and other community events, all intended to further the buy-local movement. High tunnels are a cornerstone of USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, which coordinates USDA’s work on local and regional food systems.  Since , through NRCS, USDA has provided assistance to help producers construct over 13,000 high tunnels on farms around the country. “We have this great promotion in ‘buy local,’ but that will go away if we can’t meet demand,” Millsap said. “We try to get as many people out to the farm as we can, show them what farming is about, maybe get their hands dirty.” Not raised on a farm, Millsap said he learned to farm by attending conferences, by reading and by visiting with lots of other farmers. He said it was something he found himself called to do. “It’s not something I was looking to do, but sometimes when you are called, you better listen,” he said.

"Northwest Regional Conservationist, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Aug 11,  The Mid-Snake River, near Twin Falls. Water Quality Trading is one way the States of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are working to protect their rivers. Photo courtesy of the Idaho DEQ Twin Falls Regional Office, used with permission. The Pacific Northwest is known for its picturesque lakes, cascading streams and dramatic coastlines. The many rivers of the Pacific Northwest—the Yakima, the Snake, Snohomish, Willamette, Klamath, Boise, and others—are part of the cultural, economic and environmental foundation of the region. These waters are meaningful for local Native American Tribes, agricultural production, industries who rely on water resources, and local communities and tourists from around the world that enjoy fishing and other forms of recreation along Northwestern rivers and streams. It’s no surprise that the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are interested in protecting their rivers to preserve these values, and the wildlife and ecosystems they’re a part of. More surprising, however, is the innovative way the states are collaborating to do it. Water quality trading allows point sources that directly discharge to water, like wastewater treatment plants, to invest in “green” infrastructure by restoring the watershed’s natural capacity to filter water. For example, instead of installing expensive technology to reduce phosphorous discharges, the treatment plant could pay farmers upstream to plant trees along their fields to reduce the same amount (or more) of phosphorous from reaching the rivers. Water quality trading may create cost savings for regulated sources, supports conservation on working agricultural lands, and generate environmental solutions that have benefits beyond just water quality—including carbon sequestration and wildlife habitat. In , the Willamette Partnership was awarded a $1.5 million Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to help facilitate a conversation with Washington, Oregon, and Idaho to develop multi-state recommendations on water quality trading. The CIG allowed the Willamette Partnership and The Freshwater Trust to convene Washington, Oregon and Idaho state department of environment staff and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 to identify common principles and practices to shape consistent approaches to trading in the region, with a focus on how trading could help regulated sources of pollutant discharges meet their discharge limits while providing additional environmental benefits. The effort resulted in a set of joint recommendations for each state to consider as they develop and further their water quality trading programs, with a goal of keeping those programs consistent with the Clean Water Act and state and local water quality laws. The recommendations address the importance of sound science, avoiding local water quality problems, providing evidence that resulting environmental benefits are real, and ensuring that these benefits are echoed in local communities. Today, the three states have committed to testing these principles and an associated set of recommendations through . Following this piloting phase, the states and EPA will discuss their experiences, and if necessary, refine their joint recommendations. The states, in consultation with partners, will decide how or whether to incorporate the joint recommendations into formal policy or guidance on trading. Bobby Cochran, Executive Director for Willamette Partnership noted, “This is a really exciting time for the Northwest. Washington, Oregon, and Idaho thought deeply about how the joint recommendations can help provide some clarity on trading, promote good stewardship, and support clean water for communities and fish.” The joint recommendations put forth by Washington, Oregon and Idaho can serve as an example for the rest of the country on how to establish well thought out trading programs that are built for success. Through CIG projects and other joint efforts, including the EPA – USDA Partnership Agreement to support water quality trading, we can do a better job of protecting water resources we rely on—while benefitting local communities, producers, and the environment.

"U.S. Forest Service, North Carolina in  Forestry  Mar 28,  For six years, U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement Office Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros patrolled the Grandfather Ranger District on the Pisgah National Forest. They were killed during a search for a homicide suspect. (U.S. Forest Service) Law-enforcement peers, U.S. Forest Service employees, dignitaries and friends gathered at the McDowell County High School in Marion, N.C. last week to honor Forest Service law enforcement officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner, Maros. Among the memorial service attendees were 75 K-9 officers and their partners who paid tribute to both fallen officers. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory were among the thousands who filled the school’s gymnasium. Crisp and Maros were shot and killed on March 12 pursuing a suspect who, just hours earlier, had allegedly killed his father and step-mother. As they had so many times before, Crisp and Maros were working to keep the Grandfather Ranger District, Pisgah National Forest, and surrounding area safe. “Jason was happy being with his family, and he was happy serving his community,” the Rev. Charles Dicks said. “He cared about the agency, and he cared about his coworkers.” These were common themes shared by speakers at the ceremony. They described the 38-year-old Crisp as a devoted husband, a loving father of two and a kind-hearted man who helped others. A Forest Service law enforcement officer for eight years, Crisp was a man of strong faith, whose spirituality served as the foundation for how he approached life. He and Maros performed their duties with honor, courage and dignity. One of Jason’s family members shared the following story prior to the ceremony.

(Courtesy of Mario Rossilli) “The last time I saw Jason, he came to my house and spent a couple of hours with me; but he was upset at me,” the grieving family member said. “I had recently helped another family member with some house work, and Jason was upset that I didn’t call to ask for his help… That’s the type of person Jason was.” March 12 was Jason’s day off. When he received the call about a murder suspect who was on the loose, he didn’t hesitate to respond. Maros assisted in the call, and it was the last time the two would answer the call of duty. Despite the tragic outcome, the two officers are not separated. Jason was laid to rest on March 17 with Maros’ ashes placed in an urn in his arms. They will be missed by the people who knew and loved them in western North Carolina. Thousands packed into the McDowell County High School to pay tribute to Forest Service Law Enforcement Officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros.

"USDA Rural Development Public Information Coordinator in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 26,   USDA Rural Development New Mexico State Director Terry Brunner (center) presents a certificate of obligation to the Ten Southern Pueblo Council Governors and representatives during ceremonies to celebrate the successful application of funds creating the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. (USDA Photo) The air was crisp and cold as the wind blew across Sandia Pueblo in mid-December.  But, the atmosphere among the Ten Southern Pueblo Governor’s Council was warm and jovial. Why? Because, the Governors were celebrating the obligation of a USDA Rural Development funded study that creates the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. For hundreds of years the residents of the Pueblos in New Mexico have farmed the land to provide the food they ate.  Today, the Native farmers continue to grow corn, squash, beans and other produce for their own consumption.  But often they have abundance of food at the end of every growing season. This successful farming can be a problem because the farmers do not have a mechanism to deliver excess produce to market or those in need.  Food hubs offer a model to provide infrastructure support to farmers usually through a central location where food can be processed and distributed. The Ten Southern Pueblos Council contracted with the Acoma Business Enterprises to serve as the fiscal manager and apply for a Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) through USDA. The RBEG financial support is funding a study to determine how best to manage the distribution of food produced by native growers through a food hub concept.  Work has begun to identify farmers and their needs to market and deliver the food to a central distribution point.  Once the is collected a plan will be implemented in to make sure the food is provided to the residents of the ten Pueblos and to others needing fresh, healthy produce for their diet.  As well, the Pueblos hope that a successful food hub offers more sustainability to native farmers who wish to make a living through farming.

"Office of Tribal Relations, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 29,  Tim Mentz Sr., Standing Rock Sioux cultural resource expert, explains the historical significance of the area that is now the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota. (U.S. Forest Service/Fred Clark) Our curiosity was palpable in our expressions, we visitors to this South Dakota field, as we pondered the patterns produced by the tops of rocks pressed into grass and soil, patterns tantalizingly organized and purposeful: shapes of things that have been. What stories were held in this small corner of the Black Hills National Forest? As members of the Forest Service’s sacred sites executive and core teams, our task is to develop ways to fulfill the recommendations from the Report to the Secretary of Agriculture: USDA Policy and Procedures Review and Recommendations: Indian Sacred Sites. Visiting this sacred place was the starting point of our learning and working together as a team. We needed to experience firsthand the feeling and meaning of this place to help us incorporate an appropriate attitude as we started three days of meetings on how to best implement the recommendations, to better protect and provide access to Indian sacred sites. We were guided and educated, at least as much as can be done in just one morning’s time, by Arvol Looking Horse and Tim Mentz Sr. Many years ago, when he was only 12, Looking Horse had been given the enormous responsibility of being the 19th generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe. He is a spiritual leader for the Lakota Dakota Na-kota Oyate, the great Sioux Nation. Mentz is a cultural resource expert with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He was their first Tribal historic preservation officer and continues to be an amazing source of information about cultural sites for his Tribe. We learned from tribal elders and Forest Service staff that these stone formations had been misinterpreted several years ago by an archaeologist as teepee rings, or circles of rocks left after having served their purpose of holding down the edges of teepees. The archaeologist had deemed these features as “insignificant” in terms of historical value. The tribal elders explained that these were no teepee rings.  Rather, the stone features were ceremonial shapes, purposefully placed and each with its own sacred reason. Having worked as an archaeologist for some 20 years myself, including having mapped and excavated teepee rings in Montana and Wyoming, I was also aware that these forms were far from the evenly rounded rings I’d seen many times before. They were shapes, but shapes of what? The elders explained how the features are organized, how they relate to the surrounding landscape, the directions, other sites both near and far, and a bit about what each feature’s functions would have been. They pointed out the meaning behind the features and talked about how these places have current and ongoing power. Mentz and his crew mapped the entire site during our visit, and related the physical shapes and functions to hundreds of other sites they had recorded. They talked about how many of these types of sites had already been destroyed by development, and how many are endangered. They showed us the life and significance in the rocks, reinforcing the great need to further protect places like this. While many of the sites being destroyed are on private land, the message was urgent and relates directly to our task of doing a better job within the agency to protect the places held sacred by American Indians and Alaska Natives on national forests and grasslands. Meeting and working with elders like Looking Horse and Mentz and having them share this kind of information, we are better prepared to bring to this work a good mind and a good heart, and better able to affect the shape of things to come.

Today, there are close to 20 barrier-free fishing piers in the four national forests. Through careful planning, design and construction -- in partnership with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission -- accessible fishing facilities have been constructed from the mountains to the sea. The facilities provide fishing opportunities in warm-water reservoirs and small ponds, as well as cold-water streams and rivers. “Designs of fishing piers that extend over waterways have been refined over the years and have been adopted for use by the Wildlife Resources Commission throughout the state,” said Lynn Hicks, engineer and heritage and recreation staff officer. ”Site-specific designs have provided accessible parking and routes to these water-based sites, and most of the fishing piers include areas for both seated and standing fishing.” Recent piers include a metal mesh water-viewing component into a portion of the pier’s flooring. Accessible facilities on majestic Cherokee Lake in Nantahala National Forest include picnic tables and a pavilion, all connected along an accessible route.

In many communities, the piers have become centers for frequent outdoor recreation. For example, Boone Fork Pond pier, near the communities of Lenoir and Hudson, is commonly used as an outdoor destination for the mentally and physically challenged. Chapters of Wounded Warriors have assisted with projects, particularly on the Croatan National Forest. Other partners who have provided funding or assistance in constructing these facilities include Trout Unlimited, the Muskie Club, and Bass Anglers Sportsmen Society. The two piers near Robbinsville -- one on a small pond, the other on Santeetlah Lake -- provide community fishing opportunities. Many of these accessible fishing facilities are used during National Fishing Week activities, including sites for Special Needs Fishing Days. Great Outdoors Month is a time for all Americans to get outside and take part in a number of national events that encourage people to hike, fish, boat and/or camp at locations all across the country.  June 9 is also a fee free day for public lands including national forests.  So join friends and family and take time to celebrate our national heritage and enjoy the wonders of our national landscape.

"Program Analyst, USDA Office of Environmental Markets, Office of the Chief Economist in  Conservation  Dec 16,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaking at a press conference in Fairfax, VA. USDA photo by David Kosling. USDA has a long history of helping farmers, ranchers and forest landowners maintain their bottom line while improving soil health and reducing runoff into streams and rivers.  For nearly 80 years, USDA has offered funding and technical assistance for farmers to implement conservation practices through the conservation title of the Farm Bill. In recent years, however, USDA has also supported new, innovative approaches to voluntary, private lands conservation. An announcement today by USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, and Administrator Gina McCarthy of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in northern Virginia highlights an innovative approach called water quality trading. Farmers like John Harrison of Appomattox County are taking advantage of private investments to implement conservation practices on their land. These practices help reduce erosion and nutrient runoff into local bodies of water, generating nutrient credits that can then be sold to regulated entities looking to offset nutrient losses for compliance purposes. In this case, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) purchased phosphorous credits to offset water quality impacts from road construction. The offset credits have permitted the completion of more than 40 small road construction projects that improve traffic safety and flow by adding turn lanes, clover leafs, and small connectors, and repairing approaches to aging bridges. Compared to traditional engineered practices, the offset credits provide greater water quality benefits for up to half of the costs of installation and long-term maintenance. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (left) participates in a press conference with Commonwealth of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

Mr. Harrison appears in a USDA video explaining the project and the benefits realized on his farm. The project was the result of collaboration between the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, with support from USDA, the Federal Highway Administration and EPA.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Colorado in  Conservation  Mar 31,  The Southwestern willow flycatcher is an endangered bird that lives in the riparian areas of the Southwest. Photo courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The distinctive “fitz-bew” of the Southwestern willow flycatchers is music to the ears of the partners of Wetland Dynamics, LLC, and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) recently improved the ability to hear them. Wetland Dynamics received a $60,000 Conservation Innovation Grant from NRCS in to develop innovative technology for monitoring the endangered flycatcher and two other imperiled species in Colorado’s San Luis Valley. “What we’re doing is innovative,” said Jenny Nehring, a biologist and partner at Wetland Dynamics. “The technology we’re using has been around for quite some time. But with the partnership now forged with NRCS, we are able to expand and improve our innovative techniques that build upon existing tools, which will in turn help to better understand certain wildlife species and improve protection of them.” Wetland Dynamics is expanding and exploring the use of a passive acoustic monitoring technology traditionally used to monitor bats and aquatic species like whales. The company is using this innovative technology to improve detection and monitoring of the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Western yellow-billed cuckoo and Northern leopard frog. The flycatcher, cuckoo and leopard frog are currently being monitored, but the widely used approach takes substantial labor and stresses birds. By recording the birds’ noises, Wetland Dynamics is able to study the endangered Southwestern willow flycatcher. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics. “It requires an observer in the field broadcasting the call of the bird to illicit a response from a bird on a territory,” Nehring said. “This method is intrusive and tricks the birds into thinking its territory is being threatened or infringed upon. Birds will, of course, react, but this reaction is stressful and energetically costly to already threatened and endangered species.” The new way of monitoring, funded by the grant from NRCS, eliminates the stress on the bird while expanding the information gathered. It relies on passive recording equipment. Because the devices can be stationed for prolonged periods of time, the consistency and quantity of information gathered will provide increased detection of species.  These more accurate detections will allow more focused and precise research on other things such as breeding success and habitat use. Between observer bias and influences like weather, which might prevent an observer from even reaching a monitoring site, the margin for error within the typical call play back monitoring method is high. A grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is enabling Wetland Dynamics to expand its monitoring efforts of the Southwestern willow flycatcher and other at-risk species of the riparian habitat. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics. “Our recorders are stationary devices, can be set up for weeks and have limited disturbance. Recordings are then scanned to detect the vocalization of interest and to differentiate varying vocalizations like birds that are close or far away.” Although this technology is promising and is quite significant for future monitoring of species in areas, it cannot determine the number of species in a particular area. “But it can detect if the bird is present which will help researchers focus their on-the-ground field work to determine territory size, breeding effort and success as well as habitat condition,” she said. “More work is clearly needed and that’s why the CIG grant was so important.  It allows us to refine and test the technology and quantify perimeters for accuracy. We greatly value our partnership with NRCS and hope it grows so that other monitoring opportunities can be explored.” Conservation Innovation Grants aim to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies. This is one of NRCS’ many investments in the Southwest to help the flycatcher and other species. NRCS announced Monday its plans to broaden the conservation opportunities available to producers.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Earth Team Volunteer in  Conservation  Jun 17,  Honeybees leaving and returning to the hive after collecting pollen. Photo: Ashton Ebarb. “They’re in a happy mood today,” Jim Pratt, a local apiarist, said. At a comfortable 62 degrees, honeybees buzz with a clear objective: collect nectar and pollen, for honey and pollination. “Pollinators, like honeybees, support food crops,” Pratt said, explaining why for 20 years he’s raised honeybees. Pratt’s Farm annually produces about 120 pounds of honey per colony. He maintains 100 colonies, collecting honey from them each spring, summer and fall. During the winter, the bees eat stored honey until warmer weather arrives. Honeybees, like all pollinators, face challenges. Lack of habitat is the number one local threat Pratt sees to pollinators. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to implement conservation practices on the ground that have numerous environmental benefits, including ones that provide habitat and food for pollinators. “Much of our local land is managed pastures,” Pratt said. Pastures provide benefits in various forms of agriculture, yet there are times between seasons when nothing is grown to attract pollinators across vast measures of land. “As a beekeeper, I seek out managed pastures over-seeded with clover. Placing colonies of honeybees in and around the pastures benefits not only the beekeeper with the potential of premium grade honey, but also benefits the landowner by sustaining the clover population as a result of the necessary pollination by the bees.” With NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), landowners can offset the cost of over-seeding clovers in their pastures and adjacent tracts specifically for pollinator species. “Pastures over-seeded with clover provide benefits in various forms of agriculture,” Pratt explained. “First, pollinators of all types are attracted to it. Second, clover replenishes nitrogen in the soil which better supports livestock forage.”  Since clovers are a cool-season legume, and usually die-back with the onset of mid-Summer, Pratt looks for tracts of land with natural habitat, such as wildlife refuges, conservation reserves and pollinator plantings adjacent to the pastures for nectar and pollen sources after the clover has died. Pollinators need nearby habitats which is vital to sustaining their populations. People need pollinators, too. No matter the pollinator, whether bee, bird, beetle, butterfly, bat or any other, all contribute to our food supply by pollination. “90 percent of fruits and vegetables are not self-pollinating,” said Janice Hutton, horticulturalist with The Sabine River Authority in Sabine Parish, Louisiana. Fruits and vegetables almost entirely depend upon pollinators. Every living person and thing that depends on fruits and vegetables depends on pollinators too. The good news: helping pollinators achieve their goal is as simple as growing certain plants. “I have to know what blooms, when it blooms and whether each colony has enough worker bees to collect nectar and pollen,” said Pratt. This week, USDA is celebrating National Pollinator Week by highlighting the many ways in which conservation benefits pollinators. Through the Farm Bill, landowners have an opportunity to receive financial assistance through conservation programs and practices, which includes planting cover crops to target these beneficial pollinators.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 08,   The Forest Service has added an iPhone/iPad application called Invasive Plants in Southern Forests: Identification and Management to its strategy of reducing nonnative invasive plants in the South. The free app will allow more people to get involved in eradicating foreign plants, which, along with nonnative animals and pathogens, harm water supplies.  They also harm native plants, wildlife, livestock and property in both rural and urban areas at a cost of about $138 billion annually. Using Forest Service funding and research, the University of Georgia Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health created the software from the Southern Research Station publications A Field Guide for the Identification of Invasive Plants in Southern Forests and A Management Guide for Invasive Plants in Southern Forests. The U.S. Forest Service is a leading agency working to reduce the impact of the hundreds of invasive plants threatening public and private lands. The application was funded by a grant from the Forest Service Southern Research Station’s Insects, Diseases and Invasive Plants unit. The software provides photos and information that allow users to identify the 56 nonnative plants and plant groups currently invading 13 Southern states. “Ultimately we hope this app will give people a new tool to go out and identify invasive plants and map their occurrence,” said Southern Research Station Research Ecologist James Miller, who co-authored the application’s source guides. “Effective control relies on understanding of species and how they spread across the landscape. Those are important first steps in stopping and containing the invasions of harmful nonnative plants.” Like the publications it was developed from, the app divides nonnative invasive plants into trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, ferns and forbs, and provides identification keys, photos and management recommendations. The app also gives users simple, on-the-spot options for treating invasive plants. Future versions of the application will include the ability to directly report new sightings of select species into the Georgia Center’s Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS), which provides a quick way to submit photos and report new sightings of invasive plants on the spot throughout the United States.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Research and Science  May 22,  During April and May ramps are often served in restaurants in the eastern U.S. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. To many of locals in western North Carolina, they’re called wild leeks.  Some call them ransoms and still others call them wood garlic because of their pungent smell. Nevertheless, ecologists simply call them ramps. This native plant has been useful to humans since inhabiting the eastern regions of the U.S. and Canada.  Still today, locals harvest ramps for food, medicinal preparations, and to sell at markets and spring festivals. U.S. Forest Service scientist Joan Walker has been monitoring populations of ramps in the mountain coves of western North Carolina for 11 years. The results of her research show that although abundance can vary from year to year, about a quarter of the plots had decreasing ramps cover. “All of the plots that showed a decrease were where harvesting disturbance was high,” said Walker who is based out of the agency’s Southern Research Station. “Also, harvested plots as a group have reduced ramps populations compared to undisturbed ones.” These results suggest that it may be time to re-examine the current harvest policy and perhaps take corrective measures to ensure the species will be available for future generations of Americans. In the Southern Appalachians, many prime sites for harvesting ramps are within national forest boundaries. The National Forest System is responsible for maintaining biological diversity to sustain valuable ecosystem services such as clean air and water, healthy soil, abundant wood, recreational opportunities and other forest-based commodities that include herbs and edible plants. Ramps are among the first ephemeral greens to emerge during the spring months of March and April. With their electric green leaves, plump, white bulb and distinct odor, ramps are easy to distinguish from other early growers. After a hard winter in the mountains with food stores running low, this green “manna” would have literally been a life saver to both Native Americans and settlers living throughout the region in years past. Concerns about harvesting effects in the southern range (northern Georgia and Alabama and western North Carolina) prompted Walker’s monitoring study in two areas of the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. The goal of the project is to track the populations over time and to determine if trends are related to local harvesting, weather, or even changing climate. The monitoring study consists of 25 plots distributed between 3,500 feet to just over 5,000 feet in elevation.

"Southern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 11,  Healthy seagrass meadows prevent erosion on coasts, store carbon, and provide marine animals with food and habitat. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency) Just off Florida’s 8,000 miles of coastline and tidal areas, in shallow sunlit waters, over two million acres of seagrass meadows waft in the ocean currents. Besides providing food and habitat for manatees, sea turtles, shellfish, and other animals, seagrasses protect coasts from erosion and store vast quantities of carbon dioxide. “Seagrasses grow off the coast of many other U.S. states, including North Carolina and Virginia, as well as around the world,” said U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station scientist Zanethia Choice. “Globally, their economic value is nearly $4 trillion.” Although more closely related to lilies than to terrestrial grasses, like most of their distant grass kin, seagrasses require plenty of sunlight. Poor water quality reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches them, and seagrasses around the world are threatened by practices that affect water quality such as wastewater disposal and fertilizer runoff. Choice, a natural resource specialist at the research center’s Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research, and her colleagues from the University of Florida recently studied light requirements for four common seagrass species along the Florida Gulf Coast. The study was published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin. “We found a direct relationship between the amount of light reaching the ocean floor and the amount and diversity of seagrasses growing there,” said Choice. In 90 percent of sites where 13 years of historic showed that adequate sunlight had been reaching the ocean floor, researchers found thriving seagrass meadows. However, areas with suitable light but no seagrass were most likely due to unsuitable substrate, temperature, and the amounts of dissolved salts and oxygen. Seagrasses are adapted to nutrient-poor waters. When nutrients – whether from fertilizer runoff, wastewater disposal, or other human activities – wash into the ocean, they float suspended in the ocean waters. Seagrasses cannot use these suspended nutrients very efficiently, but tiny algae called phytoplankton can. Phytoplankton thrive in nutrient-rich waters, and as they grow, they intercept light and shade the ocean floor. Seagrasses were notably absent from areas with high nutrient levels. Some seagrasses such as star grass could survive with as little as 8 percent of sunlight reaching the ocean floor, while other species 25 percent sunlight or more. “Light requirements for all the seagrasses we studied differed from previous findings at other locations,” said Choice. “The differences are probably due to morphological and physiological differences, and adaptation to light histories at specific locations.” Understanding the light requirements of different seagrass species is essential for coastal managers who want to maintain seagrass habitats, and managing for seagrass health also provides water quality targets that can benefit other marine life.

"Public Affairs Specialist, NRCS California in  Conservation  Jul 28,  A planning meeting with Freitas at the Redding Service Center.  Shasta County landowner Karen Freitas has worked with the staff of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) since , when she sought help recovering from a devastating wild fire that had burned much of her 160-acre tree farm the previous summer. Helping agricultural producers recover after a natural disaster is fairly routine work for NRCS, and the Redding office, where Freitas went for assistance, was no different. But what was unusual for these NRCS employees is that Freitas is deaf—presenting an unusual opportunity for client assistance. Freitas approached the Redding NRCS office initially for assistance rebuilding her operation, and District Conservationist Bob Bailey was able to help her put together a conservation plan and an application for cost-share funding through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Conservation work implemented under the first contract she signed with NRCS covered water control structures, brush management, critical area plantings, fuel breaks, tree and shrub establishment, forest site preparation, forest stand improvement and access road work. More recently, Freitas has been working with NRCS to develop a forest management plan on her property. District Conservationist Bob Bailey, Karen Freitas and Forester Jeff Webster working on a forest management plan with the assistance of a sign language interpreter.  Initially it seemed there might be some communication challenges in working with a hearing-impaired client, especially in some of the more technical aspects of the work. Freitas was the first deaf client NRCS California’s Redding office had ever helped. But the office contracted for professional sign language interpretative services, with excellent results. Since then, District Conservationist Bailey has used an interpreter several times to facilitate communications between Freitas and NRCS staff during planning meetings and implementation of projects in the field. “Using an interpreter has worked out great,” Bailey says. “I feel a sense of satisfaction that I was able to assist Mrs. Freitas with her forest management objectives. She is one of the hardest working clients I have, and she takes great satisfaction in the conservation projects she completes.” NRCS often works with clients to meet their communication needs, relying not only on American Sign Language interpreters, but also interpreters for non-hearing impaired landowners and land managers whose first language is not English. A sign language interpreter facilitates communication as Bob Bailey explains how soil erosion concerns on an access road might be addressed.  In addition, USDA has many department-wide provisions to ensure equal access to services for traditionally underserved groups such as women and black farmers, low-income farmers, and Tribes.

"Web Communications Intern in  USDA Results  Initiatives  Energy  Forestry  Sep 16,  Rick Huszagh and Crista Carrell, Down to Earth Energy, Georgia Cross posted from the White House Rural Champions of Change website: When Rick Huszagh and Crista Carrell purchased part of her family’s farm in , their focus was on farmland preservation as much as the creation of a successful business enterprise. Mountain Creek Farm started out selling Boer goats to purebred and commercial breeders and bermuda hay to neighboring horse farms. Goat kids were raised each spring to sell for breeding stock or meat.  The couple improved their farm marketing by participating in shows, performance tests, and field days.  The farm’s proximity to the University of Georgia facilitated their involvement in herd management studies related to the control of internal parasites. They took full advantage of resources offered by the Cooperative Extension Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and participated in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Rick and Crista’s interest in sustainability issues on the farm led them to research and implement small-scale biodiesel production for the tractors in . In , they intensified their renewable energy involvement when they were awarded a Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP) grant and USDA guaranteed loan. Along with like-minded partners, they established Down to Earth Energy, a commercial biodiesel production facility located adjacent to the farm. Concern with some of the inefficiencies in the biodiesel process led them to partner with the University of Georgia to develop a more effective catalyst.  The concept was further funded by an EPA Small Business Innovation Research Grant (SBIR) and a Venturelab grant. Crista was appointed a Walton County Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor in . She has spearheaded the district’s sponsorship of community forestry activities in Monroe and served as the coordinator of Atha Road Elementary School’s outdoor classroom from -.

"Forest Service Research & Development in  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 03,  Kellie Carim, eDNA coordinator for the Genomics Center, collects and processes samples. (Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research profile. The U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. The Forest Service’s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station’s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.  collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management. Imagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. “eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

"Hoosier National Forest in  May 13,  Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- A group of Hoosier National Forest employees plant chestnut trees in a timber sale area of the Hoosier to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service). Once a prominent phenomenon in southern Indiana, Bedford just experienced the first re-planting of American chestnut trees on the Hoosier National Forest in partnership with Purdue University and the U.S. Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “Historically, the American chestnut was once one of the most important trees in the eastern United States, occupying about 25 percent of the hardwood canopy in eastern forests,” said David Cleaves, climate change advisor for the Forest Service. The trees grew to be 80 feet tall or more, and were known as ‘the redwood of the East.’  By the s, the tree was nearly wiped out by an Asian fungus known as chestnut blight.  The restoration of American chestnut to eastern forests depends on the development of blight-resistant seedlings. The Forest Service, American Chestnut Foundation, and the University of Tennessee have been conducting research and tests to produce a blight-resistant American chestnut, with aspirations of restoring the species in its grandeur. Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- Forest Botanist Kirk Larson (foreground) plants an American chestnut tree on the Hoosier National Forest to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service).  A traditional back-cross breeding method is being used to create blight-resistant American chestnut seedlings, which are 94 percent American chestnut and 6 percent Chinese chestnut --- and are blight resistant. The restoration effort began when the American Chestnut Restoration Project partners planted seedlings in three national forests in Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina in early . Scientists say the seedlings are surpassing expectations of survival and they are cautiously optimistic. A full decade will need to pass before massive replanting begins.  But the trees will be given every opportunity to do well. They were planted in a fenced enclosure to keep out deer and minimize damage from wildlife, and herbicides will be applied as needed to control undesirable competition.

These measures, combined with a decade-long wait period before massive replanting begins, are designed to give the seedlings every opportunity to thrive and eventually restore the American chestnut tree to its former prominence in eastern forests."
"Manager, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  May 25,  Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer, then allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming. Cross posted from the FoodSafety.gov blog:  On May 24, USDA made some important changes in their recommended cooking temperatures for meats. Here’s what you need to know: Cooking Whole Cuts of Pork: USDA has lowered the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 ºF to 145 ºF with the addition of a three-minute rest time. Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source, with a three-minute rest time before carving or consuming. This will result in a product that is both safe and at its best quality—juicy and tender. Cooking Whole Cuts of Other Meats: For beef, veal, and lamb cuts, the safe temperature remains unchanged at 145 ºF, but the department has added a three-minute rest time as part of its cooking recommendations. What Cooking Temperatures Didn’t Change? Ground Meats: This change does not apply to ground meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork, which should be cooked to 160 ºF and do not require a rest time. Poultry: The safe cooking temperature for all poultry products, including ground chicken and turkey, stays the same at 165 ºF. What Is Rest Time?  “Rest time” is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys harmful bacteria. Why Did the Recommendations Change? It’s just as safe to cook cuts of pork to 145 º F with a three-minute rest time as it is to cook them to 160 ºF, the previously recommended temperature, with no rest time. The new cooking recommendations reflect the same standards that the agency uses for cooked meat products produced in federally inspected meat establishments, which rely on the rest time of three minutes to achieve a safe product. Having a single time and temperature combination for all meat will help consumers remember the temperature at which they can be sure the meat is safe to eat. How Do You Use a Food Thermometer? Place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food. It should not touch bone, fat, or gristle. Start checking the temperature toward the end of cooking, but before you expect it to be done. Be sure to clean your food thermometer with hot soapy water before and after each use. To see where to place a food thermometer in different cuts of meat, see Thermometer Placement and Temperatures. For more information on cooking temperatures for all types of food, see the Safe Minimum Cooking Temperatures chart. If you have questions about cooking meat, feel free to contact us at the Hotline or online at Ask USDA.

"Under Secretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  May 21,   I had the distinct pleasure of visiting the birthplace of former Agriculture Secretary Henry A. Wallace during a recent trip to Iowa.  In fact, my tour of the farm near Orient in south central Iowa happened to be May 15, the day the USDA celebrated its 150th anniversary. Wallace was Secretary of the Agriculture from March 4, until September 4, .  He served as Vice President of the United States from to under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was also Secretary of Commerce from to . Wallace is perhaps the 20th Century’s most well-known Ag Secretary and his accomplishments are monumental. The Wallace Centers of Iowa. Henry A. Wallace was born in Iowa and went on to serve as Vice President and as cabinet secretary of two departments, including USDA. He helped guide the creation of the Farm Security Administration, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the Rural Electrification Administration (REA). USDA Rural Development, the mission area that I lead, traces its roots back to the REA. Food stamps (now the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) and the school lunch programs were also started during Wallace’s time as Ag Secretary. Wallace was also dedicated to research and science. The USDA’s research center in Beltsville, Maryland, became the largest and most varied scientific research station in the world during his time as Secretary. My visit to Wallace’s birthplace also served another purpose as the Wallace Centers of Iowa recently received a $50,ep at a Time. This program is helping farmers in southwest Iowa add value to the fruit and vegetable they harvest by providing guidance and training on such things as food safety protocols, recipe development and testing and product placement. More and more people want to know where their food is coming from and are requesting locally grown foods. They also recognize the importance of supporting local producers and local economies. Agriculture Under Secretary for Rural Development speaks about the Department's 150th anniversary during an event at the Wallace Country Life Center I want to thank Diane Weiland and all her wonderful staff for such a great time at the Henry A. Wallace Country Life Center. It was a tremendous way to celebrate the 150th anniversary.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Dec 01,  BAC!®, the Discovery Zone’s “green bacteria” mascot greets Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show attendees as they line up to tour the interactive and educational Food Safety Discovery Zone.  Last month, thousands of foodies packed into the Washington Convention Center for the Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show to gain culinary wisdom from like Paula Deen, Guy Fieri, Giada De Laurentiis, and… the USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone. Among the live demonstrations and more than 300 vendors, there consistently was a line of people waiting for a tour of the Food Safety Discovery Zone. Chefs and guests alike remarked about the 40-foot long yellow truck’s uniqueness, and everyone who toured the interactive exhibit learned something new. A favorite game among visitors was trying to guess which of two identical-looking burgers had been cooked to 160 °F and was safe to eat. Using a food thermometer to check their answer, many were shocked to see that they had guessed wrong! As they exited the Discovery Zone, people grabbed free copies of the Kitchen Companion handbook, keychains with food safety reminders, and food thermometers. One couple returned to the Discovery Zone late in the afternoon to report their shock that a vendor touched raw meat and then served them a cooked sample without washing his hands. “Really? Well, it’s good that you noticed!  It’s scary, right? It’s so easy to get sick if people don’t follow our recommendations,” Discovery Zone staffer Eileen Dykes told them, smiling. “You now know what you can do to protect yourselves and your loved ones!” BAC!®, the Discovery Zone’s “green bacteria” costumed mascot posed for pictures with younger visitors. Appealing to foodies of all ages, the Discovery Zone staff made a big impression on the Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show’s attendees and showed them how they can protect themselves and their families from foodborne illness.

"Technical Information Specialist, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  Mar 25,  Food safety is a key ingredient for a successful meal. Visit FoodSafety.gov for more information on the four key food safety steps: clean, separate, cook and chill. Ahh, Spring! This week, a new season is getting a nice kick-off with Passover and Easter holidays. These celebrations are filled with traditional meals that have unique food safety considerations that may or may not be included in the family recipe book. The USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline has some food safety tips and steps here that, if added to your favorite recipes, can reduce the risk of food poisoning.  As with any food preparation, always remember to Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill. Before preparing any meal, wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, and clean surfaces and utensils with hot soapy water before and after handling raw food. Perishable food should not be left out for more than two hours at room temperature, so check the time at your gathering and make sure either to get food back in the refrigerator or to discard it. Refrigerated leftovers for all foods in this blog should be used within four days.  Beef Brisket: One reason that it’s an excellent choice for entertaining is that it can be prepared in advance. In fact, you must prepare it in advance and cook it slowly to make it tender. Also, because it can be cooked ahead of time and it reheats well, brisket is a great cut of meat to serve to large groups.  Follow these food safety tips for cooking and serving brisket: Be sure to allow plenty of time to thaw a frozen brisket. Thawing in the refrigerator can take about 24 hours for a trimmed, first-cut brisket. A whole brisket weighing about 10 pounds can take several days. Keep raw meat refrigerated at 40 ˚F or below until ready to cook. Place the meat on a plate or container to hold the juices that can drip on other foods to prevent cross-contamination. Bake the brisket, fat side up in a baking dish, in an oven set no lower than 325 ˚F. The brisket is safe to eat when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 °F and is allowed to rest at that temperature for three minutes. Use a food thermometer to be sure. For personal preferences, consumers may choose to cook the brisket longer for tenderness. If reheating brisket before serving, remember to reheat to 165 °F.To serve brisket cold, keep it at 40 °F or below by nesting dishes in beds of ice, or use small servings platters and replace them often. Ham: There are many kinds of hams on the market, but your family likely is purchasing a fully cooked ham. Here are tips for storing and serving a fully cooked ham: When buying a ham, look for the USDA or State Mark of Inspection.  Refrigerate the ham at 40 ˚F or below immediately after arriving home. These hams are best served cold. However, if you want to reheat them, set the oven at 325 ˚F and heat to an internal temperature of 140 °F as measured with a food thermometer. If the ham was repackaged at your butcher shop or grocer, reheat it to 165 °F. Individual slices may also be warmed in a skillet or microwave. Deviled Eggs: Follow these food safety tips below for making an egg dish such as deviled eggs. Remember, eggs are perishable just like raw meat, poultry, and fish, and could contain pathogens. Our virtual food safety expert, Ask Karen, has helpful instructions on how to boil eggs. After cooking the eggs, it is a good idea to keep the whites refrigerated while preparing the filling. Keep deviled eggs chilled until you are ready to serve. Eggs should not stay at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Use a cooler with ice when transporting to another location.

Sept. 17, . The U.S. Forest Service operates the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Corps, the Nation’s largest residential, educational and career technical training program for young Americans. USDA photo by Bob Nichols. Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Economic Opportunity Act.  This Act, part of the government effort to wipe out poverty, created the Job Corps program, which has had a positive effect on countless young lives, giving them a chance to break multi-generational cycles of poverty, get an education, and find jobs in the federal and private sectors, and in the military.  The U.S. Forest Service works closely with the Department of Labor to operate Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (Job Corps CCCs) around the country. Last week, dignitaries including Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell, and Tina Terrell, Forest Service National Director of the Job Corps, along with colleagues from the Department of Labor, came together in Washington at USDA’s Whitten Building to mark the anniversary. As Chief of Staff for Natural Resources and Environment here at USDA, I am a passionate advocate for this program. Not only does it change families, it allows students to practice conservation on public lands and it also creates a trained group of firefighters to battle wildfire. In the previous two fiscal years, Job Corps CCC students accomplished more than 500,000 hours of service work on public lands. This year, we connected nearly 1,500 of our Job Corps students to training opportunities as part of the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps . In addition to work on public lands, Job Corps CCC students also work on projects that contribute to their local community. During the anniversary event, Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, who grew up on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico, spoke of the profound difference that was made when one of America’s first Job Corps centers came to his reservation. “We learned a lot, and it added to the diversity of our community.” He talked about how the Center and others like it produced success and gave students hope for the future. Chief Tidwell thanked everyone, but especially the students, past and present. He acknowledged the partnership forged with the U.S. Department of Labor and commented that during the summer of passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, the Wilderness Act and the Civil Rights Act made history in America.  As important as the last 50 years have been, the Chief said, this is “a moment in history, a time to reflect and celebrate, but also a time to dream of what is next.” National Director Tina Terrell, born in Philadelphia, said that the Job Corps allows students access to the path she took, going from a life where all she knew about trees was “that they were in my back yard” to a fulfilling career with the Forest Service. “The future is up to you,” she said, “Culinary arts, Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, or an avenue for you if you want to work in the Forest Service.” She said it best: “After 50 years, it is all about love of nature, love of the land, and helping young folks.

"Thanksgiving Is a Great Time to Start Reducing Food Waste with Friends & Family  Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate all that is good in our lives and to spend it in the company of friends and family while enjoying great food.  It is also a time to reflect on the bounty of our food supply.  Each year, as I put away the leftovers from my Thanksgiving dinner, I marvel at the abundance. I also can’t avoid pausing to consider how much food is wasted in this country. USDA estimates that on average, American consumers waste about one-fifth of food that is available to them, equivalent to about $371 per person annually.  That’s enough money to buy about 21 whole turkeys for each person in the country.

"Philly Market Rises Up to Meet Hunger Challenge  Did you know that nearly one-third of the food available to U.S. retailers and consumers never makes it to the dining room table?  That’s 133 billion pounds of food going to waste--all of which has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation, and climate change.  Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That’s why my agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.  Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away.  While these fresh foods weren’t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn’t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.  Bruce Summers, Agricultural Marketing Service Associate Administrator  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 06,   Respond to this story","What percentage of food available to U.S. retailers and consumers could be saved by reducing food waste by just 15%, and what would be the equivalent benefit for American food security?","Reducing food waste by 15% would save approximately one-third (33%) of the wasted food, which is equivalent to enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year."

In between trying to convince your 21-year-old nephew to sit at the kid’s table (because there’s no room at the adult table) and figuring out how you’ll answer your relatives’ questions about where your current relationship is going, we want to help you prepare your meal. With such thoughts possibly running through your head, proper food safety practices are sometimes treated like pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving: always but too often ignored and overshadowed.

"Merrigan Meets Main Street in Momence, Illinois  This week, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan toured the Main Street of Momence, Il, to view the positive growth made possible by USDA’s investments in rural revitalization. The community was decorated with corn stalks and fall mums to welcome Agriculture Deputy Secretary Merrigan to this town of 3,200 people, located 50 miles south of Chicago.  Merrigan and Momence residents enthusiastically toured several businesses that received financing thanks to a USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG), administered by the USDA Rural Development agency.  Last year USDA provided a $99,000 grant to “Main Street Momence,” a preservation and volunteer based economic development program, to help them establish a revolving, low-interest loan fund.  The program is designed to help small businesses locate or remain in Momence’s historic downtown area. Thirteen months later, four businesses have taken advantage of the increased access to credit by taking out loans. As a result, these businesses have created 27 new full time jobs and saved another 21 in this past year alone.

"Office of Communications in  Conservation  USDA Results  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Technology  Feb 03,  In the 151 years since the U.S. Department of Agriculture was founded, America's oldest industry has evolved to meet the changing needs of our modern agricultural landscape. From growing overseas markets, building a 21st century rural infrastructure, and finding ways to address the challenges of climate change, USDA has worked beside farmers, businesses, and community leaders to streamline programs and spur innovative solutions for today's challenges. For USDA, that also means looking inward and changing the way we do business. We have done this by designing initiatives that collectively utilize the full scope of our mission, better focusing resources and staff across the Department to meet the needs of the communities we serve using modern tools, technology, and processes. USDA's recently expanded StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity initiative illustrates this trend with a broad commitment to rally available tools and technical assistance to combat persistent poverty in rural communities in 20 states. Our Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative aims to support the rapidly expanding local and regional food market with new products and services, as well as tailored cross-agency web resources and that illustrate opportunities and promote local and regional food systems. And finally, through the Blueprint for Stronger Service, USDA responded to the uncertain fiscal environment by streamlining mission critical work and taking a close look at operations to find ways to cut costs and modernize processes to be better stewards of taxpayer dollars - with great results. Over the next month we'll share more about the ways that USDA has evolved to meet the needs of modern agriculture in America. We'll use hashtag  on social media to share these stories, but we want to hear from you too. In the video above, Secretary Vilsack asked you to lend your voice to our collective story of how YOUR community has evolved to meet the needs of the 21st century. A new hospital?

"Public Information Coordinator – USDA-Rural Development – Alaska in  Rural  Dec 01,   They say nothing beats teamwork and that can certainly be said about a very forward-thinking and ambitious project being led by USDA-Rural Development in Alaska. USDA-RD Alaska State Director Jim Nordlund is leading the efforts to coordinate several federal agencies in organizing statewide collaboration meetings with Alaska tribal governments.  The collaboration will involve 12-18 meetings held over the next eleven months.  This effort is in response to a memorandum signed by President Obama directing federal agencies to engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials. There are 229 federally recognized tribes in Alaska and nearly all coincide with rural villages.  The USDA led plan involves face-to-face collaboration meetings with the acknowledged leader or single point of contact for each tribe. The meetings will be held in local communities and will involve a conversation with several tribal leaders in an area that is geographically distinct and culturally homogenous. “Collaboration with 229 tribes in their local areas is a large undertaking, but we feel this is the best way to understand the needs of Native communities and to seek their advice,” said Nordlund.     “Through these meetings we hope to strengthen the government-to-government relationship between tribal leaders and the federal government; provide an overview, by topic, of certain federal programs that have an effect on tribes; and engage in constructive dialogue, respond to questions and solicit ideas regarding federal programs,” added Nordlund. The consultation discussions will be focused on five topics: Food production, availability and nutrition Rural housing Natural Resources Conservation Service and Forest Service Rural utilities (electric, telecom, solid waste, sewer and water) Rural economic and community development Five USDA agencies will participate in the meetings, including Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), Forest Service, and Food and Nutrition Service.  Additionally, five other federal agencies with similar programs will be represented, including: Department of Housing and Urban Development, Small Business Administration, Economic Development Administration, Department of Energy and the Denali Commission. USDA Farm Service Agency Executive State Director Danny Consenstein said, “Food security is a big issue in our rural areas.  Not only are fish and game important, but growing more local  produce can create jobs, healthier food, and more self-sufficient communities.  I’m excited to talk with and learn from tribal leaders about this important topic.” ""I look forward to participating in the collaborations and hearing directly from tribal leaders about what they need and expect from federal agencies.  It will be an opportunity to explain our programs and the assistance we can provide,” said Bob Jones, State Conservationist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Alaska Inter-Tribal Council (AITC) will be coordinating the logistics for the meetings.  The places and dates for the meeting will be determined by the tribes in consultation with AITC.

"Posted by Shannon O’Brien, Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 17,  The aftermath of ""mudders"" driving their vehicles through a pristine meadow on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest in Washington. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Mudders, take note: It is against the law to tear up forest roads and meadows for fun, and the legal and financial consequences can be steep. Tearing up high-country meadows with four-wheel-drive and off-road vehicles destroys wildlife habitat and ecosystems. During a recent investigation, Forest Service law enforcement officers gathered information about mudding that occurred over Memorial Day weekend on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest at Buck Lake Campground, near Winthrop, Wash. A meadow near the campground was torn up by vehicles. Where there was green grass there are now mud pits and tire tracks. The activities that caused this damage are illegal under both state and federal law. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. Smoothing ruts, reseeding or planting and repairing roadbeds cost a lot of money. Mudding, or driving through wet areas and puddles while mud sprays up onto a vehicle is considered fun by some motor sports enthusiasts. Some people enjoy the challenge of maneuvering a vehicle through a situation where they could get stuck, or they may simply get a thrill out of seeing how high they can fling mud. There are websites and groups that cater to this interest and there are places, mostly private land (with a landowners permission), where such activities are allowed. But a national forest is not such a place. The results of this incident on the Okanogan-Wenatchee are a familiar sight to natural resource specialists across the Forest Service. There is a difference between acceptable use of off-highway vehicles and mudding -- tearing through grass to expose underlying soil or unnecessarily driving through a soft spot in the road. Spinning tires on plants destroys the plants, leaving behind bare dirt. When plants are gone, there is nothing to stop soil from washing into nearby streams and lakes. Muddy streams and lakes are bad for fish, wildlife, irrigators and recreationists, and many local towns depend on clean water and tourism for survival. When native plants are gone, noxious weeds move in. A meadow of native grasses and flowers may soon become a field of thistles and knapweed. Believe it or not, mudding actually compacts soil. It’s hard for plants to grow in compacted soil. Healthy soil should bounce a bit when you walk on it. Tire tracks create hard, dried-up soil where water runs down tire tracks and into creeks and lakes, carrying mud and pollutants with it. Meadows and wetlands provide important breeding, rearing and foraging habitats for many birds and other animals. Tearing-up these areas removes nesting and hiding cover, decreases forage, interferes with feeding and pushes animals out into areas where they may not survive. Off-highway vehicles are permitted on designated trails within the National Forest System. These trails are built specifically to minimize the impact of vehicles on fragile ecosystems such as meadows and streams. Many trails are maintained by volunteers and are prime examples of citizens acting as stewards of public land.

"U.S. Forest Service, Florida in  Forestry  Mar 31,  A trail rider expert from Red Hills Powersports of Tallahassee, Fla., answers questions from a young boy from nearby Crawfordville, Fla., during the grand opening of the Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead. Forest Service engineers designed the recreational trailhead area to include spacious parking for visitors with trailers to offload motorcycles. (U.S. Forest Service Photo/Susan Blake) For many, the “great” in “the great outdoors” answers the call to hit the open road with body, soul and little else except their motorcycle. That got a little easier on the Apalachicola National Forest in Florida with the opening of a new trailhead beckoning riders with easier trail access and opportunity to ride for recreation. The grand opening of the new Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead south of Tallahassee, Fla., highlights the U.S. Forest Service policy to develop a system of roads, trails and areas designated for motor vehicle use. The project includes a new, single-span aluminum bridge to connect the forest’s separate motorized northern and southern trails. The prefabricated 90-foot Fisher Creek Bridge, shipped in two sections, replaces an older, antiquated bridge that stretched across the waterway. “Introducing a new recreation site to the area is very exciting. It’s a milestone for the forest but one we hope the public will enjoy for years,” said Chandra Roberts, recreation program manager for the forest. The Apalachicola saw the opportunity to create the new recreation area with a Recreational Trails Program (RTP) grant through the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The program provides financial assistance to develop recreational trails, trailheads and trailside facilities. “The $933,900 grant, funded by off-road vehicle fuel tax dollars through the Federal Highway Administration, has assisted the Forest Service in developing these facilities,” said Alex Weiss, Florida Department of Environmental Protection. “The Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead and Fisher Creek Bridge project, located in Leon County, exemplify the intent of RTP, which was created by Congress in .” Alex Weiss, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, discussed the benefits of the recently completed Springhill Motorcycle Trailhead on the Apalachicola National Forest to a crowd gathered for its grand opening. The new facility is a short distance from Tallahassee, Fla. (U.S. Forest Service Photo/Susan Blake) The Florida Forest Service also provided money through their T. Mark Schmidt Off-Highway Vehicle Safety and Recreation Act, which is designed to provide the public with more opportunities to ride off-highway vehicles on public lands. “Some people parked on the side of the highway and entered the trail, but now at this new facility there’s plenty of room to safely offload motorcycles and equipment before heading out on a ride,” said Steve Tomicich of the Tallahassee Trail Riders. Roberts said the Tallahassee Trail Riders, a local motorcycle club, and the Red Hills Powersports of Tallahassee promoted and participated in the grand opening and provided tips on trail riding. Local resident Jeff McKenzie was particularly grateful for the new trailhead. “I wanted to get a small motorcycle to ride with my kids, but we really didn’t have a place to ride,” McKenzie said.  “Now we have this new motorcycle trailhead and it’s really easy to get to.” A local motorcycle enthusiast runs one of the motorized trails on the Apalachicola National Forest near Tallahassee, Fla.

"Philly Market Rises Up to Meet Hunger Challenge  Did you know that nearly one-third of the food available to U.S. retailers and consumers never makes it to the dining room table?  That’s 133 billion pounds of food going to waste--all of which has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation, and climate change.  Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That’s why my agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.  Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away.  While these fresh foods weren’t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn’t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 12,  Western Slope ATV Association work party on Young’s Connector . Photo credit: US Forest Service Your face is dusty. Your All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) is muddy. Your adrenaline is at an all-time high. You have just finished riding one of your favorite trails on the U.S. Forest Service’s Grand Mesa National Forest and couldn’t be happier. But, do you ever wonder how all these miles of off-highway vehicle, or OHV, trails traversing a vast and diverse landscape stay in good shape? The fact is forests across the nation have the annual challenge of maintaining hundreds of miles of trails with limited budgets and personnel. One such example of this national trails preservation effort is happening on the Grand Valley Ranger District. The district, along with the thousands of recreational trail users who frequent the Grand Mesa, benefit greatly from outside funding sources such as the state of Colorado OHV Grant Program and numerous partnerships with local groups and associations that help maintain their system trails. Partnerships have been instrumental in the maintenance and improvement of the many recreational opportunities on the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests. The Grand Valley Ranger District currently has partnerships with ten different organizations that volunteer to help clear trail corridors, conduct volunteer trail patrols and organize work parties to help with specific projects. These partners have been essential not only in providing thousands of hours of help each year to maintain trails but, have been able to leverage and acquire additional monies to help fund trail improvement projects on the forest. One such project completed during the season was the Young’s Connector Trail , located on the Grand Mesa. The Western Slope ATV Association volunteered many hours clearing the trail corridor and the Forest Service’s trail dozer crew, funded by a state OHV grant, built the new one mile trail linking two routes, and creating a 15-mile loop opportunity. In addition to funds for specific projects, the Forest Service receives annual funding under a Good Management Grant that allows the Grand Valley Ranger District to hire two OHV crews, totaling 4 people, throughout the summer and fall when motorized use is at its peak. So now, armed with a little more background on what goes on with the care and upkeep of your motorized trails on the Grand Mesa National Forest, get out and enjoy another ride!

The Alsea were a tribe of Native Americans who, for thousands of years, lived along the central Oregon Coast. In anthropologist Livingston Farrand predicted their loss in “Notes on the Alsea Indians of Oregon.” On June 1, the City of Yachats, a small coastal city in Oregon, joined with the U.S. Forest Service and Oregon State Parks to celebrate National Trails Day with a variety of activities, including the dedication of the new Ya’Xaik (pronounced yäh' khīk) Trail. The trail is named for the only known village of the Alsea people who originally inhabited the area. This trail is the result of many years of collaborative planning between the City of Yachats, the Siuslaw National Forest, area land owners and many citizen volunteers. The newest leg of the trail, completed in April, enables hikers to complete just over a one mile loop from the historic 804 trail north along the ocean, through the Gerdemann Botanic Preserve and across Siuslaw National Forest land. The Yachats Trails Committee hopes to one day extend a link into downtown Yachats. Mary-Beth Nickel performs during the trail’s dedication. U.S. Forest Service photo. “Trails, and the environments they traverse, have both economic and symbolic importance,” Mayor Ron Brean said. “Trails connect communities, they bridge cultures and they can connect the past and the future.” “The City of Yachats is especially grateful to the Siuslaw National Forest, Angell Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center and the many land owners and tireless volunteers who have assisted with creation of this outstanding resource that will benefit residents and visitors for years to come.” “For years we have truly valued our partnership with the community of Yachats,” said Michele Jones, district ranger for the Central Coast District and Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. “These energetic people have made many hiking opportunities come alive for those visitors exploring Cape Perpetua and Yachats.” The overall theme for this year’s National Trails Day celebration was “interpretation” and, in addition to the dedication, the day provided a number of opportunities for visitors to learn more about the natural, historical and cultural stories of the area. Visitors learned how Alsea Indians used spoons called Meixat made from elk antlers. They also commonly used clamshell cups and ate out of maple bowls made only by the men of the tribe.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 14,  Snowmelt on Mount Hood sends ample water down a stream in Oregon. NRCS photo. April storms delivered a mix of rain and snow to the northern half of the West but didn’t provide much relief for the dry southern half, according to the latest USDA water supply forecast. Washington, most of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and the northern parts of Colorado and Utah, are expected to have near normal or above normal water supplies, according to the forecasts from the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s National Water and Climate Center (NWCC).  Streamflows that are far below normal are forecast for the southern parts of Oregon and Utah, southwestern Idaho, California, Arizona, New Mexico and western Nevada. Many of these areas are in the nearly 500 counties experiencing drought across the country, 57 of them in California alone, according to USDA disaster designations. Snowpack generally peaks in early April, and then begins to melt. Forecasters will continue to monitor conditions in preparation for the June 1 outlook, according to NWCC hydrologist Cara McCarthy. She said the rate of snowmelt in Montana and Wyoming will be especially important, because the record snow in some basins in those areas creates flooding potential. ""These areas will be most vulnerable if snow melts rapidly during a hot spell, or if there's extreme rain while the streams are swollen with snowmelt,” McCarthy said. “We’re hoping for a slow, consistent melt that will reduce the risk of flooding.” Streamflow in the West consists largely of accumulated mountain snow that melts and flows into streams as temperatures warm into spring and summer. USDA scientists analyze the snowpack, air temperature, soil moisture and other measurements taken from remote sites to develop the water supply forecasts. The NWCC water supply forecast is part of a group of USDA efforts to improve public awareness of and to help mitigate the impacts of climate change, including drought and other extreme weather events.  Through the creation of the National Drought Resilience Partnership, launched as part of the President’s Climate Action Plan, federal agencies are working closely with states, tribes and local government to develop a coordinated response to drought.

In Smithville, Miss. the senior administration officials were joined by Mississippi’s USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George, who had made the trek from her home in central Mississippi in the pre-dawn hours on Thursday, the day after the tornado hit. State Director George viewed damaged areas in Maben, Amory, and parts of Chickasaw County on Thursday. She had monitored the tornado, keeping in contact with local officials as the tornado went through Mississippi on Wednesday. She linked up on Thursday morning with local USDA personnel in Oktibbeha County, arriving only hours after the tornado had passed through. She also toured damaged areas in Neshoba and Kemper Counties that afternoon. Secretary Tom Vilsack toured the area of Smithville, Mississippi and saw firsthand the heavy damage caused by the tornado.

Secretary Vilsack and State Director George were two of a number of Obama Administration Cabinet officials, federal administrators, and local leaders to see the damage caused by tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama. “It is heartbreaking to see this damage and to talk to the people who are victims of the tornado,” said George. “I was able to not only see the physical damages, but I was able to listen to some of the actual victims, many of whom had lost everything. However, I can report that USDA Rural Development has programs that can offer some relief to these unfortunate victims.” George cited USDA Rural Development programs such as funding to replace and repair single-family homes, shared community facilities and the water and wastewater systems in the damaged areas. “I want to make sure that people know about the availability of our programs, especially our single-family home loan and home repair loan programs, so that they can rebuild their homes and businesses and continue to have clean water.” George has a history of fast action on disaster relief. Most recently, she was on the scene the day after tornadoes ran thru Holmes and Yazoo Counties in and made sure that USDA Rural Development programs were a part of both the immediate and long-term relief efforts in those counties. Local officials in both counties credited George and USDA Rural Development for their fast work in making resources available, especially to the homeowners who lost their homes in that disaster. “These people have lost everything but their spirit. For them to see the highest officials in our nation’s government, including Cabinet secretaries and head of relief agencies coming to what is left of their town to see the damage personally,” Said George, “I can’t convey to ya’ll how uplifting that is to those people.

"Secretary's Column: Skyrocketing Fire Costs  Over the past twenty years, a changing climate, population growth near forests and rangelands, and the buildup of brush and other fuels have dramatically increased the severity of wildfires and the damage that they cause to our natural lands and communities.

Between and , the average annual number of fires on Federal land more than doubled, and the total area burned annually tripled. Even as fire seasons have grown, the way we pay to fight these fires remains unchanged – and fundamentally broken. The Forest Service’s firefighting appropriation has rapidly increased as a proportion of the Forest Service’s overall budget, increasing from 16 percent in to 42 percent today. As the costs of wildfires have spiraled out of control, it has shrunk the budget of other Forest Service programs, taking millions of dollars from other critical forest health and land management priorities in order to pay for them.

It was established to supply the thousands of prospectors headed to Bidwell Bar, one of the first gold rush mines in the state. Today, this community of 16,260 people produces much more than just gold dust. At the edge of town, what started in as a backyard blacksmith shop by owners Michael Phulps and Sean Pierce has become a 82-employee steel manufacturing company called Metal Works, thanks to a little help from USDA Rural Development. Fourteen years ago, Metal Works received their first Business & Industry loan guarantee to purchase a 20,000 square foot fabrication shop and office building on a little over 18 acres. Since then, they’ve converted their original 9,400 square foot building to a retail steel shop, and added another 20,000 square foot fabrication shop, burn table, and a modern, high-precision drill and beam line. Now, they’ve leveraged a new Rural Development guaranteed loan to refinance, save tens of thousands of dollars annually, and hire 10 new employees as a direct result of those savings.

"USDA Photographer, Office of Communications in  Initiatives  Aug 30,   A day in the life of a U.S. Department of Agriculture photojournalist is never the same. This one was no exception. It started out testing a new memory card that transmits photos from a digital camera to our Flickr social media gallery (www.USDA.gov and click the Flickr link).  After making the card work in the office , a field test was in order. Sunflowers in the People's Garden at the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, DC. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung. The nearest field was the Native American Garden, one of the two People's Garden fields just outside Whitten Building. My task was simple enough, take some pretty photos of corn and see if technology does it's magic. As soon as I take the first photo of what it thought were two big fat healthy ears of corn  I hear voices behind me on the sidewalk, ""Look at that, they're past their harvest."" Mature corn on the stalk in the People's Garden at the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, DC. USDA Media by Lance Cheung So, me being a ""city-boy"" had to turnaround and see who was making these comments about these ""perfect"" ears of corn. Turns out a mother and young teenaged son were walking from one tourist site to another, and stopped to looking up at the rows of 9-foot stalks. Their voices were confident and seemed to speak from experience as they continued, ""They waited too long.""  The young man was still nearby, while the mom continued past the garden watching our conversation. When asked how they made such deft evaluation, he easily pointed out the brown lower portions of the stalk and the yellowing upper half. Corn stalks that some passersby said was past their harvest time in downtown Washington, DC at the Department of Agriculture. The yellow and brown leaves were telltale signs of a spent stalk and hot dry summer days. USDA Photo by Lance Cheung.  A closer look at other ears of corn, revealed corncobs kernels that were picked away by birds. What kernels that remained, were simply dried out in the sun, because the husk was picked away. In the next moment, the boy was gone, before I could get names or a photo. What he didn't know and I had forgotten, was that the Three Sisters crop, in this demonstration garden, was keeping with Native American tradition. The type of corn planted is Dent Corn or field corn.  Not the kind most of us are used to seeing on a dinner plate. In fact, Dent Corn must be ground or further processed to be usable. And, unlike its sister crops of beans and squash, it is not suitable for donation to local food banks. Please see photos and info from the day the plants were planted on our Flickr site. So, corn stalks are not all the same. Just as, their harvest times are not all the same. With this crop, birds get a free meal, the stalks will become holiday decorations; and visiting groups to passers-by get to see living American heritage growing before them. All in all, the young (hopefully) future farmer was inspiring. I was left recalling the voice of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, as he often speaks about the value the next generation of farmers, who are they; what will be their motivation; where will they get help if needed in a world whose population is increasing, and the number of farmers are decreasing. Today, I met one young man that might be part of the answer.

"Director of the AMS Agricultural Analytics Division in  Food and Nutrition  Feb 03,  Infographic of Super Bowl & chicken wing facts. Click for a larger version. On January 15, , the Green Bay Packers faced off against the Kansas City Chiefs in the very first Super Bowl.  On that day, few of the estimated ates.  The Packers won the game 35-10, but ultimately the real winner was chicken – particularly wings. In , Americans consumes 32.6 pounds of chicken per capita, typically purchased in whole-bird form.  Cuts of chicken were a novelty at the grocery story, and there was little demand for chicken wings.  But, in , the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, N.Y. decided to turn the typical soup-stock staple into a spicy finger food to feed a hungry crowd. For a few years after they first served them, wings gained popularity in the bar scene—then came Super Bowl I, turning them into a sporting event tradition.  Since that first game, chicken wings have become a staple of football gatherings and tailgaters, even carrying over into other major sporting events with the annual college basketball tournaments and the college and pro football season rivaling the big game for wing consumption. In fact, any big sporting event that generates a crowd increases demand for chicken wings. On the day of Super Bowl I, the wholesale price for chicken wings on the New York market was 23 cents per pound. Today, chicken consumption is estimated at 90.1 pounds, a 176 percent increase from .  This past week, chicken wings averaged 197 cents per pound, a 743 percent increase.  At current prices, wings account for nearly a quarter of the whole bird value! In , the U.S. chicken industry produced around 28.5 billion chicken wing portions – the drumette and flat portions of the wing, which excludes the tip portion that is typically exported.  At least 5.6 percent of those chicken wing portions were marketed during the week leading up to the big game. That’s 1.6 billion chicken wing portions flying through the fingers of eager football fans across the nation! A similar volume is expected to move for this year’s big game. With an estimated viewership of nearly 115 million, that’s about 14 wings per viewer. A lot has changed for chicken since that fateful day in . But one thing has not – they still only come with two wings!

"NRCS Idaho in  Conservation  Mar 02,  This sign is posted at all officials snow course sites. Once a month in winter and spring, snow surveyors from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) head for the hills to measure the mountain snowpack. These trained observers ski, snowshoe or snowmobile to established snow measurement courses to record snow the old fashioned way – by hand. In 12 western states, NRCS employees measure the mountain snowpack each month from January to June at over 900 snow courses. NRCS uses snow and climate to forecast water supplies – did you know up to 80 percent of the West’s water supply comes from melting mountain snow?  Today we’re going to snowshoe into the Mores Creek site, near Boise, Idaho. At four stops along this 1,000-foot-long snow course we will measure the snow. Then, doing some quick calculations, we can determine how much water the snowpack contains. By the way: snow courses are usually located in remote backcountry locations where snowfall accumulates. Because the work can be dangerous, the technicians, hydrologists, engineers and volunteers that serve as snow surveyors attend training every three to five years to maintain their survival skills. At “Snow School” they learn snow sampling, avalanche recognition, outdoor survival and backcountry emergency care. They even build snow shelters and spend the night in them! To measure the snow we use an official Federal Snow Sampling tube which is an eight-foot long hollow tube precisely 1.485 inches in diameter. That’s so 1 ounce of tube weight exactly equals 1 inch of snow water equivalent. The tube is plunged straight down through the snow to the ground to get the sample. First we measure the snow depth using the ruler on the tube. Abramovich reads the snow depth using the gauge on the tube. Then we carefully extract the tube with a snow core and weigh it – tube, snow and all. Subtracting the empty tube weight from the tube and snow weight reveals how much water is in the snow. This is used to accurately forecast spring runoff and predict summer water supplies. Good job – you’ve now measured the snowpack! Abramovich balances the tube on the scale to get the weight of the tube and snow sample. Besides these manually measured snow courses, NRCS maintains 800 automated sites (called SNOTEL for SNOw TELemetry) that collect snow, precipitation and temperature available on NRCS Web pages. The are used by hydrologists, planners, engineers and others to manage water supplies for industry, cities, recreation and wildlife. For over 100 years, snowpack has been collected to forecast agricultural water supplies in the West – thanks for helping carry on the tradition! Snow surveyor Ron Abramovich, checks the snow survey tube to make sure it’s empty before taking the next measurement.

The opening marked completion of the 500th water and environmental project completed by USDA through the Recovery Act. USDA photo. USDA Rural Utilities Service Administrator John Padalino recently visited the 500th water and wastewater project completed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of . ""The Recovery Act has brought improved water and wastewater services to nearly 1.7 million rural residents,” said the Administrator. Administrator Padalino made his remarks at the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority Treatment Plant in Arkansas. Most people in the U.S. take for granted the fact that safe drinking water is readily available for use by simply turning on a tap, or pushing a button on a fountain.  However, many rural communities within the U.S. must deal with negative impacts associated with contaminated water sources at their homes and schools. In fact, since the ’s there have been efforts to bring safe drinking water to Boone, Newton, and Searcy counties in Arkansas.  Groundwater in this region is often contaminated with naturally occurring random, radium, and fluoride, which water systems must address.   Contaminated ground water is unsafe and unfit for humans to use. USDA funding for the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority system is used to provide clean, safe water for over 20,000 residents and businesses. In addition to the USDA funding, the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission provided nearly $10 million for the project. Programs like the one which funded the Treatment Plant would not be available without a Food, Farm and Jobs Bill. Rural areas need safe and reliable water for the health of their communities and sustainable economic growth. Since the start of the Obama Administration, USDA has invested more than $218 million, in over 100 water and wastewater programs in rural Arkansas alone.

"Addressing California’s Water Challenges Through Action and Collaboration  Cross posted from DOI News: California is in the throes of the worst drought in the 160 years during which records have been kept. As a result, the state’s overextended water system is in crisis. All segments of California’s economy— one of the largest in the world—are experiencing the effects of this drought. The economic, social and environmental impacts on agriculture, industry, jobs, communities’ drinking water and the ecosystem will reverberate across the country, and that is why actions need to be taken to address the situation not just in the short term, but also to sustain the state over the long run. Following two years of dry conditions, on January 17, California Governor Jerry Brown proclaimed a State of Emergency for drought. Subsequently, the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, and Commerce have committed to helping California prepare for and lessen drought impacts. In addition, as called for in President Obama’s Climate Action Plan, the National Drought Resilience Partnership, which includes the Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Commerce (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Energy, will help align federal resources and policies to better support response to drought impacts and build long term sustainability and resilience in California’s water system.

"Rural  Research and Science  Jun 16,   Worcester Prep, Berlin, MarylandThe upgrades currently taking place at the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant are comprehensive, and will allow the plant to fully process all the wastewater that goes through the system down to near drinking water quality.  The technology that the Town of Berlin, MD is installing was made possible thanks to a grant and some low interest Water and Environmental Program loans from the USDA.  These upgrades will help to remove the pathogens, nutrients and other pollutants from the influent. Technology that is being installed as part of these upgrades is called a SBR or sequencing batch reactor.  I recently spoke with Jane Kreiter, Director of Water and Wastewater for the Town of Berlin, about this new technology and got a look at the lab where the Berlin wastewater officials monitor every stage of the treatment for specific criteria. The new SBRs being installed at Berlin’s wastewater plant will all work in essentially the same way:  there will be three different SBR tanks installed as part of the ongoing upgrades, and Kreiter says that these will contain different amounts and kinds of bacteria to break down certain types of “bad” nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous.  Giant blowers at the bottom of each tank blow varying amounts of oxygen into the tanks, causing the oxygen to slowly bubble to the top.  The oxygen is needed to maintain the biomass inside the tank so that they can be healthy and break down and remove the various constituents in the waste stream.  When the bacteria are young in the biomass, they consume and break down a lot of the nitrogen and phosphorous, but as they begin to get older, they become full and less efficient at breaking down nutrients.  When this happens, they die and fall to the bottom of the SBR.  The dead bacteria are then removed from the bottom of the tank by way of a pump assembly and sent to a digester.  The amount of bacteria and oxygen in the SBR must be constantly monitored to ensure that the right amount of contaminants will be removed at each stage of the treatment process inside the SBR. After the influent has gone through the entire treatment process it is ready to be sent to the spray irrigation site in Libertytown, Maryland.  Samples of the treated effluent are collected as they are leaving the plant and are taken to the lab.  Kreiter was embarrassed to take me inside the cramped, temporary lab that is located inside the mobile trailer they are currently using while the regular lab is being renovated.  She assured me that this was not what the lab normally looks like and asked to “make sure to come back when we get our new lab,” which will be opening when the rest of the upgrades are completed on site.  In the lab they test for pathogens, nutrients, total suspended solids, PH levels, and biological oxygen demand. The upgrades to the Berlin wastewater plant, when completed, will break down nutrients and contaminants in the influent to create near drinking water quality effluent. “It’s a better quality than [the water] a lot people get out of their wells,” Jane Kreiter adds.  For a 24-hour time-lapse video of part of the Berlin Wastewater Plant SBR installation, you can visit the following links: for Part 1 and for Part 2.

Photo: Amy Overstreet Rwanda native Janine Ndagijimana, her husband Faustine and their children moved to Burlington, Vermont in after living in a refugee camp in Tanzania for 13 years. Now a U.S. citizen, she works closely with Ben Waterman, the New American Farmer Program coordinator at the University of Vermont Extension Service (UVM) Center for Sustainable Agriculture. He manages the Land Access and Assessment Program that helps Vermont's resettled refugee and immigrant farmers obtain access to the resources they need to pursue their goals as farmers and to link common threads between their new home in America the culture of their homelands. Janine was one of several farmers who recently attended a meeting of the Association of Africans Living in Vermont to learn about USDA programs and services. Farmers from Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo learned about land acquisition, insurance programs, loans to support farming, and technical and financial assistance for implementing conservation farming practices. Waterman coordinates a project from USDA’s Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Program (OASDVFR), administered through USDA’s Office of Advocacy and Outreach. The $43,000 grant is helping Vermont refugee farmers improve their understanding of programs and technical assistance available through UVM Extension and USDA agencies. “We want to help these individuals, like Janine, build strong working relationships within the community and link them with the many resources that are available to them from the University and USDA,” said Waterman. UVM Extension outreach includes two workshops with translators on-hand assisting refugee farmers as they learn more about the programs and services of USDA’s Farm Service Agency (FSA) and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Farmers are then matched with an appropriate USDA representative to help them meet their individual goals and needs. Many of the farmers are interested in the kinds of vegetables they grew up with and raised in their home countries, like “intore,” a variety of eggplant found in Africa that Janine grows. Of course, the climate in Vermont is very different from that of Africa, where eggplants could be harvested through January. Thanks to technical and financial assistance through the NRCS Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Janine will be able to extend her growing season in Vermont using a high tunnel. High tunnels, also known as hoop houses, are structures used to extend the growing season by shielding tender, sensitive crops—including vegetables, herbs, berries and others—from weather variations in the spring and fall, allowing them to grow where they might otherwise struggle. With the assistance and mentorship of local farmer Gene Button, Janine is leasing land to raise her eggplants and market them locally and across the border in Canada. NRCS Soil Conservationist Danny Peet is also helping her use cover crops to improve soil health. “The high tunnel allows production from mid-summer until later in the fall,” said Peet. He assisted Janine with the process of submitting the EQIP application, securing the lease for the acreage and locating the appropriate area to construct the high tunnel. It can be a challenge to provide outreach and education to farmers for whom English is a second language. To help address this, another goal of the grant is to educate farmers through instructional videos in several languages. The first up provides an Introduction to USDA Programs for New American Farmers featuring USDA staff. “A realistic outcome for the outreach meetings and the video is relationship building.”  Waterman said. “Translation is key.” Farmers can view the English and Kirundi versions of the video and Nepali and Maay Maay versions are in production. The educational and technical assistance content is designed to address barriers that resettled refugee farmers commonly face.

Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Mar 05,  Amy Merrit of Oso, Wash., and Kim Woodward of Darrington, Wash., work on maintaining the Pacific Crest Trail on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest in Washington. (U.S. Forest Service photo) If you’re a student who likes fresh air, scenic vistas, hiking and camping, the U.S. Forest Service might have the perfect job for you. This year, some units of the Forest Service have been hosting one-day recruiting fairs that teach high school and college students how to apply for upcoming summer jobs with the government. In one example, about 30 hopeful candidates met in downtown Seattle. Staffers from the Forest Service taught students tips to make a resume shine and how to ace an interview. The session also gave the hopefuls an opportunity to develop professional relationships and networking with potential employers. During the meeting, students who have worked for the Forest Service shared their experiences working as guides, building trails or fighting fires. Nik Vasquez, 21, of Seattle, talked about working on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest for three summers where he began on a trail crew. Nik Vasquez, 21, of Seattle, worked on the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest for three summers. (U. S. Forest Service photo) Vasquez worked 10-hour days maintaining trails, removing fallen trees, fixing water drainage, repairing trail paths and brushing out shrubs and branches. His typical work week began by backpacking five to seven miles to the trail, setting up a base camp, accessing damage and clearing away downed trees or branches. “You quickly learn how to use a Pulaski, a shovel and a grub hoe, to fix the trails,” said Vasquez. “I love being out there. It is the simple things: fresh air, mountain lakes, fishing for dinner, exploring mountain peaks, relaxing by the fire. Working outside is better than a 9-to-5 job.” During Vasquez’s second year on the Forest Service trail crew he began training to fight wildfires. The next year he was selected for a position on an initial attack crew. His stint on the trail crew gave Vasquez the training but didn’t quite prepare him for the long hours needed to fight fires. His most memorable experience was fighting the Waldo Canyon Fire in Colorado Springs last year. “At a fire assignment you work long days, and you can be gone for months,” he said. But one of the bonuses for working on the fire crew is the pay, which he is using to pay for his college tuition. Vasquez is now majoring in engineering and physics at Loyola University in New Orleans, La. This summer he will take a break to return home and hike the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, a trail he learned about from those summer jobs. “There are so many peaks I want to climb along the way,” he said. Annually, the Forest Service and its conservation partners hire more than 3,000 people for summer positions that involve work such as reducing the impacts of climate change on the nation’s natural resources, empowering Native American communities, building trails, enhancing wildlife habitat, and improving and restoring cultural and historic landmarks.

"USDA Assistant Secretary for Administration in  Conservation  Initiatives  Farming  Rural  Nov 15,  Ribbon Cutting for the Socially Disadvantage Farmers and Ranchers Policy Research Center at Alcorn State University Day in, day out, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) brings programs to many farmers and ranchers as well as opportunities to students. As I meet with farmers, ranchers and USDA interns, a sense of great appreciation and anticipation wells up for the future of agriculture. One of the USDA offices that serves these farmers and students is the Office of Advocacy and Outreach (OAO). OAO staff connect with farmers, community organizers, veterans, educators and students to bring opportunities and services. OAO works with community-based organizations to ensure access to USDA programs and services for underserved and limited-resource communities and farmers. A major program is the Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Program (also known as the Program).  Forty-five projects from organizations representing 25 States were awarded $8.8 million in . This included a second year of $400,ate University. Among the program grantees are Robert Gates and Clay Taylor, President and Agribusiness Specialist at the Tri-County Agricultural Cooperative (Tri-County Co-op) in Mississippi. The co-op serves approximately 45 small, socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers – 80 percent of whom are under the age of 40.  “Thanks to the program, we are able to do one-on-one work with farmers,” said Gates. “We can spend quality time doing the research they need and training them on marketing practices.”  Taylor added, “The program allows rural individuals to turn family-owned property and rural towns into economic spaces and income generators. In the south we have a lot of space that is underused in terms of agriculture, especially sustainable agriculture. This program helps small, beginning, and socially disadvantaged farmers to unlock the hidden potential of agriculture.” In September , OAO organized the second annual Program Partnership Symposium. I spoke to the group along with officials from Farm Service Agency, Rural Development and Natural Resources Conservation Service emphasizing the importance of leveraging USDA programs to strengthen outreach and services. Among the 300 participants in two years was Robert Gates of Tri-County Co-op who that both meetings where great opportunities to network with other grantees and university and community partners. Minority Farmers Advisory Committee OAO manages two critical advisory committees to the Secretary -- the Minority Farmers Advisory Committee and the Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Advisory Committee. Both committees provide recommendations to enhance USDA programs. This year, OAO coordinated the USDA/Task Force meeting attended by a record number of Presidents, Agriculture Deans, and Research Directors.  Among the objectives was to continue work on the Centers of Excellence which promote and expand USDA’s partnership with the Land-Grant Universities. USDA agencies have provided $1.6 million to the Centers. OAO also ensures that the National Scholars Program places top students across USDA.  If you are a student or know of any students who would like to apply for the National Scholars Program, please download the application and submit it to USDA by the December 31, deadline. USDA also partners with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) to provide internships and this year, USDA increased the number to 117 TMCF interns. I am fortunate to have TMCF interns working in my office and one of those is Jay Coleman, a graduate of Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, LA. “Interning at the USDA has been eye-opening, and has allowed me to put my Juris Doctor to use,” Coleman said. “I have been given the opportunity to use skills obtained in law school to assist in implementing technological advances in the Office of the Assistant Secretary.” In , USDA hosted 222 Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities interns and set a record. The E. Kika De La Garza Fellowship Program offers faculty and staff from Hispanic Serving Institutions the opportunity to work with USDA to gain an understanding of the Federal government. In , ates and 12 universities. OAO staff also leads the USDA Tribal Land-Grant Colleges and Universities Program serving the Tribal Colleges which includes 34 tribal land-grant institutions. With these OAO services in as well as over the past several years, USDA made great strides in addressing barriers faced by minority and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. To further strengthen and elevate this engagement with historically underrepresented communities, OAO now will report directly to the Office of the Secretary. The realignment highlights the critical importance of OAO’s mission and function, and also demonstrates USDA’s commitment to maintaining the momentum in addressing long-standing challenges.  This action also will create transparent lines of accountability and authority, and better facilitate oversight and coordination throughout USDA. The Department will continue to strengthen its outreach to customers on programs and services that support agricultural interests and rural communities -- the future of agriculture depends on it.   Category/Topic:  Conservation  Initiatives  Farming  Rural  Tags:  National Scholars Program  USDA/Task Force  Tribal Land-Grant-Colleges and Universities Program  Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Advisory Committee  Farm Service Agency  Minority Farmers Advisory Committee  Natural Resources Conservation Service  Office of Advocacy and Outreach  Rural Development","What USDA program, managed by the Office of Advocacy and Outreach (OAO), provides grants to organizations serving socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers?","The USDA program that provides grants to organizations serving socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers is called the ""Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged and Veteran Farmers and Ranchers Program"" (also known as the Program)."
"NRCS Wisconsin in  Conservation  Jan 26,  Some bees are specialists that only pollinate certain plants. This squash bee works the Cucurbita crops—squash and pumpkins. (Photo courtesy of Nancy Adamson and the Xerces Society) A recently awarded USDA Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) will fund research into bee-friendly seed mixes. A partnership made up of the Xerces Society, University of Wisconsin Center for Integrated Agriculture Systems and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service in Wisconsin is working to develop and test seed mixes that will provide the best habitat for native bees. CIG-funded projects use innovative technologies and approaches to address natural resources issues. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants depend on pollinators to reproduce, and in the U.S., bees are the main pollinators of fruits and vegetables. But bees, bats and other pollinators are struggling as habitat loss, disease, parasites, and environmental contaminants have all contributed to the decline of many species of pollinators, including the more than 4,000 species of native bees in North America. To ensure that bees and other pollinators don’t just survive, but also thrive, USDA programs provide funding and technical assistance for farmers to implement pollinator-friendly practices on their lands. One important practice is incorporating plantings that attract native bees and other pollinators to the borders of fields and other areas and feed them a varied diet throughout the year. Providing healthy habitat for native bees will also help feed managed hives of European honey bees—which are used to pollinate many commercial crops in the U.S.—and make them heartier, as they too reap the benefits of a diverse and healthy diet. Not long ago, Wisconsin was home to 13 species of bumble bee. Now, two of the most common bumblebees are no longer found here, due to habitat loss and environmental contaminants. (Photo courtesy of Hannah Gaines from UW-Madison Entomology Dept.) That’s where bee-friendly seed mixes come in. Four half-acre demonstration sites have been planted using the new seed mixes in field borders and buffer areas: on apple and fresh vegetable farms, a cranberry operation, and a cucumber-and-pepper farm. The first results will be seen this summer, when scientists will observe how quickly and successfully the new plantings establish themselves, and how quickly the bees return. Getting the right seed mix to attract and sustain a healthy native bee population is a challenge. Bees need flowers—but not just any flowers. They need to be the right color and size, and bloom at the right times. Bees are attracted to white, yellow, blue or purple flowers. Bees also need a variety of sizes, ranging from big sturdy flowers for the bumble bees to small delicate ones for the sweat bees. Timing is also important—for example, bees need some flowers to be steadily in bloom from the time the bees first crawl out of their winter nests in early spring until they go back in late fall.

"APHIS Public Affairs Specialist in  Animals  Plants  Jul 11,  A gypsy moth caterpillar on a leaf in Massachusetts While being outside in Massachusetts this June, I first noticed it.  A lot of leaves were falling from the trees, only these were chewed leaf parts, not whole leaves. Similar to the children's book, The Very Hungry Caterpillar written by Eric Carle, some leaves didn’t just have chew marks but actual holes going straight through them.  Unlike the children’s book, this damage isn’t being caused by a friendly caterpillar who turns into a butterfly.  Instead it’s the result of ravenous gypsy moth caterpillars feeding…and feeding.  It’s so bad that in some areas, on walkways and roadways, it looks like fall.  Brown, dried up leaves are a contrast to summer’s lush greenery. What comes along with all the feeding and falling leaf parts?  Caterpillar feces, everywhere.  It too covers walkways and roadways.  And you don’t have to listen hard to hear the feeding, or the leaves and feces dropping.  The chewing is constant and so are the droppings.  It almost sounds like rain falling, continuously.  I regret that I did not take a picture of a car covered with caterpillar feces that I saw at the grocery store this weekend, which looked like it had peppercorns stuck all over it.  Don’t park under a tree, or like everything else, your car will be covered. Gypsy moth is not everywhere in the United States.  It’s primarily in the northeast to mid-west, and it’s Federal and State agriculture officials’ goal to not let it spread further.  You can do your part to help by finding out if you are in an area that already has gypsy moth, and if you’re not, report any gypsy moth egg masses or caterpillars on trees to Federal or State agriculture officials.  Also, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is asking folks to check for gypsy moth before you move to a new area by inspecting your outdoor household articles (lawn furniture, yard equipment, outdoor toys, etc.) for gypsy moth egg masses and remove them.  It's not just the right thing to do—it's also the law. And now it’s easier than ever because APHIS just made its gypsy moth inspection checklist a fillable (page 2 of our gypsy moth factsheet) that can be digitally signed, making it acceptable in all situations where the form is . The gypsy moth caterpillars here in Massachusetts are ruining thousands of trees, changing the way the landscape looks.  The crabapple tree I planted two years ago didn’t bloom this year, and it may not survive these gypsy moth caterpillar attacks.  Please help prevent this insect from moving to other areas by visiting www.HungryPests.com to learn more about gypsy moth and other invasive pests we don’t want in the United States. Gypsy moths can lay their masses on just about any outdoor item—like this lawnmower—which people could move to uninfested areas, accidentally causing great harm.

"NRCS Utah in  Conservation  Jun 04,  Roger Barton’s center pivot irrigation system is running on green renewable energy. The hydroturbine system was funded by NRCS in Utah through a Conservation Innovation Grant. Photo credit Roger Barton. Like other farmers in the West, Roger Barton must irrigate the alfalfa hay he raises for horse owners. And like many farmers, Barton has to be creative to make ends meet. He has an off-farm job to support his family and is always trying to think of ways to keep his farm costs down. When diesel costs rose to $4.25 per gallon a couple of years ago, Barton came up with a new, non-diesel-powered way to power his center pivot irrigation system, which creates those crop circles you may have noticed when flying over rural America. (The center pivot also saves lots of water by spreading just the right amount evenly over the land.) With the help of a Conservation Innovation Grant from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Barton worked with a pump company and NRCS engineers to design a hydroturbine system that generates electricity to power his pivot irrigation system. CIG-funded projects use innovative technologies and approaches to address natural resources issues. A close up view of Roger Barton’s hydroturbine system which generates electricity to power a pivot irrigation system on a 127 acre alfalfa field in Utah. Photo credit Roger Barton.  Irrigation water in his area is delivered from the mountains in a pressurized pipe at about 85 pounds per square inch (psi)—about twice as much as needed. In the past, this caused some damage to Barton’s sprinkler heads. Now when the water enters his new system it travels through the vanes of the turbine (Fig. 1), causing the turbine to spin and turn a hydraulic pump that pumps hydraulic fluid through gears that turn the wheels, moving the long irrigation boom around the circle. Along the way the water pressure is reduced to about 45 psi, just the right amount to keep it from damaging the sprinkler heads. This system is terrific,” Barton says. “It not only did away with a $3,500 annual fuel bill, but it eliminates emissions from the old motor, avoids storing fuel on the farm and lessens our dependence on foreign sources of oil. I’d say that’s a win-win for everybody. The turbine runs a 127 acre T-L hydraulic pivot and it is still running like a charm in its fourth year of operation.” NRCS State Engineer Bronson Smart estimates the annual operating cost of the new turbine system to be less than $100.Barton has shared information about his system with neighbors, and his ideas, developed with the USDA grant, have been adopted into the NRCS standard practices list approved for use on other farms participating in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP).

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Forest Service, Fire and Aviation Management in  Forestry  Animals  Plants  Jan 12,  USDA Forest Service Smokejumpers are trained to climb trees in case they, or their supplies, land in them. When Smokejumpers aren’t fighting wildfires, the USDA Forest Service calls on them to use their tree climbing skills to complete a variety of natural resource management projects, such as harvesting pine cones and constructing owl nesting boxes.  While many USDA Forest Service employees spend their summers working as Smokejumpers fighting wildfires in the west, they in turn spend their falls in the east working as Beetle Busters, helping the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) combat the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB). Since these nonnative insects were first discovered in Brooklyn, New York in , the  ALB has caused tens of thousands of trees to be destroyed in Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. They  feed- and develop deep inside certain species of hardwood trees, weakening and eventually killing them. To stop the destruction from furthering, Smokejumpers soon began working as ""tree climbers"" to help APHIS identify trees infested with ALB. Smokejumpers are highly trained, skilled, and experienced wild land firefighters – taking their past expertise, and putting it to use saving trees from another grave danger: the Asian longhorned beetle. While climbing, these Forest Service employees seek out dime-sized holes that indicate the presence of the destructive ALB in tree canopies soaring over ten stories high. Once the infested trees are recorded on a GPS unit, they are ready to be marked with paint so they can be removed.

When those young adults were surveyed about who they turned to for help in reaching their goals or fulfilling their basic needs, an alarming number replied: “No one.” Researchers from the University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food and Environment (UKag) are helping this underserved population with the help of a five-year, $660,000 Children, Youth, and Families at Risk (CYFAR) Sustainable Community Projects grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). UKAg has partnered with Kentucky State University (KSU) Extension and two YMCA centers in the Louisville area to carry out the project. This partnership began when Louisville YMCA’s Safe Place Services contacted the Jefferson County Extension office, interested in their evidence-based life skills programming. “We have always wanted to work with the homeless, but in order to work with them you need infrastructure that Cooperative Extension doesn’t have,” said Janet Kurzynske, UK Extension professor in dietetics and human nutrition and the project’s lead investigator. “When you are working with homeless youth, you have to provide shelter. That’s what the YMCA has. So it made for a really good collaboration.” The primary goal of this program is to teach important life skills such as workforce preparation, communication, and healthy living. One way this program will achieve that goal is through a community garden. “The garden is on YMCA Shelter House property and will be used to supply fresh food to the shelter and give them an opportunity to build hands-on skills,” said Kurzynske. Researchers will collect throughout the program to determine its effectiveness, providing records for CYFAR’s Common Measures for workforce preparation, a national program measuring young people’s ability to effectively solve problems and make decisions. NIFA’s CYFAR program helps improve the quality and quantity of comprehensive community-based programs for at-risk children, youth, and families supported by the Cooperative Extension System. CYFAR marshals resources of the Land-Grant University and Cooperative Extension Systems to develop and deliver educational programs that equip limited resource families and youth who are at-risk for not meeting basic human needs with the skills they need to lead positive, productive, contributing lives. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Boston Beats the Asian Longhorned Beetle  One of the things I consider a highlight of my career and that I will always remember is our successful response to the July detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) in Boston, Massachusetts.  As I attended the May 12 ceremony commemorating the eradication of the ALB infestation in Boston and listened to the speakers share their thoughts about what it took to get us there, I had a deep sense of appreciation for the partnership among the state and federal cooperators who worked together to bring us to that day.  It was swift action and continued diligence that protected Boston’s trees from further destruction. APHIS and its cooperators were able to accomplish the goal of eradicating ALB in Boston in less than 4 years.  Thanks also go to a community member who reported the infestation early.  That early detection and report resulted in the loss of only 6 infested trees. But as I celebrate our first victory over the invasive pest in Massachusetts, I am compelled to ask you to remain vigilant in inspecting your trees regularly for signs of the beetle and report any suspicious damage to your State Plant Health Director.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Worcester, MA in  Animals  Plants  Jun 01,  APHIS recognizes Ingram Carner with a certificate of appreciation for being the first person in the United States to spot the Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB). ALB experts Joseph Gittleman of APHIS' Plant Protection and Quarrantine program and Joan Mahoney of the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets recognized Carner in April. Carner first noticed small holes in the Norway maples on his property in Brooklyn, N.Y., in . The holes were slightly smaller than a dime, but larger than the diameter of a pencil. The holes were identified as the exit holes where the invasive ALB emerges from the tree trunk.  At first, Carner thought the holes were the work of vandals, but later spotted the beetle on the same trees, which have a distinct appearance. He reported it to authorities, which eventually led to eradication efforts and regulation changes that are still underway today. The insect has since been found in other areas of New York City, Long Island, Staten Island, northern New Jersey,  Illinois and Massachussetts. Carner also received a certificate of appreciation, a plaque, and an autographed copy of a book about the ALB. It's notable that Carner isn't a trained naturalist, botanist or entomologist—he's a citizen with a sharp eye who knew something was amiss and performed his civic duty in reporting it.

"Reversing Pollinator Decline is Key to Feeding the Future  Without pollinators, we don’t eat—it’s simple as that—and, at the moment, large numbers of pollinators are dying.  With the world’s population projected to exceed 9 billion in just the next 30 years or so, that is not a good position for us to be in. More than 90 species of U.S. specialty crops require pollination, and various animals, including bees, butterflies, moths, bats, and birds are a critical part of the pollinator-plant ecosystem.  Despite the myriad species of pollinators available, American farmers rely on one species of honey bee, Apis mellifera, for most of the pollinator services to pollinate their crops. Wild and managed bees together add $15 billion in crop value each year.

"Training Technician, National Detector Dog Training Center in  Animals  Plants  Aug 12,  Thunder attending a course at the National Detector Dog Training Center. My name is Thunder.  Not too many months ago, I was homeless and waiting for someone to take me home from the Houston Beagle Rescue in Houston, Texas.  Then, a nice lady from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s National Detector Dog Training Center (NDDTC) in Newnan, Georgia came to visit.  From that day on, my life changed. At the NDDTC, I met my human handler and my fellow classmates.  What a diverse group!  You see, detector dogs come from places all over the country, including humane societies, beagle rescue groups and private owners.  Before we’re adopted, we go through extensive temperament tests and are evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.  And when we retire from service, or if we don’t meet the training requirements, APHIS ensures that we’re adopted and placed in good homes. My classmates and I trained hard for four whole months and learned how to prevent pests and diseases from coming in on smuggled agricultural products.  I learned the scent of agricultural contraband and how to find it in bags, boxes and parcels.  Beagles and beagle mixes are really good at sniffing out food and agricultural items in luggage and on passengers.  Labs and lab mixes trained hard to patrol international borders, cargo warehouses and postal facilities for smuggled contraband.  Even Jack Russell terriers have a job—they learned to detect invasive brown tree snakes in Guam. Eek! Thunder attending a course at the National Detector Dog Training Center. My job is extra special—I sniff out the invasive Asian Longhorned Beetle, an invasive insect that’s killing trees in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Ohio.  I didn’t know much about the ALB until I started this job, but I did know that my handler kept giving me treats just for sniffing out beetle “frass”, or the sawdust the beetle leaves behind as it chews.  If there is something I am really good at it is sniffing and eating treats.  After all, I am a beagle! My handler says I am part of an important team dedicated to protecting neighborhood trees and this country’s valuable forest resources. Wow!  That’s a lot for a little beagle from Texas to take in, but I am proud to protect America from these harmful pests and diseases. You play a vital role in preventing the establishment and spread of invasive pests and diseases, too.  To learn more about what you can do to help, check out the “Attack of the Invasive Species” factsheet at or visit our Hungry Pests wesbite.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Kentucky in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 16,  The University of Kentucky is using a Conservation Innovation Grant to improve the efficiency of seasonal high tunnels. NRCS and UK staff view a water line with a high tunnel in the background. NRCS photo. Seasonal high tunnels have emerged in the past few years as an important tool for farmers wanting to extend their growing seasons. Right now, thanks to a Conservation Innovation Grant from USDA, a University of Kentucky professor is studying them – and how they can be made more efficient. Krista Jacobsen, an assistant professor of horticulture, is studying the soil inside of high tunnels and the possibilities of catching rainwater to irrigate crops inside of them. High tunnels are plastic-covered structures that enable farmers to have crops ready earlier or later in the season. In high tunnels, plants are grown directly in the ground, and the sun’s heat regulates the temperature inside. Since , USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service has provided assistance to help producers construct more than 9,000 high tunnels on farms around the country. In the past two years, more than 400 have been installed in Kentucky. Many farmers use drip irrigation to water crops in high tunnels. The water typically comes from natural sources, such as ponds or springs, or from city water. But city water can often cost more and the chemicals sometimes added to it aren’t good for plants because they can cause a buildup of salts, said John Graham, a soil health specialist. Jacobsen is looking at a device that will catch rainwater and then make it available to irrigate crops. This puts natural water to use, simulating rainfall on traditional field crops. Using rainwater also conserves water by not using underground sources.” “A main focus of this project is decreasing the ‘water footprint’ of high tunnel production for a variety of locations in Kentucky,” she said. “In areas with access to city water, this means reducing the use of drinking-quality water for irrigation purposes.” And in rural areas, it offers a low-cost and simple solution for farmers, she said. “Our project focuses on developing rainwater capture systems that are scale-appropriate to the smaller high tunnels popping up throughout Appalachia, and training farmers on efficient irrigation practices using relatively low-cost soil water monitoring equipment,” Jacobsen said. The first of the rainwater catchment devices developed and constructed by the university will be installed and demonstrated for this fall and winter crop. These irrigation systems rely on low-pressure irrigation systems powered by gravity, something the university is studying at two demonstration sites, a partnership with Grow Appalachia in London, Kentucky, and the University of Kentucky Robinson Center for Appalachian Resources for Sustainability in Jackson, Kentucky. The Conservation Innovation Grant program helps groups, like the University of Kentucky, demonstrate innovative approaches to improve soil quality, air quality, and water quality, conserve energy, and enhance wildlife habitat in balance with productive agricultural systems. Just yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced USDA is investing $15.7 million through grants to 47 entities.

"APHIS Administrator in  Animals  Plants  Aug 01,  Tiny to the naked eye, the adult Asian citrus psyllid is no bigger than a common gnat and feeds with the posterior of its body raised. This invasive insect causes serious damage to citrus plants and citrus plant relatives through its feeding activities (photos are by R. Anson Eaglin, APHIS). USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has declared August as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month.  Invasive plant pests and diseases are not just a concern of scientists, farmers or horticulturalists; they concern us all.  Invasive pests and diseases of plants—such as Asian citrus pysllid, European grapevine moth, Mediterranean fruit fly, and sudden oak death—can transform communities, harm our economy, and impact human health. APHIS works to stop invasive pests and diseases of plants from arriving on our shores, and to address those that gained a foothold in our communities or that threaten agricultural resources, like citrus.  Through safeguarding activities overseas, on the border and across the country, APHIS helps to ensure a diverse natural ecosystem and an abundant and healthy food supply for all Americans. There have been successes.  Invasive pests now eradicated include the Asian longhorned beetle in Chicago and parts of New Jersey.  Mediterranean fruit fly and Asian Gypsy moth infestations in several states are now eradicated.  But the fight to regulate, contain or eradicate invasive pests continues.  In this effort APHIS works very closely with partners at the federal, state, county and local levels, and at universities, and nongovernmental organizations. But, the most important partner in protecting agricultural and forested resources from invasive pests and diseases are those most familiar with their communities—individuals like you.  By using available tools, you can join heroes like the Massachusetts homeowner who spied shiny black beetles spotted with white in her maples and searched the Internet for information out of concern for children handling the insects.  That Internet search and subsequent report to agricultural officials led to the detection of a significant Asian longhorned beetle infestation. Asian longhorned beetle infestations have been eradicated in Chicago, Illinois and northern New Jersey. This large, showy beetle appears similar to the white spotted sawyer, a native insect, but is a voracious consumer of many tree species, such as maples (photos are by R. Anson Eaglin, APHIS). This month, APHIS will post a series of blog entries here and also share invasive plant pest and disease information through our twitter feed.  Please follow us.  You can also use links and resources on our website to get involved.  Armed with knowledge, you can help.  It is a fight for our communities, our public lands, and for our agricultural resources.

"USDA and Peace Corps Team Up in Screwworm Eradication Efforts in Panama  Over the past few months, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), as part of the U.S. Panama Commission for Eradication of Screwworm, has started to partner with Peace Corps Volunteers in Panama to enhance APHIS’ surveillance activities. Volunteers will be working in rural Panama and meeting with local communities to raise awareness about as well as report suspected cases of New World screwworm, one of the most costly and economically significant pests of livestock in South America. The New World screwworm is a parasite of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Female screwworms are attracted to and lay their eggs in exposed flesh wounds.  After eggs hatch, larvae burrow and feed on flesh, causing severe tissue damage and may even be lethal to the host. The screwworm was eradicated from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao and, finally, all of Central America in using the Sterile Insect Technique in which sterile male flies are released in massive numbers to mate with wild female populations. The mated female flies then lay non-viable eggs, leading to a decrease and subsequent eradication of screwworm populations. To prevent the screwworm from spreading north of South America, The Commission is maintaining a barrier at the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia, by utilizing both preventive release of sterile flies and field surveillance.

"Making a Promise in Puerto Rico  When Roosevelt Roads Naval Base ceased operations in , the surrounding region suffered a significant population and financial loss. The land transfer process from the Navy to the local government created the Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA), entity with the responsibility of leading the rebuilding process and revitalization of the former base and the adjacent communities of Ceiba, Fajardo and Naguabo. The collaboration between the LRA and the communities seeks to improve public infrastructure and renovate economic activity in the area, as well as improve access to health care, improve educational opportunities, reduce crime, and spur job creation. The area served by the Roosevelt Roads LRA in eastern Puerto Rico was recently designated a Promise Zone by President Obama.

"-Cooperative Service Administrator, Sam Rikkers in  Rural  Jan 12,  Kentucky Highlands Promise Zone invests in local foods. As a law student, I spent a summer working and living with the Sokoagon Band of the Chippewa, a Native American tribe located in rural Northern Wisconsin.  Tribal leaders and members extended to me their kindness, friendship, passion and laughter.  They are some of our country’s finest. But, make no mistake, the Sokoagon face challenges shared by many persistently poor rural communities across our country. That summer, I saw with new eyes the importance of dependable and consistent employment, housing, health care systems and education.  That summer I also saw that for many rural Americans these things, taken for granted by many, are luxuries. These agents of economic development are not only critical to a person’s economic success, they are necessary to the success and fate of all people and thriving communities. While our nation is in the heart of a strong economic recovery, too many of our rural communities continue to struggle to build a resilient middle-class. For decades, rural Americans have worked harder and harder, yet found it increasingly more difficult to get ahead in our modern economy.  As a means to uphold his commitment to rural America, the Promise Zone Initiative is part of President Obama’s plan to create a better bargain for the middle-class. This Initiative is driven by three core principles: 1) engage and partner with communities, 2) build community capacity for planning and implementation, and 3) learn from what worked and what didn’t. As we round out the holiday season and gear up for a new year, let’s first start by looking back on the past year and highlight our Promise Zones’ exceptional work. At the heart of the Promise Zone initiative are communities and middle- and low-income families. Many are on the cusp of success, but need the right tools to create jobs, expand educational opportunities, increase economic activity, leverage private investment, and reduce violent crime. Choctaw Youth visit with President Obama. Last year, President Obama emphasized that communities make the greatest progress when we “bring together local government and nonprofits and businesses and teachers and parents around a shared goal,” and when, “[All hold] themselves accountable by delivering measurable results.” Our first four rural and tribal Promise Zones, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Kentucky Highlands, South Carolina Low Country, and Pine Ridge Reservation of the Oglala Sioux Tribe are yielding substantial results. Accessible local food is a staple in American culture. The Kentucky Highlands Promise Zone’s has seen enormous strides in developing a strong local food economy. In early July, local partners of the Kentucky Highlands Promise Zone announced the creation of a low-interest loan fund for small farmers in the 54-county SOAR region of eastern and southern Kentucky. Investments like these mean real opportunities for small growers who want to make strategic investments in expanding their operations. Like electricity was 80 years ago, access to broadband service in rural America can make or break a community.  Broadband is no longer a luxury, but a critical piece of infrastructure. In early July , President Obama announced the ConnectHome initiative, selecting the Choctaw Nation as one of the pilot areas where the federal government and the private sector would partner to expand high-speed broadband. Today, the ConnectHome initiative is making a real difference in people’s lives, linking homes and businesses to a world beyond the small communities of the Choctaw. A street sign highlights the budding South Carolina Low Country Promise Zone partnerships. Revitalizing a stagnant rural economy is tough without critical investments attracting good-paying dependable jobs. The South Carolina Low Country Promise Zone knows this first-hand. Recently, USDA invested over $8 million in water and waste infrastructure in Hampton County, South Carolina, supporting the development of a regional industrial park. In total, the Promise Zone a whopping $312 million in capital investment and 153 jobs created since September . For communities focused on the bread and butter of economic recovery, planning is fundamental. The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation is opening a planning office to ensure investments are harnessed and deployed effectively. The Pine Ridge Promise Zone has received federal technical assistance and investments to help build basic infrastructure such as water and waste systems and vital community facilities supporting a tribal college and the Oglala Sioux Tribe’s public safety system. As we look toward our third and final round of applicants, the impact of the Promise Zone initiative on these four American communities is powerful. Our communities, federal agencies, and partners will continue to work alongside one another, providing boots-on-the-ground partnership and access to the vital resources necessary to make good on our shared promise.

Tribal elder Cecilia Fire Thunder facilitated. Recently USDA Rural Development staff in South Dakota spent two days at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, home of the Oglala Sioux, where they met with Tribal leaders, educators and other Federal partners.  They made this trip as part of a broader administration effort to change the way the federal government works with communities. This approach values residents’ knowledge of their communities’ strengths and needs; it also includes local leaders as essential partners and collaborators. Jennifer Irving, Director of Regional Equity for Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation, a local non-profit intimately involved in one-such effort at Pine Ridge said, “It is important to coordinate engagement of the Promise Zone stakeholders to ensure that Tribal Leadership’s vision and priorities are being met while optimizing Tribal commitment of time and resources.” Pine Ridge was designated a Promise Zone last April and in July a Presidential Disaster Declaration was received following severe summer storms. Since then the federal government, the Oglala Sioux Tribal government, and local organizations, such as Thunder Valley and other key partners have been working collaboratively to ensure activities, investments, and projects of the many entities across the reservation have broad-based community support and coordinated, and likely to yield results for residents. Dr. Richard Zephier provided an overview of the CEDS process and long term vision to develop a stronger economy for Pine Ridge. Visiting Rural Development staff were given an overview of the wide array of work underway including the Tribe’s work on a proposed Tribal Planning Office and a Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy (CEDS) that will lay out a long term vision for developing a stronger economy for Pine Ridge.  Other topics covered included recovery efforts underway in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recovery efforts and an overview of the work two local organizations, Mazaska and Lakota Funds, are doing to identify housing and other finance-related needs. At Oglala Lakota College we met with President Shortbull who talked about work underway to develop an Ag Expo Center that would be instrumental in making local food a path for economic development. The College has already raised a substantial amount toward the expected total project need. A representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table. This project will create educational opportunities in the community by increasing training and hands on experience for producers of all types of agricultural production on Pine Ridge. It will expand their economic opportunities by providing a place where producers can work in a commercial kitchen or work with large animals in a modern facility. This project has broad public support and holds significant potential for the Tribe and people living at Pine Ridge. While at Pine Ridge we also heard directly from Oglala Sioux youth at a roundtable with high school students at Little Wound School.  Of all of the meetings over the course of the two days, this opportunity to connect with the students at Little Wound that really hit home. The stories of hope, struggle and the students’ passion inspired us even more with the work ahead. Persistent poverty and lack of infrastructure investment have taken their toll at Pine Ridge. Now, these placed–based efforts aims to leverage investments, increase economic activity, improve educational opportunities and improve the quality of life in the area through focused work on the six goals the community has identified as instrumental to improve the economic health of the area, increase the quality of life and accelerate the work to create comprehensive community revitalization. First, accelerate job creation by building the foundation for new businesses including implementation of workforce development programs to ensure people are trained with the skills to fill new positions. Second, increase economic activity by addressing economic issues at the systemic level—like expanding increasing banking options and affordable housing for the workforce on the Reservation. Third, improve educational opportunities on the Reservation from primary school through the post-secondary level by offering Lakota immersion education, charter school options and opportunities at the Oglala Lakota College. Fourth, improve public safety Reservation by addressing substance abuse issues and strengthening the justice system. Fifth, provide affordable, low maintenance, energy efficient housing for residents of the Reservation, focusing on key issues like affordable rent, homeownership and middle income housing by developing the real estate market and increasing access to capital. Sixth, systematically develop infrastructure by providing the Tribal government with the ability to operate, maintain, and replace current infrastructure and facilitate future development. A representative from each of the round table break-out sessions provided the entire group a synopsis of the top issues that were drawn out of the round table discussion at their respective table. The Promise Zone Initiative is part of the President’s plan to partner with local communities, businesses and Tribes to create jobs, increase economic security, expand educational opportunities, increase access to quality, affordable housing and improve public safety.  To date, thirteen Promise Zones have been designated across the country; Pine Ridge is one of only two Tribal Promise Zones.  Seven more Promise Zones will be designated in and applications are currently being accepted. We know that increasingly, the community where a child grows up in impacts her odds of graduating high school, her health outcomes, and her lifetime economic opportunities. The Administration has been steadily embarking on a different approach to working with communities to ensure where a child is born never determines her destiny. The Promise Zone Initiative is one of the Administration’s community-based initiatives in action across the country.  In these places federal experts are working side by side with residents and local leaders to create customized solutions; bolstering coordination across agencies and improving how we interact with communities as a ‘one Government’ partner; and relying on valuable to help inform solutions and evaluate what’s working and what’s not. The Promise Zone designation enables USDA to work more collaboratively with other federal agencies in partnership with the Oglala Sioux and others across the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation on efforts to increase economic mobility and create opportunities across the entire region.  To view all active community-based initiatives in your community, visit www.whitehouse.gov/omb/place.

"Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Jul 03,  A family dinner of marinated chicken and grilled vegetables. Photo by Christopher Leonard.  With Independence Day just around the corner, families across the nation are making preparations to honor the day as the grill chef, king of Castle Suburbia, lord of the living room, master of the flames, marches forth. With a meaty feast to honor the day, the Fourth of July has become almost as much a celebration of grilling greatness as it is a celebration of the nation’s independence. However, all that glitters isn’t gold and an infection of Salmonellosis can quickly knock the grill king off his throne and onto another. Fittingly, the Fourth of July sits in the middle of grilling season. The amber flames roaring up between the grill grates can easily give the false impression of bringing death to all bacteria. However, don’t be misled. Preparing burgers on the grill is a quest that must be tackled safely. Taking the four oaths of food safety (clean, separate, cook and chill) will ensure a feast free from visits to the porcelain throne, or worse, a trip to the emergency room. The battle against foodborne illness begins on the way home from the store. Separating raw meat products from ready-to-eat products on the journey home is an essential step in preventing cross-contamination. Cooking hamburgers to 160 degrees will safely kill Salmonella and dangerous E. coli bacteria, but it does no good if you contaminated a salad with raw meat juice. And the specter of Salmonella isn’t constrained to poultry. No, the risk from this bug reaches to beef, pork and other meats as well as poultry. Ever hear the phrase “clean as you cook?” It’s sage advice considering cross contamination can ruin nearly any dish. Cutting boards, cabinet handles, countertops, basically anything you may touch with your dirty, meaty hands can potentially transmit pathogens. A recent FSIS-sponsored study asked 80 consumers to prepare a meal including a fruit salad and meat dish. The meat provided was inoculated with L. casei, a bacterium found in yogurt, to test average food safety preparation. Half of the group heard food safety messages and half did not. Despite this, 90 percent of the fruit salads were contaminated with the target bacteria. Kitchen towels were a major source of contamination, but the sink, refrigerator, oven and trash cabinet handles were also contaminated, just waiting to infect something else. Check back soon for more information on this study’s findings. If the grill king’s subjects use proper techniques (see FoodSafety.gov for tips), there is still the matter of cooking the meat. Despite the common advice of cooking to color or checking juices, the ONLY way of ensuring doneness is with a food thermometer. Nothing else, short of dragon fire will do. Finally, keep cool by keeping food cool. Don’t leave food out in the hot summer air without a way to chill it. Again, fightback.org is a good source for tips on what foods can stay out and for how long. Stick to these four oaths of food safety and the grill king and his guests will enjoy the feast to honor the day. Make it a safe one.

"Ensuring Healthy Meals during the Summer Helps Kids Head Back to Class Ready to Learn  Children who live in the Franklin Vista Apartments in Anthony, N.M., didn’t have to walk far to receive a healthy breakfast and lunch this summer, thanks to Gadsden ISD Food Service Director Demetrious Giovas.  He made sure children there were able to gather under the covered porch of the apartment community center for a nutritious meal.  The school district set up tables each day to ensure the kids had access to healthy food while school was out of session. For the first time, Gadsden ISD provided daily breakfasts and lunches to children at apartments through the Seamless Summer Option of the National School Lunch Program. Food was prepared at the local elementary school, where it was distributed to 14 sites including Franklin Vista Apartments, as well as churches, other community-based facilities and schools.  Throughout the summer, sites sponsored by the school district provided an average of 2,000 lunches and 1,900 breakfasts each weekday.

(Photo courtesy of Holly Krake/OJCCCC) Pop music star Beyonce recently partnered with First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative to create the Let’s Move! Flash Workout.  The Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center in Cherokee, N.C. has embraced the Let’s Move! concept, and launched a Healthy Eating and Active Lifestyles program. Oconaluftee has gotten behind this national movement by producing a student fitness video using the music and choreography of the Let’s Move! Flash Workout.   As with many songs, the name ‘Move Your Body’ says it all. The flash workout is a dance, an exercise, and a fun activity that all students can participate in. Over 20 students performed the flash workout in front of the entire campus to show how simple and easy it is.  “It was truly amazing and I really enjoyed it” said student choreographer Kayosha Roseboro. For several days leading up to the showcase, students learned the steps, the rhythm changes, and how to coordinate movement in a large group. The flash workout also allowed for many styles of dance including Dancehall, Hip Hop, Salsa, ‘old school’ Running Man, and today’s top moves like ‘the Dougie’. Beyonce’s lyrics throughout the song ‘Move Your Body,’ encourage those who may be hesitant to get active, “a little sweat never hurt nobody” and that realize that there is no wrong way to get moving. “This whole campaign is about encouraging people around the country to move their body in any way, shape, or form but just move your body” concluded Roseboro. As an education and training program focused on young adults, Forest Service Job Corps can play a critical role in helping students make healthy choices as adults. “What we’re talking about is shifting a sedentary and unhealthy body mindset to one of smart food choices and energizing activities” said campus Trainee Employee Assistance Program Coordinator, Lakeisha Gallaspy.  “If a flash workout is what it takes in then that’s what we’ll do!” The Oconaluftee Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center works closely with the Forest Service’s National Forests in North Carolina. It is accredited by the Council on Occupational Education and currently serves 104 students. The mission of the U.S. Forest Service is to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations. Recreational activities on our lands contribute $14.5 billion annually to the U.S. economy. The agency manages 193 million acres of public land, provides assistance to state and private landowners, and maintains the largest forestry research organization in the world.

"Office of Communication, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 03,  View of the Milky Way over Cathedral Rock, seen from the Cathedral Rock Trailhead on Back O' Beyond Road, Coconino National Forest, Sedona, Arizona, April 30, . (USDA Forest Service photo by Deborah Lee Soltesz) The country’s annual celebration of its independence is not complete without family gatherings, picnics, parades, and the sights and sounds of fireworks. Yet on national forests and grasslands, fireworks and other explosives are prohibited permanently. Public lands provide another option for celebrating the Fourth: Simply look up at night. Nature’s light show can provide its own “oohs and ahhs.” Stargazing, especially in areas where darkness is broken only by campfires, provides spectacular shows. Although fireworks are not allowed, national forests and grasslands are the perfect spaces to spend your holiday. They provide entertainment for everyone, from camping, to cookouts, to places to enjoy water recreation. If camping or picnicking is what you are planning, make sure you check with the local ranger district of your national forest or grassland for any bans on open flames, whether it’s a fire pit, grill or campfire. Even if there are no bans, please be cautious. The rule to ensuring your campfire is out is to drown, stir, drown and feel with the back of your hand to ensure the fire is fully out. Letting a campfire die out naturally is not safe. Hot embers could be smoldering underneath the ashes and could reignite. Remember, the ashes should be cold to the touch. You can also use a mesh dome over fire pits to help stop embers from flying in the air and landing on dry grass. These embers could spark a fire in an area further than your campsite. Other safety tips include being careful to not park on tall, dry grass. The heat from the car, or chains dragging along the ground if you are pulling something, could spark a fire. For more information, check out our Know Before You Go tips and wildfire prevention advice from Smokey Bear. We want you to enjoy your Fourth of July safely.

"USDA Rural Development, Office of External Affairs in  Rural  Equity  Jun 03,  Today, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack kicked off National Homeownership Month. Each year, as part of this nationwide celebration, USDA highlights programs that help people in rural and Tribal areas buy, build and repair affordable homes. At USDA, we believe every American should have the opportunity to own a home. Since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, Rural Development has helped over 266,000 rural individuals and families buy, build and repair homes through programs including the Single Family and Multifamily Housing Programs. USDA is ready to support the housing needs of all people living in rural and Tribal communities. Take, for instance, Norma Nix, a resident of Mineral Hills, New Mexico. When a forest fire destroyed her family home, USDA Rural Development stepped in to help. “I lost everything on Mother’s Day—my entire home, my photos, and of my children’s childhood memories,” Nix explained. Through the Rural Disaster Housing Repair Grant Program, Norma was able to apply for assistance and rebuild her new home. Stories like Norma’s highlight how USDA is helping rural and Tribal Americans and is committed to aiding families who lost their homes to disaster. USDA Rural Development’s number one program, Single Family Housing Direct Home Loans, enables qualified lower-income applicants to buy homes with no money down. Kailee Meyer, a recent graduate and resident of Jasper County, Iowa, realized her dream of homeownership through this program. “When I graduated from Central College in Pella, I wondered what I was going to do for housing,” said Meyer. “I never had to worry about it before”. Meyer researched USDA after a family friend introduced the idea to her and found the program that helped her purchase the home of her dreams. Since its inception, approximately 2.2 million families and individuals have purchased homes with USDA’s Single Family Housing Direct Loans program. President Biden announced a plan to increase affordable housing throughout the country, especially in rural areas. The plan aims to close America’s housing supply shortfall by creating and preserving hundreds of thousands of affordable housing units. It will also help renters struggling with high rental costs by focusing on building and preserving rental housing for low- and moderate-income families. For more information about homeownership, home repair, and rental assistance programs, visit the Single Family Housing program webpage or contact a Rural Development State Office to learn more about USDA homeownership programs near you.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Dec 20,  Years ago, I spent my days watching pecan roots change the color of solutions from clear to red as they reduced iron for uptake. It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children’s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics. Now, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I’m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change. As an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce. My internship introduced me to the importance of agricultural research and attracted me to a career where I could use science to inform agricultural policy.

"Regional Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Apr 23,  For the people living on Smith Island, the water matters. But it’s about more than the beautiful views of the Chesapeake Bay from the picturesque island ten miles from the mainland. The multi-generational residents depend on the surrounding Chesapeake Bay for their livelihoods. For many, crabbing, oystering, and ecotourism are what puts dollars in their bank accounts, and food on their tables. In rural communities like Smith Island, located in and along the Chesapeake Bay, aging wastewater facilities are in need of upgrades. Not only can this be an expensive problem for towns with small populations, but without the critical upgrades, the threat of combined sewer overflows from more frequent weather events and climate change could contribute to pollution of the Chesapeake Bay. So, what is being done to help these rural communities protect the environment and preserve a way of life that impacts so many? USDA Rural Development and partners are answering the call by investing in state-of-the art, modern wastewater treatment facilities in communities like Smith Island and many others located throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility Smith Island’s wastewater treatment facility consisted of two pump stations, serving the three communities that make up Smith Island: Ewell, Rhodes Point, and Tylerton. After four decades and prolonged exposure to the elements, the components of the wastewater treatment facility began to corrode, break down, and fail. This left the surrounding bay and wildlife vulnerable to combined sewer overflows. Federal, state, and local agencies collaborated on a solution: a new, modern wastewater treatment facility. Through the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program, USDA Rural Development provided the community with $83,000 in loan, and $5,000,000 in grant funds, with other partners providing the balance, to help the community afford the $22.3 million Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility. Peter Bozick, Executive Vice President of George, Miles & Buhr, LLC, the engineer and architecture firm that designed the new facility said, “The island is sinking slowly due to climate change and rising sea levels, and the former infrastructure was susceptible to flooding. In addition to replacing the treatment facility with new materials that can resist corrosion, we raised the pumping stations about five feet higher in order to be above the 100-year flood zone.” Read more about how this significant investment in improving infrastructure on Smith Island is contributing to a positive outlook for the future of Smith Island.

"Public Affairs Specialist, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Apr 15,  Today marks 110 years since the sinking of what was thought to be an unsinkable ship. Recognized every year on April 15, Titanic Remembrance Day honors the more than 1,500 people who lost their lives in the early hours of that day. Though experts still debate the main causes of the maritime catastrophe, we know some details about the voyage. For example, two copies of the first-class dinner menu from April 14 were recovered and preserved. Many restaurants in the United States recreate it in memory of the day. Below, USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service pairs some of the foods served then with current U.S. agricultural statistics: The meal started with oysters ($284.9 million in sales), cream of barley soup (1.9 million acres (, 2.1 ) of barley harvested in ), and poached salmon (the United States had 13 Atlantic salmon farms and two Pacific salmon farms in *).

There is a wealth of historical that’s inaccessible because today’s crop model software applications cannot easily interpret it. USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) is working with the University of Florida and the Agricultural Research Network (ARDN) to solve this problem. ARDN is dedicated to making high value datasets from past research and experiments compatible with crop models and other analytical tools. With support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), NAL and the University of Florida are piloting a “hackathon” approach to make this old useful. Experts gather several times a year to create standardized vocabulary and extract relevant information to use in the AgMIP Crop Experiment schema (ACE) – a widely used format for agricultural models. As part of the NIFA grant, the team will annotate four datasets using ARDN protocols. The initial datasets include research from projects at Iowa State University, University of Georgia, the University of Arizona, and the Kellogg Biological Station. These annotated datasets will be available on NAL’s Ag Commons website. NAL also supports ARDN by hosting VMapper software on the Ag Commons website. VMapper creates a file which contains the “road map” for translating the original into the ACE format. ARDN’s collaborative efforts will save crop modelers time and give them access to much more historical , accelerating research and new discoveries.

"Survey Administration Branch Chief, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Oct 26,  Last week, the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) began collecting for its first ever Hemp Acreage and Production Survey. Hemp is a commodity that can be used for numerous industrial and horticultural purposes, including fabric, food products, cosmetics, and more. Yet, there is no comprehensive, national production for it. That’s where NASS comes in. NASS conducts hundreds of surveys each year as well as the Census of Agriculture, which is done every five years. As a result, the agency maintains the most comprehensive list of agricultural operations in the United States. NASS has extensive experience in not only using the list to conduct studies of various agricultural populations but also doing so securely and confidentially. For the hemp survey, NASS did more than just use its own comprehensive list of operations. The agency also gathered information from partners at USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, Risk Management Agency, and Farm Service Agency as well as state departments of agriculture and other sources. Any records provided by these sources that were not found on the NASS list were included in the survey. To design the survey itself, NASS conducted cognitive interviews with hemp growers to determine correct terminology and understanding of questions. The result of this hard work will be survey that set the benchmark for hemp acreage and production, and provide needed to regulatory agencies, producers, state governments, processors, and other key industry entities. NASS is encouraging producers to respond online at agcounts.usda.gov.

To afford housing, he and his wife shared a house with their adult son. But when an electrical malfunction caused a fire - destroying the house - they were devastated. They lost everything. With help from their church they were able to find new housing, but the high rent coupled with the added burden of replacing their furniture and other basic necessities proved too much.

"Posted by Doug O'Brien, Acting Under Secretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Technology  Oct 22,  A Matanuska Telephone Association Lineman works to bring high-speed broadband to Chickaloon and Glacier View. Photo courtesy MTA. Today, Secretary Vilsack announced over $190 million of investment in broadband projects through USDA's Community Connect program, the Public Television Digital Transition Grant, and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program. Time and time again, we hear stories about the significant impact USDA’s investments have in the lives of hard working Americans, and we know that an investment in our rural communities is an investment in America. At the terminus of the majestic Matanuska Glacier in Southcentral Alaska sits the tiny community of Glacier View. It's better than an hour's drive northwest of Palmer, the headquarters of the Matanuska Telephone Association (MTA). With a population of fewer than 250 residents, the unincorporated community hosts a lodge, a gas station, and tourism-related businesses that provide visitors access to the massive glacier just south of  the community. Not far down the road you'll find Glacier View School, a K-12 public school that serves children in the area. Chickaloon is a half an hour down the road, and is home to tourism businesses, artisans manufacturing by hand uniquely Alaskan crafts, lodging and food, as well as the home of the Athabascan Nation Chickaloon Village. An aerial shot of the terminus of the Matanuska Glacier at Glacier View, Alaska. Photo courtesy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service With the investment of a USDA Community Connect grant, MTA is adding Glacier View, Chickaloon, and others to the growing list of communities with access to high speed broadband. Matanuska Telephone Association was founded as a cooperative over 60 years ago, and has a service area covering over 10,000 square miles – larger than the entire state of Vermont. With a USDA Community Connect investment, and local investment from MTA, students, families, manufacturers, small businesses, and Native communities will have access to upwards of 10 Mbps upload and download speeds – that allows these very rural communities to connect and compete globally. Additionally, with the Community Connect grant, the folks that live along the Glenn Highway between Chickaloon and Glacier View will also have access to a brand new Community Connect Center providing free broadband access for the next two years. The Community Connect grant creates an opportunity for USDA to partner with our cooperatives and other public and private sector entities to provide rural residents access to advancing technology, to help educate students, and to give rural crafters and manufacturers access to a global customer base. As Secretary Vilsack said in today’s announcement, “Modern telecommunications and broadband access is as essential to the businesses and residents of Rural America as electricity was in the s.” Investing in rural America adds to the economic viability of rural communities, which strengthens the nation’s economy and helps all of America to thrive.

"International Trade and Development Branch, Economic Research Service and Gopi Munisamy, Director, Market and Trade Economics Division in  Research and Science  Trade  May 09,  In terms of employment growth, sectors outside of farming have been the major beneficiaries of agricultural exports in the past dozen years. Starting around , a divergence appears between the estimated numbers of farm and nonfarm jobs, with the latter accounting for a rising share of total employment supported by agricultural exports. Did you know that the United States is the world’s second largest agricultural exporter after the European Union? Agricultural trade supports American jobs and spurs non-farm economic activity. In , U.S. agricultural exports over one million full-time civilian jobs, including 764,000 jobs in the nonfarm sector. Each dollar of U.S. agricultural exports supported an additional $1.28 in farm and non-farm business activity. Moreover, U.S. agricultural trade surplus has historically helped to offset some of the trade deficit in non-agricultural sectors. Understanding agricultural trade trends, opportunities and challenges help inform policy decisions on trade. That is why the Economic Research Service (ERS) conducts research and analysis on the economic and policy factors underlying U.S. and global agricultural trade. Some ERS are broad in scope, focusing on factors that affect the international competitiveness of the U.S. food and agriculture sectors. The Global Landscape of Agricultural Trade, - explores growth and change in global agricultural trade and ways in which key policies have affected global trade patterns. During the last two decades, global agricultural trade volume has risen over 3.5 percent per year, and five countries—Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, and China—account for much of that increase in trade due to rising incomes and productivity growth. Other ERS research focuses on the export potential of key emerging markets and agricultural commodities of interest to U.S. producers. For example, India is the world’s largest producer and consumer of milk and has the world’s largest dairy herd. A recent ERS report, India’s Dairy Sector: Structure, Performance, and Prospects, finds that future production prospects depend heavily on productivity gains, primarily through improved breeding and feeding practices, and demand for feeds and improved genetics may offer opportunities for increased trade. Another recent ERS report, China’s Foreign Agriculture Investments, explores alternative motivations of China’s overseas investments in agriculture and their implications for U.S. agricultural exports to China. In addition, ERS works with USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) to provide forecasts for agricultural trade in the United States. These forecasts of current and next year U.S. exports and imports cover major agricultural commodities. ERS’s Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States (FATUS) provide monthly estimates of U.S. agricultural imports and exports—both value and volume—by country and commodity. Using U.S. farm-cash-receipts , ERS also estimates annual U.S. agricultural export values by State and commodity. To learn more about agricultural trade, visit the International Markets & U.S. Trade section of the ERS website and view a presentation on The Global Landscape of Agricultural Trade. Between and , world agricultural trade more than tripled in nominal terms (not adjusted for inflation) and nearly doubled in real terms (adjusted for inflation). Key factors driving this expansion include a more than 25-percent increase in the world’s population and about a 75-percent increase in the real size of the world’s economy. Other factors have also stimulated agricultural trade, including falling trade barriers and technological advances in agricultural production, transportation, information, and communications.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  Trade  Aug 05,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaks at the National Export Initiative (NEI) “New Markets, New Jobs” tour in Milwaukee, Wis. on Aug. 3, . The focus of the tour is to help small- and medium-sized businesses gain access to the resources they need to export their products internationally.  Earlier this year, the U.S. government kicked off the nationwide National Export Initiative “New Markets, New Jobs” tour designed to help connect small businesses with the resources they need to sell their products globally. The most recent stop on the tour took place in Milwaukee on August 3. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack hosted the event, which was collaboration between USDA, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), the U.S, Department of Commerce (DOC), the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Export-Import Bank (EXIM). Vilsack was in Wisconsin to focus on the state’s success story, as farm exports grew 36 percent over figures, delivering a record $2.4 billion in sales. Only Texas and Tennessee farm exports grew at a better rate. Wisconsin’s agriculture industry supports nearly 350,000 jobs in the state, or 1 in 10 jobs overall. In Milwaukee and other cities on the “New Markets, New Jobs” tour, small businesses learn about a variety of export assistance programs available to them. One such program is FAS’s Market Access Program (MAP). Through MAP, FAS helps agribusinesses with promotional efforts, technical assistance, market research and more. In alone, more than 625 new small businesses joined the thousands of companies already benefiting from MAP. Last year, WildRoots, a snack food company that is headquartered in Oklahoma and has productions facilities in Illinois and Nebraska, exported nearly $6.5 million worth of their healthy treats to Canada. While $6.5 million in exports may be a small feat for a major American food corporation, for a small agribusiness like WildRoots – who as of hadn’t begun exporting their products – achieving such a sale and gaining international customers is invaluable to the future of their business. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) like WildRoots are vital to achieving President Obama’s NEI goal of doubling all U.S. exports by the end of . As part of this initiative, the President is committed to helping U.S. farmers and small businesses expand their access to international markets. USDA and the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), which has been the department’s lead agency for accessing overseas markets for more than 50 years, have taken the President’s NEI challenge to heart. WildRoots used MAP for support with their marketing efforts in Canada. According to one of the company’s founders, without MAP “we simply would never have been able to compete with Canadian producers. It has moved our business to a new level.” MAP funding can also be used to help SMEs offset the cost of participating in USDA-endorsed international trade shows, which is another significant way FAS has helped SMEs boost international sales. In alone, USDA supported U.S. pavilions at 27 international food shows in 19 countries. Nearly 1,000 exhibitors – mostly SMEs – reported $179 million in on-site sales and more than $1 billion in 12-month sales, all resulting from their participation in these shows. Ultimately, by helping increase the agricultural exports among American SMEs, FAS is helping the United States stay on the road to economic recovery.  Even in this trying time in American economic history, agricultural exports continue to thrive. By the end of fiscal year , the United States is forecast to reach a record-breaking $137 billion in agricultural export sales. In calendar year , the first full year under NEI, U.S. agricultural exports reached $116 billion – an 18 percent increase over the previous year. For $1 billion in agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs and generates $1.31 billion in economic activity.  This means that increased exports for our nation’s agricultural small businesses is good for news for all Americans. “Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaks at the National Export Initiative (NEI) “New Markets, New Jobs” tour in Milwaukee, Wis. on Aug. 3, .

"Posted by acampbell in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Research and Science  Apr 08,   During the third day of his visit to Japan, Agriculture Secretary Vilsack had another packed day – starting with a successful bilateral meeting with his Japanese counterpart, and concluding with a series of events commemorating the 50th anniversary of a ‘hog lift’ in which Iowa farmers sent 36 hogs to Yamanashi, Japan. Prior to traveling to Yamanashi, Secretary Vilsack met with the Minister of Agriculture Hirotaka Akamatsu to discuss a wide range of agriculture topics of interest to both the United States and Japan. During their meeting, they discussed science-based solutions to U.S. beef and beef products and global food security. Additionally, Vilsack reiterated the United States’ commitment to achieving an ambitious and balanced conclusion to the Doha Round and his belief that a Doha success can be achieved if all major economies—including Japan—are willing to come to the negotiating table. Vilsack said, “This [beef] issue remains a high priority for the United States and the U.S. objective remains a framework that is consistent with science and international standards. Minister Akamatsu and I concluded our meeting by confirming that the U.S. - Japan bilateral relationship in agriculture is a strong and positive one and vowed to continue in this direction.” On the heels of his meeting with Minister Akamatsu, Secretary Vilsack boarded a train traditionally used by the Emperor for a scenic two hour ride to Kofu in the Yamanashi Prefecture for the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the now-famous “hog lift” – when generous Iowa farmers sent a group of 36 hogs to Yamanashi after Japan’s hogs were nearly wiped out by a major typhoon.  Three years after the hogs’ arrival, the original hogs had multiplied to more than 500. Vilsack had previously traveled to Japan to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the event. Upon arrival in Kofu, the Secretary, his wife, and the rest of the U.S. delegation were greeted by local elementary school children singing and playing traditional Japanese taiko drums – an event that included Yamanashi Governor Shomei Yokouchi and other Prefecture officials. Secretary Vilsack then paid a visit to the Yamanashi Prefectural Museum of Art where he participated in a tree-planting ceremony of an oak tree—Iowa’s official state tree—on the grounds of the museum to mark the 50th anniversary.  In his dedication, Secretary Vilsack stressed the importance of the diplomatic bond that had been formed between the United States and Japan as a result of this event, noting that just as the tree planted today will continue to grow stronger roots and larger branches, so too would the relationship between Japan and the U.S. grow more solid over the next 50 years of friendship and cooperation. Later that evening, Vilsack offered congratulatory remarks at the 50th anniversary ceremony where he celebrated the sister-state relationship that has been formed between Iowa and Yamanashi and how this reminds us of the benefits of cooperation and trade.  After the traditional breaking of the sake barrel to begin the festivities, Iron Chef Yukio Hattori presented an award to the winners of contest to come up with the best recipe using products grown in Iowa and Yamanashi. Secretary Vilsack (second from the left) joined (l-r) U.S. Ambassador Roos, Iowa Governor Bill Northey, Yamanashi Governor Shomei Yokouchi, and the Speaker of the Yamanashi Diet to plant an oak tree—Iowa’s official state tree—on the grounds of the Yamanashi Prefectural Museum of Art to recognize the longstanding friendship between the two states and countries.

"WS District Supervisor, Rhinelander, WI in  Animals  Plants  Nov 22,  Seeding a lake with wild rice (photo provided by the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission) When summertime begins to transition to autumn in northern Wisconsin, towards the end of August and early September, Native Americans wait with anticipation for the Wild Rice Moon, the sign it is harvest time for the grain of such cultural importance to local tribes. The generations-old tradition of the wild rice harvest represents a significant cultural event in the lives of Wisconsin’s Ojibwe, Potawatomi and Menominee tribes.  At one time wild rice served as one of the most important Native foods for these northern tribes. Families would gather in camps at rice lakes to harvest and process the grain, as well as to rekindle social relationships. Today, wild rice is still collected by traditional methods. Canoes are poled through the rice bed as a second person uses cedar sticks to pull the stalks into the boat and knock the rice off. Unfortunately, the distribution of wild rice throughout northern Wisconsin has greatly diminished from its historic range, lessening the opportunities for successful harvest.  Reasons for the decline include the negative impacts of pollution, recreational boating, and the unintentional introduction of invasive plant species.  Perhaps the most significant reason for the diminished harvest is the fluctuations of water depth. Wild rice grows in shallow water under some very specific requirements. Even subtle changes to water depth during the critical early growing period can destroy a rice bed for a season.  Continued water depth problems eventually eliminate wild rice from a lake altogether.   Beaver dams blocking the outlets of rice lakes commonly contribute to fluctuating water depth. Removal of beaver dams often serve as a critical component of wild rice restoration. U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Wildlife Services (WS) in Wisconsin provides expertise in beaver damage management for wild rice recovery and maintenance, through a partnership with the Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission (GLIFWC), individual tribes, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR).  WS monitors 23 wild rice lakes spread across northern Wisconsin for the presence of beaver dams.  On-the-ground surveys of each lake are conducted in late winter or early spring, prior to the wild rice growing season.  Any beaver dams discovered at lake outlets are removed, thereby preventing unnecessary fluctuations of water depth and allowing the wild rice to grow naturally. Lakes are monitored throughout the growing season for any increase in beaver activity.  Similar projects are undertaken by WS in Minnesota for the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe and the Chippewa National Forest. WS’ efforts have contributed to the resurgence of wild rice beds on many lakes, helping to ensure successful wild rice harvests for the future.

"Minnesota USDA Public Information Officer in  USDA Results  Rural  May 23,   Walking through AGCO’s campus in Jackson, Minn., almost feels like walking through a small city. There are large buildings, busy people heading in different directions, vehicles humming up and down roads and the constant buzz of activity and production. If AGCO was its own city, it’d be growing. Officials from USDA Rural Development and Federated Rural Electric Cooperative recently visited AGCO to highlight how a Rural Economic Development Loan is partially financing an expansion project that will increase production and create about 200 jobs. The no-interest, 10-year loan is going toward a new 75,000 square-foot addition that will add a state-of-the-art visitor’s center and additional production space. The expansion is helping AGCO roll out production of the Massey Ferguson series and the Challenger MT600 series of high horsepower wheeled tractors. “We’re a part of the community here in Jackson and we’re proud to be expanding and adding more jobs in the region,” said Eric Fisher, AGCO’s Director of Operations. AGCO’s workforce is expected to grow from 850 to almost 1,100. The company is currently producing about 50 tractors per month of the new series.  Combined with current tractor production volumes the company will product over 2,500 tractors in Jackson this year. USDA Rural Development makes loans to local utility cooperatives which are passed through and re-loaned to area businesses for expansion and job creation projects. Federated Rural Electric and Rural Development have a strong partnership and have teamed to assist several local businesses in the region.

"Posted by Secretary of State John Kerry, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Dr. Rajiv ""Raj"" Shah, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Sep 24,   From record droughts in Kansas to deadly wildfires in California, the United States is feeling the effects of climate change. These same conditions have a dire impact across the developing world, especially for poor, rural smallholder farmers whose very lives are threatened every time the rains arrive late, the floods rush in, or the temperature soars. By , the world’s population is expected to reach nine billion people. Feeding them will require at least a 60 percent increase in agricultural production. There is no greater challenge to meeting this need than climate change. It poses a range of unprecedented threats to the livelihoods of the world’s most vulnerable people and to the very planet that sustains us. In order to ensure that hundreds of millions of people are not born into a debilitating cycle of under-nutrition and hunger, we must address the urgent threat that climate change poses. That’s why today we’re announcing the launch of the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. The idea was born eight months ago, when an international delegation of leaders—including many from the USDA, the State Department, and USAID—met in South Africa for the Global Conference on Climate Change, Food Security, and Agriculture. There, we charted a more sustainable path to food security—one that preserves the environment while driving broad-based economic growth. The Alliance's solutions will encompass every type of climate and agricultural system, including better crop, livestock, and aquaculture varieties that can tolerate extreme heat, drought, and floods. We are also testing and deploying innovative tools for farmers, like weather-indexed crop and livestock insurance to help communities build resilience to severe weather. The Alliance will advance a more inclusive, innovative, and evidence-based approach to food security. It will provide platforms for partners to collaborate on agricultural practices, make key investments, develop policies that empower producers to mitigate the impact of climate change and, through sustainable agriculture practices, contribute to a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. It will also provide farmers—particularly women—with greater economic opportunities. Joining the Alliance represents an ambitious step in the United States’ efforts to integrate climate change policies into every area of our work. The Alliance will work in concert with the U.S. Global Climate Change Initiative, drawing on its expertise and experience grappling with climate change challenges in more than 50 developing countries around the world. This climate-specific knowledge and practice being pioneered today will be critical to protect lives and livelihoods, and promote low-carbon growth and development around the world. As one of his Administration's first foreign policy acts, President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton launched Feed the Future, the U.S. Government’s global hunger and food security initiative. Led by USAID—in partnership with USDA, the State Department, and eight other federal agencies—Feed the Future empowers vulnerable communities to move from dependency to self-sufficiency. In the last year alone, Feed the Future has improved the nutrition for 12.5 million children across 19 countries. At the same time, it has helped 7 million farmers grow their yields, raise their income, and begin the journey out of the devastating cycle of extreme poverty. In , President Obama rallied a group of global leaders at the G8 Summit at Camp David to launch the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, aimed to increase public-private partnerships and increase investment in agriculture. Today, we’ve leveraged $10 billion in investment from more than 200 companies—the majority from local African firms, including farmer-owned businesses. Here in the United States, we’ve taken steps to address climate change and its impact on agriculture, setting up seven climate hubs and three sub-hubs; launching the Soil Health Initiative (healthier soil captures more carbon and helps farmers succeed), engaging more farmers than any time in American history in land and water conservation efforts, and we’re contributing to the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gasses. Our experiences at home can provide lessons that are valuable for farmers around the world. We don’t have time to wait. From India to the United States, climate change poses drastic risks to every facet of our lives. Ground water supplies are vanishing faster than they can be replenished. Typhoons, wildfires, and floods are showing signs of becoming more frequent and more deadly. And with each day, families are pushed to the brink of survival—threatening our own prosperity and security in an increasingly connected world. Addressing climate change will not be an easy fix, and it won’t be simple. Long term global food security depends on us acting together now.  That’s why the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture is so critical. By joining together, we can design new technologies and create new alliances to effectively protect and manage the environment that supports us—and the thriving ecosystems that will sustain our world for generations to come.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Mar 12,  Members of the Hinds County Earth Team group gathered at Van Winkle Elementary School to give an environmental education program. Trees are important natural resources—this is the lesson that a dedicated group of volunteers shared last week with Mississippi youngsters. Seventeen members of the Earth Team, the volunteer work force of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), read Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax to students at Van Winkle Elementary School in Jackson, Miss. last Friday. The children’s book promotes the importance of the conservation of natural resources, and it was a good way to connect the Hinds County Earth Team group with youngsters in their community. The book is about a character named the Once-ler, who is profitting from the harvest of Truffula trees. The Lorax pleads with the Once-ler to conserve the trees, warning that once all are removed, the environment will be in peril. This book, first published in , is a favorite of environmental educators. This Earth Team effort was coordinated with the National Education Association’s “Read Across America Day,” promoting the reading of The Lorax in classrooms across the U.S. The group read the same book last year. Volunteers wore The Cat in the Hat-style hats and left each of the 24 classrooms with a copy of the book and gave each student a bookmark. Volunteer Nancy Lau gave the school a DVD of the classic cartoon The Lorax. This volunteer effort also coincided with the March 2 debut of the movie The Lorax, based on the book, and Dr. Seuss’ birthday. Wyvette Robinson, district clerk of the Hinds County Soil and Water Conservation District, reads The Lorax to students in Jackson, Miss. Earth Team volunteers in Hinds County received state and regional accolades last year for their dedication to environmental education for youngsters. “We hope that one day, when it’s their turn to make policy and steer our nation, [these children] will be aware of our Nation’s unique—but sensitive—ecosystems,” said Porter, district administrator for the Hinds County Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD). Mississippi’s Arbor Day is held in February, and Earth Day is in April, making trees a popular subject this time of the year. The SWCD partners with the county’s NRCS employees and Earth Team to hold a tree giveaway in early February. This year, district employees visited 24 schools, giving trees to nearly 2,000 students to take home and plant. This event was followed by two weeks of educational programs in schools on the importance of trees and how to plant them. It originally started as “Tree Planting Week,” but because of its popularity, Porter and the SWCD extended it to two weeks. Find out how to become an Earth Team volunteer in your community.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 17,  What is the Lorax? And why do we care? And why had the U.S. Forest Service taken us  from the far reaches of the forests to the carpets of Hollywood? Ask the Chief. He will be there. He knows. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell will travel to California for the premier of the animated movie Dr. Seuss’ The Lorax, which includes the agency’s first Honorary Forest Ranger Betty White.  In the movie, a 12-year-old boy (Zac Efron) tries to win a young girl’s heart (Taylor Swift) by going in search of the Lorax, a grumpy yet charming character who fights to protect the world played by Danny DeVito. Betty White plays the role of the grandmother. The movie is adapted from the book of the same name, written in by Theodor Seuss Geisel, known by millions simply as Dr. Seuss. The book is narrated by the Once-ler, a faceless character who tells a young boy the story of the lost Truffula trees, which are nowhere to be found. But as he tells his story, the Once-ler says to the boy: Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot nothing is going to get better It’s not.* The Lorax then tosses the last Truffula tree seed, urging the boy to set out and plant the seed and help bring back a forest of Truffula trees as well as the Barb-ba-loots, Swoomee-Swans and Humming-Fish that relied on a healthy forest to survive. “Given the many threats to America’s private and public forests due to a changing climate, pests and pathogens, and land conversion, this children’s story can spur conversations about what has to happen today to restore the health and productivity of America’s forests,” Tidwell said. “This is an opportunity to start a dialogue about the inherent value of forests and the importance of sustainable management.” The nation’s 193 million acres of forest and grasslands provide a wealth of public benefits: clean air and water, wildlife habitat, recreation and the wood and paper products Americans use every day. “Forests matter to everyone, and we must use and care for them responsibly and sustainably,” Tidwell said. “The Forest Service, our state partners, family forest owners and the many partner organizations we work with are helping to protect more than 751 million acres of forest land in America. Ensuring that trees are part of America’s landscape is a goal we all share with The Lorax.” The Lorax also is an integral part of a public service campaign with the Forest Service and the Ad Council. The two agencies have worked together since on a public service campaign designed to inspire children and their families to unplug and reconnect with nature. The Ad Council helped the Forest Service join forces with Universal Pictures, which created pro bono a series of new English and Spanish television, radio and outdoor public service advertisements that feature characters from the movie, which will open nationwide March 2, Dr. Seuss’ 108th birthday. The PSAs encourage viewers to go Discover the Forest, an online site that helps children learn about how to discover the wonders of forests around them. *Excerpt from The Lorax by Dr. Seuss, Random House, .

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Mar 05,   Imagine being a kid and having a senior government official come to your school to share the joy of reading and storytelling. Then imagine the excitement when an actual Dr. Seuss character enters the room! Arthur “Butch” Blazer and the Lorax. That’s what happened when Arthur “Butch” Blazer, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, recently spoke to more than 300 students at James K. Polk Elementary School in Alexandria, Va. about the importance of trees and forests. “Why are trees important?” the former State Forester of New Mexico asked the students. “Do you know where you get your drinking water every day? Much of that water comes from the forest”. “It’s so important that we take care of our forests. Remember it’s important that we keep our forests healthy so we have good water to drink. If our forests go away, where will we find our water?” Blazer proceeded to share with the curious young faces the story about The Lorax, which revolves on the Dr. Seuss character’s quest to reinvigorate a forest filled with trees and their reliant ecosystems. Standing between the students and a drop-down screen that displayed accompanying images, Blazer, who was donning his cowboy hat, began reading The Lorax. The lights were dimmed and the school’s multipurpose room was quiet with the occasional bursts of giggles by students, whose grade ranges included kindergarten, fourth and fifth grades. The kindergarteners proudly wore paper hats made to mimic Dr. Seuss’ signature Cat in the Hat. After Blazer’s storytelling came to an end, the lights came on and the students’ applause grew thunderous when their school principal surprised them with another guest -- The Lorax himself, who entered the room to greet the excited students! This event coincides with the release of Universal Pictures’ film, The Lorax. Blazer’s reading of the story also served as a component of the National Education Association’s Read Across America Day, an annual event sponsored by the association to promote literacy among children in the United States. The character, The Lorax, has additionally been part of a major public service campaign, jointly led by the Forest Service and the Ad Council since , that encourages kids to Discover the Forest. “I hope that the students learn to share our love for the environment and our love for trees,” said Heidi McAllister, assistant director of the Forest Service’s Conservation Education program in Washington, D.C., who attended the school’s special event. “I hope that they establish a relationship with the environment that will grow over time and help sustain them throughout their lives.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Butch Blazer  Forestry  The Lorax  U.S. Forest Service","What is the main takeaway from Arthur ""Butch"" Blazer's storytelling session with students, as part of the National Education Association's Read Across America Day and the US Forest Service's public service campaign?","The main takeaway from Arthur ""Butch"" Blazer's storytelling session was to educate students about the importance of trees and forests in providing clean water, and to promote a love for the environment that will grow over time."
"Davey Tree Expert Co. in  Forestry  Feb 16,   Like in many communities, tree care in Casper, Wyo. was largely reactive and just one of many duties performed by the Public Services Department staff. Year after year of seeing trees removed without a plan for replacement worried the city staff members who performed tree work. No one, however, had any basis for articulating an argument that Casper’s prized legacy—their tree canopy—was poised for imminent decline. The last large scale tree planting initiative in Casper was at the end of World War II and their urban forest, full of Siberian elms, was not aging gracefully. For a few staff members, finding a way to make a compelling argument to care for community trees that was cost effective, accessible and credible became their personal charge. “After considering our options, we felt that i-Tree would not only give us a comprehensive picture of our urban forest, but also tell us what it was doing for the community,” recalls Jim Gerhart, a member of the staff. “We needed to make a case for funding an urban forestry program and a person to run that program…we wanted to have information that would help that person hit the ground running!” Gerhart attended an i-Tree workshop in , and used his new know-how to train staff and volunteers to begin studying the value and benefits of Casper’s trees. In all, 243 tenth-acre plots located throughout the city were inventoried in this highly visible effort. The Casper Urban Forest Effects report provided a scientifically credible snapshot of Casper’s entire urban forest: street trees, park trees, and those on private lands. The results not only confirmed the vulnerability of an aging and homogenous urban forest, but also put economic values on the city’s “green” capital and the benefits it provides. Using the , city staff were able to illustrate, with certainty, that Casper’s trees were not only a valuable asset, but a fragile one too. More startling than the hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy and air quality benefits the forest produces yearly, is the investment the city found it would need to replace this component of the infrastructure if all was lost: $243 million dollars! After seeing the  i-Tree results, the city committed $450,000 to launch and administer a pilot urban forestry program over three years, and they hired the first City Forester of Casper, William Scott. “Every day we use the baseline i-Tree to determine what trees we plant and where the priorities are,” said Scott. “It really has enabled us to not only diversify the city’s tree resource, but the emerging resource that cares for the trees: the newly founded Urban Forestry Section. Our i-Tree project has allowed us to build external and internal relationships with other departments such as engineering, planning and community development that didn’t exist two years ago.” i-Tree was developed in partnership between the Forest Service, the Davey Tree Expert Company, the National Arbor Day Foundation, the Society of Municipal Arborists, the International Society of Arboriculture and Casey Trees.

"Asst. Director for Urban Forestry, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 23,   District of Columbia State Forester Monica Lear recently hosted U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell and Forest Service staff in a tour of the District for the National Association of State Foresters (NASF).  The tour highlighted diverse urban and community forestry projects and partnerships in the city. At the NASF Annual Meeting in Baltimore, Chief Tidwell spoke of the significance of the nation’s 100 million acres of urban forests where 80 percent of Americans live, work and play under their canopy. Urban trees make up an important part of the framework of green canopy in metropolitan areas connected with national, public and private lands and they are important to the health of the environment we share. The tour had eight stops focusing on: Viewing US Capitol across National Mall. (Photo courtesy of DDOT) Efforts to promote large street-tree survival Incorporation of Low Impact Design (LID) practices including trees and green roofs at the D.C. Consolidated Forensic Labs to minimize stormwater runoff Rubber sidewalk installations to reduce tree root damage Recycling and using urban wood in metro Washington, D.C. Removal of impervious surfaces  to provide new tree planting areas and increase urban tree canopy Restoration of a riparian  buffer near an armored stream Innovative approaches to increasing tree canopy health and survival Recycled urban wood use at the People’s Garden at the USDA “At the Forest Service, we recognize that our responsibilities go beyond the national forests,” said Tidwell. “We have a role to play, directly or indirectly, and that includes the nation’s 100 million acres of urban forests. Our goal is a continuous network of healthy forested landscapes, from remote wilderness areas to the urban neighborhoods where most people live.” Many of the projects highlighted on the tour were supported in part by the U.S. Forest Service’s State and Private Forestry grants in partnership with the Government of the District of Columbia or other NGO partners. Brian LeCouteur, principal environmental planner with Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, provided an overview of COG's grant project with the Wood Education Resource Center called ""The National Capital Urban Timber Recovery Project"" at lunch. This project diverts urban trees from landfills for use as lumber and woodworking in the District and Maryland. Lunch was sourced from a local farm-to-table caterer.

"New Land Ownership Add Value to Many Policy and Research Questions  Whether they farm the land themselves or rent it out to others to farm, those who own agricultural land are taking measures to keep the land in their families. This is good news for those who worry about the United States losing agricultural land to competing pressures. At USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, we just released the findings from a survey of agricultural landowners conducted earlier this year. It confirmed some things we know already and generated lots of new information that farmers, policymakers, businesses and others will use to understand more about who owns farmland, who has and will have access to farmland in the future, what kinds of conservation and production decision landowners are making, and lots more.

"The President's New Executive Order on Climate Preparedness: Another Step to Support American Agriculture  Today, President Obama established a Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience to advise the Administration on how the Federal Government can respond to the needs of communities facing the impacts of climate change. This is an important step in our shared effort to respond to climate change - and like the President's broader Climate Action Plan, it will help American agriculture mitigate and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate. America's farmers, ranchers and landowners have long been tremendous stewards of our environment. At USDA, we have worked with a record number of producers and landowners over the course of the Obama Administration to help conserve the soil and water, and clean our air - more than half a million over the past four and a half years. Meanwhile, in support of the Climate Action Plan, USDA put forward a series of new policies in June to help agriculture develop new climate solutions in the months and years to come. We have taken steps to create seven new regional climate hubs that will aid in sharing climate information for farmers and ranchers.

"USDA Borlaug Fellow Helps Farmers in His Native Country  Issah Sugri of Ghana is helping his nation feed itself and improve its farmers’ efficiency thanks to a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) program. The Norman E. Borlaug International Agricultural Science and Technology Fellowship Program, funded by USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), is a six to 12 week training program that pairs up-and-coming researchers from selected countries with mentors from a U.S. land-grant institution or government agency. Sugri, one of 36 FAS Borlaug Fellows in , was assigned to the University of Florida with the specific goal of reducing post-harvest losses of tomatoes by better understanding climate-relevant, low-tech methods of extending shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables. When he returned to Ghana, Sugri put his fellowship training to immediate use. Collaborating with fellow researchers at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research – Savannah Agricultural Research Institute (CSIR-SARI), based in Bawku, Ghana, he published fact sheets for local farmers describing optimal harvest and storage conditions. Sugri even included his mobile phone number so he could accept field questions and provide clarification.  He also worked with extension agents to train producers on post-harvest loss avoidance techniques and their economic benefits. At Sugri’s urging, SARI hired a dedicated food scientist to focus additional research on the topic.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Texas in  Conservation  Jul 25,  Simon Winston and his family recently won the national Leopold Conservation Award for their conservation work. In deep East Texas, pine trees are king. Towering pines line the roads and blanket the rolling countryside and national forests. Loblolly and slash pine dominate the landscape in contrast to the area’s historic longleaf pine trees that once reigned. The reduced number of longleaf pines has not gone unnoticed by landowners and conservationists. In response to the striking loss of longleaf pine trees from Texas to Florida, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched the national Longleaf Pine Initiative, which provides technical and financial assistance for conservation practices that help restore longleaf pine forests and enhance existing pine stands. Working alongside NRCS, Simon Winston of Winston 8 Ranch of Nacogdoches, Texas, is one landowner who is doing his part to help restore longleaf pine to its native habitat. In turn, his stewardship efforts are also benefiting native grasses and wildlife populations. “What I like about them is that when they are young you can burn in them,” Winston said. “Loblolly you can’t burn in them until they are bigger.” Prescribed burns are a conservation practice used on longleaf pine forests. Fire reduces moisture and nutrient competition. The elimination of brush and other woody species also allows for native grasses and foraging plants to thrive. In turn, wildlife are drawn to the understory of longleaf pine forests. “We’re getting wild plums and seeing more deer. There’s something for them to eat and for the birds to nest in,” Winston said. “Burning helps establish bluestem grasses which are good nesting habitat for turkeys and quail.” Longleaf pine restoration continues on the Winston 8 Ranch. But the cost of establishing longleaf pine trees can be greater than other pine species. Longleaf seedlings can cost more, and site preparation is a vital component for establishment success. This is where NRCS in partnership with private landowners makes a difference on the landscape. Through the initiative, Winston was able to recover some of the costs associated with seedling establishment and site preparation. In fact, Winston said the financial assistance made a difference in what he was able to accomplish on his ranch. “We’re just trying to make better conservation and do what’s right,” Winston said. “That’s what we do everyday. It’s naturally what we do.” Winston’s dedication to environmental stewardship recently caught the attention of the Sand County Foundation, which honored Winston with the national Leopold Conservation Award. Longleaf pine once covered 90 million acres from Texas to Florida. Today, an estimated 3 percent of these forests remain. Partnerships between NRCS and landowners like Winston can result in improved ecological diversity, wildlife habitat, and increased longleaf pine trees on the landscape of East Texas. NRCS and its many conservation partners are working to reverse the century-long decline in longleaf pine forests through the America’s Longleaf Restoration Initiative. Earlier this week, NRCS joined fellow partners in this initiative to mark the five-year anniversary of creation of the initiative’s Range-wide Conservation Plan for Longleaf Pine.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Working in science can be a real pleasure, especially when your research translates into a life changing experience. The following note from Arion Thiboumery, Vice President of Lorentz Meats and one of the Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education’s (SARE) early Graduate Student grants, submitted a very modest proposal to establish a small-meat processors working group and publish a guide of useful resources. He accomplished that and much more. Read on... About halfway through working on my Ph.D., I came across a recurring problem. My dissertation focused on helping small-scale meat processors expand, upgrade, and build new facilities, essential for allowing smaller, diversified farms to access meat markets and for creating more demand for meat processing. The problem was that butchers were getting older and looking to retire and finding someone young to take over was challenging. The trade of butchering, a practice even older than agriculture itself, was fading due to a lack of job appeal among people my age . With a USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education grant, I developed a training program and resource guides, and helped form one of the most active stakeholder networks in livestock agriculture, now called the Niche Meat Processor Assistance Network. Yet one question haunted me: How could I convince young people to take on this task of being the noble and honest butcher, when I couldn’t convince myself to do it? So I finished my Ph.D. and took a job as a meat processor. That was not an easy decision. Going through 22 years of schooling to slaughter animals for a living might not strike folks as the best use of an education, but I disagree: As we seek to build a more sustainable future, all of us—regardless of profession—need to contribute our talents to build that future. If those of us who feel strongly about butchering don’t contribute, who will? There’s much work to be done in many vocations. And I’m glad to have contributed to this one.

"New Web-Based Tool Helps Land Managers Plan for Forests' Future  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. From South Carolina’s coastal plain to the North Carolina mountains to the tropics of Puerto Rico to the southern Sierra Nevada region of California, climate change is on the minds of forest planners. That’s because U.S. Forest Service planning teams in these areas are among the first to revise their land and resource management plans under the Planning Rule. To help them in their planning, land managers from the Francis Marion, Nantahala, Pisgah, El Yunque, Inyo, Sequoia, and Sierra national forests will turn to a web-based tool known as the Template for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Management Options. Forest Plans help guide the management of national forests and are typically revised every 10 to 15 years.

"Economist at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 13,  Families Projected to Spend an Average of $233,610 Raising a Child Born in . USDA recently issued Expenditures on Children by Families, . This report is also known as “The Cost of Raising a Child.” USDA has been tracking the cost of raising a child since and this analysis examines expenses by age of child, household income, budgetary component, and region of the country. Based on the most recent from the Consumer Expenditures Survey, in , a family will spend approximately $12,980 annually per child in a middle-income ($59,200-$107,400), two-child, married-couple family. Middle-income, married-couple parents of a child born in may expect to spend $233,610 ($284,570 if projected inflation costs are factored in*) for food, shelter, and other necessities to raise a child through age 17. This does not include the cost of a college education. Where does the money go? For a middle-income family, housing accounts for the largest share at 29% of total child-rearing costs.  Food is second at 18%, and child care/education (for those with the expense) is third at 16%. Expenses vary depending on the age of the child. As families often need more room to accommodate children, housing is the largest expense. We did the analysis by household income level, age of the child, and region of residence. Not surprising, the higher a family’s income the more was spent on a child, particularly for child care/education and miscellaneous expenses. Expenses also increase as a child ages.  Overall annual expenses averaged about $300 less for children from birth to 2 years old, and averaged $900 more for teenagers between 15-17 years of age. Teenagers have higher food costs as well as higher transportation costs as these are the years they start to drive so insurance is included or a maybe a second car is purchased for them. Regional variation was also observed. Families in the urban Northeast spent the most on a child, followed by families in the urban West, urban South, and urban Midwest.  Families in rural areas throughout the country spent the least on a child—child-rearing expenses were 27% lower in rural areas than the urban Northeast, primarily due to lower housing and child care/education expenses. Child-rearing expenses are subject to economies of scale. That is, with each additional child, expenses on each declines. For married-couple families with one child, expenses averaged 27% more per child than expenses in a two-child family.  For families with three or more children, per child expenses averaged 24% less on each child than on a child in a two-child family.  This is sometimes referred to as the “cheaper by the dozen” effect. Each additional child costs less because children can share a bedroom; a family can buy food in larger, more economical quantities; clothing and toys can be handed down; and older children can often babysit younger ones. Food costs have decreased over the years thanks to increased efficiency in American agriculture. This report is one of many ways that USDA works to support American families through our programs and work. It outlines typical spending by families from across the country, and is used in a number of ways to help support and education American families.  Courts and state governments use this to inform their decisions about child support and foster care payments.  Financial planners use the information to provide advice to their clients, and families can access our Cost of Raising a Child calculator, which we update with every report on our website, to look at spending patterns for families similar to theirs. This Calculator is one of many tools available on MyMoney.gov, a government research and clearinghouse related to financial education. This year we released the report at a time when families are thinking about their plans for the New Year.  We’ve been focusing on nutrition-related New Year’s resolutions – or what we are referring to as Real Solutions - on our MyPlate website, ChooseMyPlate.gov.  This report and the updated calculator can help families as they focus on financial health resolutions.  This report will provide families with a greater awareness of the expenses they are likely to face while raising children. In addition to the report and the calculator, we also have a dedicated section on ChooseMyPlate.gov that provides tips and tools to aid families and individuals in making healthy choices while staying on a budget. For strategies beyond food, our friends at MyMoney.gov offer a wealth of information to help Americans plan for their financial future.

I was privileged to go to the State of Mississippi on Dec. 9, for a HealthierUS School Challenge event.  Actually, I was there for three events and 11 schools received either USDA’s Gold of Distinction Awards or Gold Awards.  One of the six schools that was recognized for the Gold of Distinction Award was Purvis High School in Purvis, Miss.  This school is actually the first high school in the country to win this award and counting the other five Gold of Distinction award winners; these six schools are the first in Mississippi to be recognized for this particular award. Certainly nutrition staff, along with parents, teachers and students, have played a huge role in Lamar County School District’s success. The Child Nutrition Department for the district has a centralized menu providing daily:  four entrees, chef or specialty salads, three to four fruit and vegetable choices, and whole grain bread and croutons baked daily.  An annual PTO Academy is conducted keeping parents and faculty abreast of wellness policy regulations and fresh ideas on healthier snacks and fundraising. In addition, some of the schools have their own gardens. Some require walking a few laps around the track or field before starting free play at recess.  The Child Nutrition Staff has a lot of training every year in food preparation and presentation, and whole grain breads are baked from scratch daily at all of the schools. I think you can readily see why Lamar County School District is an outstanding organization that encourages wellness.  So many of its schools are providing an excellent nutrition environment and exercise opportunities for their students.  I was encouraged by what I saw and I hope many more schools will follow Lamar County School District’s example.      USDA’s HealthierUS School Challenge recognizes schools that create and maintain healthy school environments by promoting good nutrition and physical activity.  It’s a key component of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! campaign to end childhood obesity within a generation.

"USDA Program Helps High School Students Realize Ag Jobs are Everywhere  Here at the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), one of the many benefits of creating marketing opportunities for ag businesses is seeing first-hand how the industry supports 1 in 12 jobs all over the country. In addition to feeding the world, the ag industry continues to be the strong backbone in our nation’s economy – in both rural and urban areas. To help continue this trend, we set out to groom the next generation of ag leaders. Our Fruit and Vegetable Program developed a strong relationship with high schools in a couple of the country’s largest cities, allowing students to work with the agency while still enrolled in high school. We started in New York City, home of the Hunt’s Point Terminal Market – the nation’s largest wholesale produce market – so that students at John Bowne High School could get their feet wet in the agriculture industry. We did this by offering the students the opportunity to come on board as interns for our Specialty Crops Inspection Division (SCI). Employees in this division inspect produce entering and leaving Hunt’s Point, which employs more than 10,000 people and generates $2 billion in sales annually. Thanks to a budding relationship with this school featuring a strong ag curriculum, students can now get practical work experience while in school.  Lorenzo A.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Programs Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 19,   USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) recently became a participant in the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) Internship Program, which brings students to Washington, DC, to gain valuable working experience.  This is the first year that our agency has participated in this program. AMS is utilizing our relationship with AAPD to create a more diverse workforce, one that includes more employees with disabilities.  We understand the importance of designing employment practices that consider the needs of all employees.  A diverse workforce introduces everyone to unique perspectives that ultimately help us find innovative approaches to solving problems and solidifying our business model.  This is one of the ways AMS can continue to provide services that benefit everyone in the greater public. This summer, Maya Ariel, an undergraduate student studying business administration at Rochester Institute of Technology, joined AMS as an intern for the agency’s Fruit and Vegetable Programs.  In her position, Maya, who is Deaf, helps Christopher Purdy, the program’s business development specialist, identify ways for AMS to partner with other organizations and market the program’s services.  By providing Maya with the accommodations she needs to be successful, AMS has gained a truly valuable team member. AMS values its partnerships with diverse organizations, such as AAPD, that enable us to identify, attract and recruit top-tier talent.  We encourage students to take advantage of the internship program so that they can become familiar with the agency and learn about other career opportunities. We support AAPD’s belief that people with disabilities are an important and intricate part of diversity in the workforce. AAPD recently came to USDA Headquarters to chronicle a day in the life of an intern.  Video footage of Ariel and the rest of the AAPD interns’ summer experiences will be available by visiting the AAPD Internship Program Web site in the early fall.

"Make a Cafeteria Date to Eat a Healthy Lunch with Your Child at School  More than 50 million children around the country attend schools that participate in USDA’s National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Programs.  And not only are their meals full of nutritious ingredients – with 99 percent of schools nationwide reporting that they are successfully meeting the updated nutrition standards – their entire learning environment fosters healthy habits now and throughout the rest of their lives.  During National School Lunch Week , USDA and partners like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, are celebrating this progress.  It’s National School Lunch Week and this year we have more to celebrate than ever before! Over the past decade, significant policy changes have sparked a national movement that has transformed the school nutrition landscape and created a new healthier era for school foods. Many of these policies were initiated by USDA, including updated nutrition standards for the meals and snacks schools offer, as well as updated requirements for local wellness policies. Thanks to these developments and incredible efforts by schools to put them in place, millions of students across America not only have healthier meals, snacks, and drinks at school – they’re also learning healthy habits that will last a lifetime.

"USDA Food and Nutrition Service Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 07,  The USDA Farm to School Planning Toolkit provides school districts helpful questions to consider and resources to reference when building their programs. Healthy habits are taking root in our nation’s schools.  Thanks to an important commitment made possible by the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of , more of our nation’s kids are being exposed to lessons about healthy eating and learning where their food comes from.  Established as part of that legislation, USDA’s Farm to School Program plays a vital role in improving health outcomes for our schoolchildren. This October, during National Farm to School Month, it’s important to acknowledge farm to school programs’ contributions to fostering a healthier next generation.  These programs support the work of parents, teachers, school nutrition professionals, and communities to make sure the healthy choice is the easy choice for America’s children. Farm to school brings local or regionally produced foods into school cafeterias; hands-on learning activities such as school gardening, farm visits, and culinary classes; and the integration of food-related education into the classroom curriculum.  To help schools create or strengthen an existing program, we recently launched the Farm to School Planning Toolkit to provide tips and examples, insights, and research-based resources.  The accessible guide enables schools, school districts and community partners to map out and build on their program’s vision. In USDA’s vision, school cafeterias championing U.S. agriculture and promoting local foods are the norm, not the exception.  Local foods span the school meal tray and include everything from the salad bar and fresh fruit and vegetable servings to the wheat in the pizza crust, beans in the chili, rice in the stir fry, turkey in the sandwiches, and cheese in the quesadillas. Research shows that children in schools with farm to school programs eat more fruits and vegetables and are more willing to try new, healthy foods—positive steps in the right direction in the battle against childhood obesity.   By instilling smarter, more nutritious behaviors, we make it easier for our future leaders to grow, thrive and reach their highest potential.  USDA understands that schools have unique circumstances and needs and have constructed a roadmap to ensure long-term success for any type of farm to school program.  We’re proud to say that farm to school programs now exist in every state and in every type of district – large and small, rural and urban alike.  Designed with this in mind, the toolkit offers eleven focus areas including sections on building your program, buying local, menu planning and promoting your program. The toolkit is just one way USDA is there to help schools dig in with their farm to school programs. A new video will be featured throughout October.

"Animals  Plants  Jun 17,   Written by Bill Wood, State Biologist, AlaskaLet’s say you’ve just awakened from a restless 6-month nap. You check on the kids and it seems like everyone is really hungry. On your way to the grocery store you pass a chicken take-out joint and the smell of those fryers is irresistible. With kids in tow, you perambulate into the unattended shop; by all appearances, it seems you may have discovered the proverbial “free lunch.” Who could say no? This happens for scores of mammas and pappas all over the Kenai Peninsula every spring—mamma and pappa bears, that is. And it’s not just chicken on the menu. Equally delectable items like dog food, honey and fish, not to mention livestock feed, a wide variety of human foods and other attractive items draw hungry bears that are just following their natural instincts. Bears spend as much as 80 percent of their waking day feeding or foraging for food. So when they’re rewarded for their efforts with a fairly easy meal and experience no negative repurcussions, they can quickly become habituated to that attraction. Bears can be destructive and these situations can potentially be dangerous for all involved. Chicken coops, beehives, smokehouses and the like can quickly become demolition sites with lost equipment, money, time and effort. Sometimes encounters between humans and bears don’t turn out so well for the people, but they never turn out well for the bear. People can be proactive in reducing the potential for these kinds of human-bear encounters in a few important and sensible ways. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) helps provide solutions for issues like this one. WHIP’s cost-share funding assistance is used to improve a wide variety of wildlife habitat conditions and help reduce negative impacts to wildlife species on private land. For the fiscal year, NRCS has developed a new initiative available to landowners only on the Kenai Peninsula. The new project idea seeks to reduce potential up-close-and-personal interactions between people and bears at sites of human-induced bear attractants and provides matching funding to landowners to install permanent electric bear fencing. This type of fencing is an effective technique to exclude bears from areas where they should not seek food. After receiving their first shock, many bears seem to sense the electrical charge in the fence lines and avoid those fences. When the fences are properly designed, even their appearance can remind bears of their previous unpleasant encounter. NRCS, in cooperation with Alaska Department of Fish and Game, will also provide fence designs and site management plans and recommendations for the installation of the fences. Site inventory and assessment is part of the technical assistance landowners will receive, in addition to help with purchase and installation costs. To find out more about the program contact the NRCS Kenai Field Office at 283-, the NRCS Homer Field Office at 235-, or the office of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in Kenai at 262-.

"Acting Deputy Under Secretary, USDA Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 01,  Visit DietaryGuidelines.gov to learn more about the process of developing the DGA. Interested in being part of our process as we develop the - Dietary for Americans (DGA)? Start today at DietaryGuidelines.gov. Coinciding with the beginning of National Nutrition Month®, we are excited to announce, along with our partners at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), a new step early in the process to develop the - DGA. For the first time, USDA and HHS are posting for public comment the topics and supporting scientific questions to be examined at the start of the DGA development process. The public comment period will be open until March 30, . This important, new step reflects our continued commitment to ensure that the DGA development process is transparent, inclusive, and science-driven – and to incorporate recommendations and feedback on the process received from stakeholders. Transparency and customer service are among the key tenets that guide our decisions at USDA. The American taxpayer is an essential customer – indeed, a shareholder. We are proud to take this important step forward toward greater transparency and ensure that the American public’s voice is heard throughout this process. As you review the topics and supporting scientific questions posted for public consideration and comment, it’s important to note the following:  Life stage approach: USDA and HHS are proposing a life stage approach for this edition of the DGA, focusing on priority scientific questions from birth through older adulthood. This approach is a new opportunity due in part to audience expansion, per the Farm Bill, which mandated that starting with the - edition, the DGA provide guidance for women who are pregnant, as well as infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months.  Criteria: The topics USDA and HHS are posting for public comment for the - DGA are based on four criteria: relevance (topic is within scope of the DGA and its focus on food-based recommendations, not clinical for medical treatment); importance (topic for which there is new, relevant and represents an area of substantial public health concern, uncertainty, and/or knowledge gap); potential federal impact (probability that guidance on the topic would inform federal food and nutrition policies and programs); and avoiding duplication (topic is not currently addressed through existing evidence-based federal guidance, other than the Dietary ). As we go through this multiyear process to update and publish the - DGA, it’s also important to note that as the Dietary has evolved over the decades, it isn’t about focusing on individual foods or food groups. We are looking at what we eat and drink as a whole, and how that can help prevent diseases and keep people healthy. As you will see in the months and years leading up to the release of the - DGA, our process will include new approaches to provide the public with more transparency and opportunities to participate. We welcome your voice as we work hard to deliver on our continued commitment to our customers – you. You can find additional information on the DGA process at DietaryGuidelines.gov.

The pilot determined that an ongoing investment of less than 15 cents per person per day may result in a 25 percent increase in fruit and vegetable consumption among adults. Adults receiving the HIP incentive consumed, on average, an ounce more fruits and vegetables per day than non-participants.""Although healthy foods aren't necessarily more expensive, many low income people face time and resource challenges when it comes to putting healthy food on the table that can make less healthy options seem more appealing,"" said Vilsack. ""The results of the Healthy Incentives Pilot demonstrate the clear impact that promoting nutritious food choices can have on improving the healthfulness of SNAP purchases.""Vilsack also highlighted ongoing public-private efforts that provide support and incentives to SNAP participants to purchase more healthy foods. He cited a pilot project in Minnesota that offers $5 coupons to SNAP households for the purchase of fresh fruits and vegetables and a pilot project in Michigan to make locally sourced produce available in corner grocery stores in metropolitan Detroit.""Research to date shows that incentives can work, but we know that no single solution can solve the problems of poor diet and obesity among American children and families,"" said Vilsack. ""That is why we are supporting a broad spectrum of SNAP-focused strategies that empower low-income families to purchase more healthy foods.""Providing science-based nutrition advice and expanding the availability of healthy food to all Americans is a major goal of USDA's nutrition assistance programs and this Administration. The strategies highlighted today complement other initiatives underway at USDA to promote healthy eating by all Americans, including:USDA's Food and Nutrition Service oversees the administration of 15 nutrition assistance programs, including SNAP, that touch the lives of one in four Americans over the course of a year.

"What is composting? Composting is the process of recycling organic materials into an amendment that can be used to enrich soil and plants. Types of Compost Bins Typical Compost Bin Tumbler Compost Bin Worm Compost Bin Why Compost? Food scraps and yard waste currently make up 20 to 30 percent of what we throw away. USDA is fighting food waste and you can too. Composting is nature’s way of recycling! Here are a few reasons to get started today:  Feed the soil without using chemical fertilizers.  Keep food waste out of the landfills and prevent greenhouse gas emissions.  Conserve water by building healthy soils. Get Started There are different ways to get started composting today. You can start a backyard composting bin or use worms to do the work. Backyard composting in three easy steps:  Choose a location. A good site is dry in either the sun or partial shade.  Set-up your compost bin. Purchase a compost bin or create an inexpensive bin with wire mesh and 3-4 poles for support.  Get composting. Include 2-3 parts “brown material” (fall leaves, twigs, shredded newspaper, straw, wood chips, and shredded wood) and 1 part “green material” (vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, crushed eggshells, garden and grass clippings, tea bags without staples) by volume then add water to keep moist. Don’t forget to turn your pile! A monthly rotation is a good rule of thumb. Worm Composting Setup:  Select Container. Purchase a worm bin or make your own from a plastic or wood storage container. Worm bins require holes drilled for aeration and drainage. There are several online sources with instructions to create a worm bin.  Locate bin. The ideal temperature for worm composting is 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate the worm bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.  Worm Bin Setup:  Worms need bedding such as a mixture of non-glossy paper, cardboard, or leaves. Soak the material for 10 minutes, wring out the water so it is moist but not saturated, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.  Now you are ready to add your worms. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only 7 are suitable for vermicomposting. The most widely used species is the “red wiggler” which you can buy from a worm grower.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center in  Conservation  Jun 23,  FWC Photo by Andy Wraithmell, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Did you know the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil scientists are playing an important role in saving Florida’s manatees? These giant, but gentle, creatures are adored by residents and visitors to Florida. Unfortunately, though, their numbers have been threatened in recent years throughout the state. Manatees in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon (IRL), which stretches 156 miles along Florida’s eastern coast, have been starving to death at an alarming rate over the last two years. These deaths can be attributed to a lack of seagrass, their main source of food, which is being affected by algal blooms. As the algae blooms destroy seagrass beds, it causes sediment to float to the water’s surface. The water goes from clear to murky, making it harder for light to penetrate the water and provide sustenance to the seagrass. This creates a vicious cycle where more seagrass dies, more sunlight is blocked, and the manatees are left with less food to eat. NRCS is part of a team working to address the challenge, along with St. Johns River Water Management District, the University of Florida, among many other national and state agencies. The scientists go out on the IRL in pontoon boats and use sonar to conduct underwater soil surveys to gather information on the healthiest areas and the most degraded areas of the lagoon. The information is used to decide where to concentrate restoration efforts. This information has helped improve lagoons through actions like clams, oysters, and seagrass being deployed to aid in filtering and clearing the water. Scientists hope that continued improvement will eventually lead to the full restoration of manatees in the IRL.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Dec 20,  Years ago, I spent my days watching pecan roots change the color of solutions from clear to red as they reduced iron for uptake. It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children’s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics. Now, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I’m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change. As an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce. My internship introduced me to the importance of agricultural research and attracted me to a career where I could use science to inform agricultural policy.

"USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  May 25,  Veteran Tray Middlebrooks grew up in Merritt Island, Florida, and Manassas, Virginia. After college, he wanted to follow a reliable and purposeful path forward. He went on to serve 10 years of active duty as an Air Force medic stationed in Nevada and Florida followed by three years in the Florida reserves. Post-service, Tray found it challenging to secure permanent, fulltime employment. He found a temporary position working for the U.S. Small Business Administration, but his goal was to secure a permanent federal position. Fortunately, Tray met USDA Military Veterans Agricultural Liaison (MVAL) Monshi “Ram” Ramdass. Ram helped Tray narrow his search and navigate the federal application process, helping him be successful. “I kept on applying and kept on applying,” Tray said. “I am here today because Ram did not give up on my career placement.” Today Tray is a loan specialist with USDA’s Rural Development in South Carolina. He is the team lead for his area and serves on a planning committee to help streamline the loan application process. His day-to-day work involves helping individuals and families in rural communities work towards their own goals, which he finds a rewarding use of his experience. He believes veterans can bring great experience to the government, including leadership, a strong work ethic, reliability and integrity. He wants fellow veterans to know that they, too, can be successful in the federal workforce by using the skills they gained in the military, such as the ability to work well with others to achieve common goals. “You can apply your military experience to a government position that will allow you to continue to serve your country in a new way,” he said. “We know how to work, replicate, teach and lead to reach team goals.” His boss agrees. “Tray has brought a wealth of knowledge and excellent leadership skills to our agency,” said USDA Rural Development South Carolina State Director Dr. Saundra Glover. “I believe his military experience helped him perfect those skills, which he uses daily when helping individuals from diverse backgrounds apply for home loans or grants under our Single-Family Housing Programs, working with lenders or entrepreneurs interested in our Business and Cooperatives Programs, or connecting with leaders from surrounding rural communities and providing them information about our Community Facilities Programs or Water and Environmental Programs.” USDA welcomes veterans like Tray and the many skills they can bring to the agency.

"Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19?  Last year, as COVID-19 rattled the world economy and disrupted trade flows, agricultural trade remained mostly stable, falling only two percent during the initial wave of infections and lockdowns, before bouncing back and ending the year up 3.5 percent. But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.

"USDA state-by-state show top states for Federal local food investments include Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas and Alabama  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, June 30, — Today, the Obama Administration invited communities to participate in Local Foods, Local Places, a federal initiative providing direct technical support to build strong local food systems as part of a community's emerging economic action plans. Under this effort, a team of agricultural, transportation, public health, environmental, and regional economic experts will work directly with local communities to spur local economic growth and improve the quality of life for all residents.Local food sales topped $11.7 billion in according to industry estimates, underscoring the economic benefit that a local food system can offer a community. As part of today's announcement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released an updated state-by-state ""Made in Rural America"" report illustrating the impact of USDA's investments in rural communities, including local food. USDA has invested more than $800 million in more than 29,100 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects over the past six years.""These state by state analyses reaffirm that local food is rapidly growing from a niche market to an integrated system recognized for its economic boost to communities across the country,"" said Secretary Vilsack. ""Local food creates new market opportunities for farmers, brings fresh meals into schools and other institutions, expands healthy food access to underserved communities, and builds infrastructure needed to support ranchers and other meat processors. By investing in projects at the local level, this Administration is encouraging growth in this sector and creating new opportunities for families who live in rural America.""This is the second year of the Local Foods, Local Places program. In , 26 rural and urban communities participated in the program to create year-round, downtown markets featuring foods from local farmers; establish retail outlets to help revitalize small-town main streets; build centrally located community kitchens or food hubs to aggregate and market local foods; support business incubators to help entrepreneurs start food-related businesses on main streets; enhance public spaces for people to walk or bicycle to farmers markets and local restaurants; assist schoolchildren to grow their own food and make healthy local food accessible to families, including via SNAP benefits; and develop community gardens in walkable, transit-accessible places.Technical support teams through Local Foods, Local Places helped Osceola, Arkansas (pop 7,700) develop a new health foods cooking curriculum for the local school district, create a plan for a new downtown farmers market and implement infrastructure improvement efforts; guided North Little Rock, Arkansas (population 62,000) to enhance the livability of an emerging neighborhood though a new food hub; and worked with Wheeling, West Virginia (pop 28,000) to revitalize underused property into a community orchard, multi-use food facility, and a mobile market.Local Foods, Local Places is a partnership between USDA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DoT), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Delta Regional Authority (DRA). The effort is part of the White House Rural Council's ""Rural Impact"" effort to improve quality of life and upward mobility for kids and families in rural and tribal communities. Together, the agencies are investing $800,000 to support this round of assistance. Application and deadlines are available on line.Since , USDA has invested in 29,100 food hubs, small scale processing, farmers market and other opportunities in local food across all 50 states and the US territories. This includes USDA investments in the local food sector through over 12,000 microloans, smaller loans of up to $50,000 for small-scale producers who often sell products locally; and over 13,000 high tunnels, low-cost covered structures that extend the growing season and make locally-grown products available later into the year.Among the top ten states with federally funded local food projects are Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Michigan. Five of these states (Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and West Virginia) are part USDA's StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity which coordinates USDA assistance in the Nation's most economically challenged rural areas.Many of these projects can be found on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass. Searchable by state, zip code, project type and funding program, the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass maps federal local food investments made by USDA and 10 other federal agencies between fiscal years -. The Compass is part of the USDA's Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative. Secretary Vilsack has identified local and regional food systems as one of the four pillars of rural economic development, along with production agriculture, the bio-based economy, and natural resources and conservation.The state by state fact sheets are available at www.usda.gov/opportunities.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator in  Trade  Oct 22,  Trade visitors sample a variety of cheeses at the Rogue Creamery stand in the USA Pavilion. Rogue Creamery, an artisan cheese company, is dedicated to sustainability and the art and tradition of making the world's finest handmade cheese. Earlier this week I traveled to Paris to attend the 24th edition of the Salon International d’Alimentation (SIAL). This 5-day event is one of the largest international food and beverage trade exhibitions in the world, attracting 5,500 exhibitors and over 147,000 trade-only visitors representing 188 countries. I was very impressed by the wide variety of U.S. products on display and by the number of participating countries. For nearly 20 years, the United States has participated in SIAL Paris. This year’s USA Pavilion at SIAL was the largest to date, with some 140 exhibitors occupying over 2,700 square meters. SIAL offers U.S. food exporters the opportunity to test products and meet with European as well as other international traders and industry professionals. Clearly, this is a major factor for the large U.S. presence. One of my primary reasons for attending the show was to meet face to face with U.S. Cooperators, exhibitors, and importers from Europe and other regions, as well as industry leaders. I had the pleasure of talking with many small- and medium-sized companies and Cooperator groups who expressed their appreciation of our programs and services, including American Food Service, Head Country Food Products, Rogue Creamery, U.S. Meat Export Federation, USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, and representatives from the state regional trade groups (SRTG), just to name a few. Tuesday night’s SRTG-hosted trade reception, as well as an industry reception, was yet another wonderful opportunity to talk with Pavilion exhibitors and trade visitors. Reception guests included buyer groups from North Africa and the Middle East recruited by our FAS Field offices. The European Union (EU) is a major trading partner for the United States. The EU is America’s fifth largest market for agricultural and food products. France alone imports nearly $1 billion of U.S. farm goods annually. However, the scope of SIAL extended beyond the EU, reaching importers from all corners of the world. Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products. Looking back on the response of visitors to the wide variety of U.S. food and beverage products showcased in the Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong, and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome, and innovative products is excellent. For information on other upcoming trade events, please visit our home page at www.fas.usda.gov or contact Maria.Nemeth-Ek@fas.usda.gov.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Sep 11,   Evelyn Eagleman, 63, remembers driving the long distance off Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation, Mont., to rescue her grandson when he was two. His father was serving in the military and his mother had been arrested on drug charges.  The boy needed a new start. She brought the child home to Rocky Boy, where she and her husband, Francis, became the child’s foster parents.  Her grandson, now a teenager, will soon graduate from high school and plans to major in forestry in college.  Eagleman said she and her husband are proud of the man he has become and gives much credit to the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program at Stone Child College, in Box Elder, Mont. “There are a lot of legal issues involved with foster parenting, and I can’t remember them all, but with this program, I know where to go for help,” she said.   “We learned about our rights as foster grandparents.” The Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) through its Tribal College Extension Grant program. This grant allows land-grants institutions, also known as tribal colleges, to provide education to reservation communities. The 32 colleges and universities that receive this funding provide a host of services, depending on the community needs. Stone Child College uses its grant for many youth-focused outreach efforts, as well as the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program.  According to Mary St. Pierre, the Extension project director and leader of the grandparent program, about 10 percent of the community’s children are being raised by grandparents. The U.S. Census that, nationally, 7 million grandparents had grandchildren living with them, a 64 percent increase since . In about one-third of these cases grandparents had assumed a custodial role. The Census that for American Indians, 97,278 grandparents live with their grandchildren and more than half have primary custodial responsibility.  Many times, the parent lives with the family, too, as it is with the Eagleman’s. St. Pierre’s next goal for NIFA’s Tribal College Extension Grant program is to develop a Positive Indian Parenting program that will accompany the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Health and Safety  Animals  Plants  May 09,  USDA is taking a multi-faceted approach to supporting the American sheep and lamb industry, working with researchers and market analysts to identify strategies and goals. The U.S. sheep and lamb industry has been shrinking for decades as the numbers of sheep and producers have declined since World War II.  Consolidation of the sheep packing industry, higher feed and energy costs, continuous loses to predation, and lower consumption, coupled with competition from imports of lamb cuts, have taken their toll on U.S. producers.  In response to industry needs, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has been working with the American Lamb Board (ALB) and the American Sheep Industry Association (ASI) on initiatives aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of the industry. The ALB recently initiated a study to identify the challenges, propose solutions, and develop strategies to strengthen the industry’s competitive advantage.  By working with a marketing firm and using and services offered by USDA, ALB hopes this study’s findings will help return the industry to profitability.  AMS is ready to assist ALB as they lay the groundwork and identify goals and benchmarks. Another way AMS is assisting the industry is in identifying opportunities to improve Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) for lamb.  LMR was established to collect and publish price and volume information to encourage competition in the marketplace.  However, given the consolidation of the industry, it has become difficult to publish lamb market information on a consistent basis due to the LMR confidentiality requirements.  Last fall, ASI commissioned the Livestock Marketing Information Center (LMIC) to conduct a study of the LMR program, and over the course of 5 months, met with AMS to learn more about how USDA administers the lamb reporting program. The final report proposed improvement recommendations to lamb reporting.  Some of the recommendations included lowering the reporting thresholds for packers and importers, evaluating the confidentiality policy for LMR, and eliminating categories and that do not have utility. AMS has reviewed the report and is engaged with ASI to determine the best solutions for the recommendations.  While some of the recommendations will require regulatory changes, many of the proposals can be addressed easily.  In fact, AMS has already eliminated the western regional lamb , changed the National daily lamb report to a weekly report, modified the reported weight categories, and removed unused purchase type categories. AMS is working with ASI on other projects, such as determining ways in which slaughter lambs are bought to ensure that the LMR purchase types are still relevant.  AMS is also working to develop strategies to more accurately define the lamb maturity window for the grade standards and will work with FSIS on a more agreeable term for “yearling mutton” such as “yearling lamb.” AMS and ASI are cooperating on the potential development of a lamb tenderness standard, and the potential development of a non-hormone treated lamb export certification protocol with the European Union. The ALB and ASI recently received USDA approval to explore lamb instrument grading, through funding received from the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center.  The project will be a two phased approach to finalizing USDA’s standardization of the concept and evaluating the benefits and return on the investment to garner industry acceptance. The USDA is committed to working with our partners in the industry to not only meet these challenges but to succeed in creating an industry that provides quality products to consumers and increased producer returns here at home.

"Vermont Says 'Thank You' to Massachusetts for Fighting Invasive Beetle  The Vermont maple syrup industry is well aware that an invasive, tree-killing insect could threaten the production of its delicious, all-natural commodity.  So on December 13, just four days before National Maple Syrup Day on December 17, the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers Association and Vermont state officials hosted a special pancake and maple syrup breakfast to thank partners for supporting the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) eradication program in Massachusetts.

Photo by A. Jay, Chun-Li Integrated Marketing and Communications Co., Ltd Thanks to Foreign Agricultural Service employees serving at USDA’s 98 international posts, American Thanksgiving traditions – and food – are being enjoyed around the world this November.  This is certainly the case in Taiwan, where the Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Taipei teamed with China TV to highlight the holiday on an episode of the popular TV show “King of the Happy Life” this week. Valerie Brown from ATO Taipei was joined by Daisy Hong, who represents the grower-owned cooperative Ocean Spray, and chef C.K. Chen from Taipei’s Sherwood Hotel. In addition to Thanksgiving staples like turkey and pumpkin pie, they featured new recipes, including stuffing and hot cranberry-apple cider made with Ocean Spray products. After taping the show, Chen began taking orders for traditional American Thanksgiving baskets, which the Sherwood Hotel sells every year. Not only do these baskets feature traditional American dishes, many of the ingredients are exported by the United States, including turkey, cranberries, broccoli, potatoes, beets, lettuce and California wine. Following the Thanksgiving episode of “King of the Happy Life” last year, Chen was so overwhelmed with orders that he had to limit the number of baskets available this year. The popularity of these Thanksgiving baskets is reflective of increased demand for U.S. food and agriculture around the world.  Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that U.S. agricultural exports reached a record $137.4 billion in fiscal year , which exceeds the previous record by $22.5 billion. The agricultural trade surplus soared to a record $42.7 billion in FY. This rise in exports is good news for all Americans, especially considering every $1 billion of U.S. agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs. Last year alone, agricultural exports helped support 1.15 million jobs. And that gives us all a reason to be thankful.

"Director, USDA Agricultural Trade Office, Tokyo in  Trade  Mar 27,   Helping U.S. exporters tap into Japan’s $670 billion food market is a top priority for the Foreign Agricultural Service’s Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Japan. One way we do this is by organizing the USA Pavilion at FOODEX Japan, the largest food and beverage trade show in Asia. This year’s show, which was held March 6-9, drew 74,000-plus attendees, not just from Japan but also from other Asian markets including Korea, Taiwan, China, Thailand and Hong Kong. U.S. Ambassador to Japan John V. Roos (right) visits a U.S. organic onion exhibit at the USDA-endorsed FOODEX Japan. The food and beverage show took place March 6-9 and is the largest show of its kind in Asia. The U.S. Pavilion was one of the largest at the show and featured more than 70 companies. (Photo Courtesy of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo) The USA Pavilion was one of the largest at the show, featuring more than 70 U.S. companies and a wide range of “Made in America” products, including meat and seafood, fresh produce, wine and specialty snack foods. Participants had an opportunity to showcase their wares to key decision-makers from restaurants, supermarkets, wholesalers, grocery stores, foodservice and hospitality companies, fast food chains and convenience stores, as well as distributors, agents and brokers. Japan is the world’s third-largest economy and the United States’ fourth-largest agricultural export customer, purchasing a record $15.6 billion of U.S. agricultural, forestry and fishery goods in . For U.S. companies, entry into the lucrative Japanese market is often the first step towards expansion to the rest of Asia. That’s why our ATO strives to help U.S. companies shine at the FOODEX show, providing logistical support and briefings, offering samples of U.S. products at a “Gateway to American Food” demonstration area, and helping match U.S. exhibitors with potential business contacts. While final results from the show are not yet in, a preliminary survey indicates U.S. exhibitors made more than $13 million in projected sales. Over three years, more than 1,000 U.S. companies and organizations—about 70 percent of them small and medium sized businesses—participated in 87 USDA-endorsed trade shows in 20 countries. On-site sales totaled more than $350 million and 12-month projected sales reported by exhibitors were estimated more than $2.7 billion. The companies made over 42,000 business contacts and displayed nearly 20,000 new products in various markets on all continents.  Trade shows give companies even more opportunities to make business contacts and share their products with potential buyers and consumers. Currently, the American brand of agriculture is surging in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year reached a record high of $137.4 billion—exceeding past highs by $22.5 billion—and supported 1.15 million jobs here at home.

"Taking Charge: How Rural Residents Are Switching from Employees to Business Owners  The retirement of the baby boom generation of business proprietors is predicted to result in a major turnover in ownership. Developing an ownership succession plan is especially challenging in rural areas where many small businesses are at risk of closing from the lack of locally available financing to keep them in operation. Rural Development’s Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program now has new capabilities as of this August that specifically accommodate the needs of financing ownership succession. B&I guarantee borrowers can now apply to loans for financing the transfer of business ownership within a family, usually involving a sale from parents to children. Prior to recent changes in the rules it was assumed that within families the transfer of ownership was always a seller-financed transaction. Yet, some retiring business owners may need to immediately take the sales revenue out to finance their retirement.

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world’s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack’s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA’s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization’s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA’s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA’s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways.

"Assistant to the Director, USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  May 24,   Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog:  There’s a lot going on in the Church Hill North neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia! For three years, the congregation at 31st Street Baptist Church has been growing fresh vegetables in an urban garden behind their church. More recently, they launched a healthy living campaign to encourage the congregation and the surrounding community to get active and eat more nutritious foods. Led by Rev. Dr. Henderson, who serves as senior pastor, 31st Street Baptist Church has acquired three city lots behind their church. The congregants have a large community garden with 24 cultivated raised beds in one of the lots. The garden provides healthy, fresh produce to a community without close access to a grocery store. The majority of the produce from the garden is used in the church’s nutrition center, which has served members of the local community for 21 years and receives some of its food via USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance (TEFAP) program. The 31st Street Baptist Church garden is already growing peas, radishes, beets, and greens this season. Photo courtesy of Master Gardener Linda Marshall and Jacquelin Henderson 31st Street Baptist Church provides a great example of how to partner with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on multiple fronts. The church has partnered with Virginia Cooperative Extension and local master gardeners for technical assistance in growing food and teaching about nutrition. They will be starting a 4-H youth development club with two neighboring churches and teenagers from the Mayor’s Youth Conservation Corps also help tend part of the garden. The church has plans to launch a large farmers market this summer with produce from the garden and area farmers, and they will be holding a youth summer camp focused on healthy living in August. And there’s more: this spring marked the planting of a new flower garden in one of their other lots. The plan is to sell the cut flowers to other churches in the area to raise revenue and teach youth about entrepreneurship. The third open lot will be developed as a Zen garden, providing a space for tranquility in the neighborhood. Pastor Henderson’s goal is to “rally congregants around changing their lifestyles” while “respecting the dignity of the people who come to garden.” To learn more about increasing access to healthy affordable food in your community, please visit Let’s Move!

"U.S. Navy, Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy Announce Funding Available for Commercial Scale Advanced Drop-In Biofuels; Energy Department Also Announces Additional Biofuel Investments to Drive Cost Reductions and Technological Breakthroughs  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .12  Contact:USDA Office of Communications   720-  AudioWASHINGTON. D.C., July 2, – As part of the Obama Administration's commitment to deploying every available source of American energy and reducing our reliance on imported oil, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced new funding available to pursue new innovations in biofuels technologies, increase production of U.S. biofuels, and strengthen American energy security. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Navy and Department of Energy are announcing $30 million in federal funding to match private investments in commercial-scale advanced drop-in biofuels. The Energy Department is also announcing a total of $32 million in new investments for earlier stage research that will continue to drive technological breakthroughs and additional cost reductions in the industry.Advancing Commercial-Scale Drop-In Biofuel Substitutes for Diesel and Jet FuelIn his Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future released in March , President Obama set a goal of reducing oil imports by one-third by and laid out an all-of-the-above energy plan to achieve that goal by developing domestic oil and gas energy resources, increasing energy efficiency, and speeding development of biofuels and other alternatives. Domestic oil and gas production has increased each year the President has been in office. At the same time we continue to take additional steps to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. As part of that effort, the Blueprint directed the Navy, USDA and DOE to collaborate to support commercialization of ""drop-in"" biofuel substitutes for diesel and jet fuel. Competitively-priced drop-in biofuels will help improve America's energy security, meeting the fuel needs of U.S. armed forces, as well as the commercial aviation and shipping sectors. Today's announcement of an available $30 million in funding builds on that commitment, helping to speed the development of biofuels for military and commercial transportation that will reduce the need for foreign oil and strengthen rural America. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is available HERE.Made possible through the Defense Production Act (DPA), this funding opportunity enhances national security by supporting the creation and commercial viability of a defense-critical domestic biofuels industry to advance alternatives to petroleum. DPA is an authority that dates back to and has been used to boost industries such as steel, aluminum, titanium, semiconductors, beryllium, and radiation-hardened electronics.""DPA is a critical component of strengthening our national security, and energy is a national security issue,"" stated Secretary Mabus. ""Our reliance on foreign oil is a significant military vulnerability and it would be irresponsible not to address it. Pursuing a viable, domestic alternative is the best way to preserve the budget for operational necessities like training and shipbuilding, and this funding opportunity is an important step in accelerating an economically self-sufficient alternative fuels market.""The FOA comprises a two-phased approach, with government and industry sharing in the cost. In Phase 1, applicants will submit a design package and comprehensive business plan for a commercial-scale biorefinery, identify and secure project sites and take additional steps spelled out in the announcement. Awardees selected to continue into Phase 2 will submit additional information for the construction or retrofit of a biorefinery.Agencies participating in this initiative will make additional funding requests to Congress to support the initiative, including President Obama's budget request of $110 million.""This is an important time for the biofuels industry to step up and show the Department of the Navy how they have developed biofuels that are certified and certifiable for military use,"" stated Secretary Vilsack. ""The ability for U.S. industry to make, create and innovate has never been more important to our national and energy security. I know that through this DPA effort the nation will be able to harvest an aviation biofuels industry to satisfy the world's needs, not just our U.S. military.""Investments in Biofuels Research, Development and Demonstration to Drive Cost Reductions, Technological BreakthroughsToday, the Energy Department is also announcing new investments in earlier stage biofuels research that complement the commercial-scale efforts announced today by the Navy and USDA. Totaling $32 million, these early-stage, pre-commercial investments are the latest steps in the Obama Administration's efforts to advance biofuels technologies to continue to bring down costs, improve performance, and identify new effective, non-food feedstocks and processing technologies.""Advanced biofuels are an important part of President Obama's all-of-the-above strategy to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and support American industries and American jobs,"" said Secretary Chu. ""By pursuing new processes and technologies for producing next-generation biofuels, we are working to accelerate innovation in a critical and growing sector that will help to improve U.S. energy security and protect our air and water.""The funding announced by DOE today includes $20 million to support innovative pilot-scale and demonstration-scale biorefineries that could produce renewable biofuels that meet military specifications for jet fuel and shipboard diesel using a variety of non-food biomass feedstocks, waste-based materials and algae. These projects may support new plant construction, retrofits on existing U.S. biorefineries or operation at plants ready to begin production at the pilot- or pre-commercial scale. This investment will also help federal and local governments, private developers and industry collect accurate on the cost of producing fuels made from biomass and waste feedstocks. The full funding solicitation is available HERE.In addition, the Energy Department also announced $12 million to support up to eight projects focused on researching ways to develop biobased transportation fuels and products using synthetic biological processing. Synthetic biological processing offers an innovative technique to enable efficient, cost-saving conversion of non-food biomass to biofuels. These projects will develop novel biological systems that can enhance the breakdown of raw biomass feedstocks and assist in converting feedstocks into transportation fuels.The projects will be led by small businesses, universities, national laboratories and industry and will seek to overcome various technical and scientific barriers to cost-competitive advanced biofuels and bioproducts. The full funding opportunity announcement is available HERE.The new investments announced today build on the steps the Energy Department is already taking to push the boundaries of biofuel technologies and move towards commercial-scale production at refineries across the country.

"USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 23,  Audrey Rowe, USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs, chats with the Shenandoah Valley Community Breastfeeding support group August 6 in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  I recently had the pleasure to spend a little time with some expecting and nursing mothers in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  It was the first meeting of a newly formed community breastfeeding support group planned to coincide with World Breastfeeding Week.  My friend Mitch Greenbaum, Director of Shenandoah Valley WIC and Nutrition Services, and his team of trained WIC nutritionists, board-certified lactation consultants and breastfeeding peer counselors, hosted nearly two dozen pregnant and nursing mothers to talk about how important breastfeeding is for both mother and child and how to have a satisfying and healthy breastfeeding experience. The women shared stories and got answers to questions new mothers often ask such as: “Does it hurt?”  “What should I do when I’m out in public and need to feed my baby?”  And, “How can I keep feeding my baby after I return to work?”  I shared my personal experiences too; knowing the trepidation and uncertainty a nursing mother experiences.  But Mitch’s team of experts calmed the fear and helped the women feel comfortable about the choice to breastfeed.  The messages helped the women understand how to cope with a busy schedule and perhaps a job, how to involve family and friends, and most importantly, helped the women understand just how nutritionally important breast milk is. Research proves that feeding human milk to young children and the practice of breastfeeding improves the health, immune system, and the development of children. It protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), ear infections, upper and lower respiratory infections, allergies, intestinal disorders, colds and viruses.  Breastfeeding also protects mothers against osteoporosis and breast and ovarian cancer.  These nutritional benefits, both for children and for women, last long after breastfeeding has ended. I applaud local WIC and Nutrition Service programs like the one in Shenandoah Valley for their efforts to promote and encourage this vital part of human development.  Through innovative community support groups and local community partnerships; through health provider outreach and public awareness; and through on-line USDA resources such as Loving Support and WIC Works, women, families, and whole communities are more aware of the profound benefits of breastfeeding.

"Administradora del Servicio de Alimentos y Nutrición del USDA in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 11,  Nutricionistas del WIC discuten opciones de alimentos saludables con participantes y niños  Los programas de nutrición del USDA (por siglas en inglés) proveen acceso a una dieta saludable a millones de americanos elegibles para las ayudas cada mes. Ya sea en escuelas, centros comunitarios o en casas de todo el país, estos programas trabajan en conjunto como una red de seguridad nutritiva para asegurar que ningún americano que cualifique pase hambre. Considero que la nutrición suplementar para mujeres, infantes y niños, mejor conocida como WIC (por sus siglas en inglés)  es un programa especial. Dicho programa provee alimentos suplementarios a los más vulnerables—infantes, embarazadas, mujeres lactando y luego del parto y a niños hasta la edad de 5 años que enfrentan un riesgo nutricional. WIC también provee referencias para atención médica y social, y para educación nutritiva, incluyendo la promoción y el soporte a la lactancia materna. Un nuevo reporte del USDA del programa y características de WIC (disponible en ingles) confirma el éxito de estos esfuerzos. Por ejemplo, al revisar la información recopilada se registró un aumento del 4 por ciento en dos años en la participación de madres del programa WIC que lactan sus niños con leche materna. De las agencias estatales que reportaron madres que lactaron a sus hijos en el , se reportó que 67 por ciento de los infantes entre los 6 y 13 meses estaban siendo amamantados o lo estuvieron durante un tiempo en comparación con un 63 por ciento registrado en un estudio anterior que se realizo en el . Es más, la lactancia materna entre participantes de WIC ha estado en continuo aumento desde , y este año por primera vez, el porcentaje de mamas lactantes fue mayor que el número de nuevas madres no lactantes. Los hallazgos son una buena noticia, ya que la lactancia materna es el método ideal de alimentación para infantes, ya que provee beneficios para la mama y el niño. Las ayudas del programa WIC están llegando a madres y niños de escasos recursos. Cerca de tres cuartas partes de los 9 millones de participantes en WIC que reportaron sus ingresos se encuentran por debajo de lo que se considera como pobreza, a comparación del 15 por ciento entre la población general de los Estados Unidos. La mayoría de los que reciben las ayudas de WIC tienen menos de 5 años y más de la mitad de los participantes eran menores de 3 años. Entre otras buenas noticias es importante señalar que la obesidad infantil ha disminuido entre los participantes de WIC(disponible en ingles). En el , el 15.3 por ciento de los niños en WIC de un año confrontaban problemas de obesidad comparado con los hallazgos registrados el 16.8 por ciento en el . De manera similar, en el se reportó que 14.7 por ciento de los niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 experimentaba obesidad mientras que en el la cantidad disminuyo a 14.0 por ciento. El centro para el control de enfermedades profundizo en el estudio usando datos del WIC de 43 estados y territorios de niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 años. Descubrieron que al revés de la tendencia anterior, en 19 de los estados/territorios hubo  reducciones significativas y que 21 de ellos no reportaron problemas de obesidad infantil, con solo 3 mostrando aumentos. WIC ayuda a trazar el futuro de nuestro país de una manera vital al proveer a madres e hijos la nutrición que necesitan para tener embarazos exitosos y en el caso de los niños, un crecimiento saludable. De hecho, investigaciones anteriores han demostrado que las ayudas que ofrece WIC ejercen un papel importante en embarazos ya que ayudan a evitar complicaciones como fiebre, embarazos prematuros o incluso las costosas tarifas de los cuidados de salud. Este es un programa que no solo está proporcionando nutrición a familias de bajos ingresos, pero también reduciendo la mortalidad infantil y en verdad creando una generación futura más saludable.

"Racing for alternatives in the age of antibiotic resistance  “This week is World Antibiotic Awareness week and ‘Get Smart About Antibiotics’ week. Learn more about how USDA works to ensure antibiotics remain effective to treat both people and animals when necessary and the alternatives available to traditional antibiotics.” For billions of years, microbes such as bacteria and viruses have been in a struggle for survival in the face of naturally occurring antimicrobial substances. This struggle has continued in nature and into human society, where humans, plants, animals, and microbes themselves constantly ward off disease-causing microbes. The plight for adaptation and survival is not unlike the Red Queen’s race in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass, where it takes all of the running one can do to remain in the same place.   Dr. Stephanie Pearl, Science Communicator, USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture  Posted in  Research and Science  Nov 18,   Respond to this story",What are some alternatives being explored by the USDA to traditional antibiotics in order to maintain their effectiveness for both human and animal treatments?,"The USDA is exploring alternatives to traditional antibiotics, including microbes that naturally ward off disease-causing microbes."
"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 02,  Incorporating local produce into summer meals programs benefits the entire community. Fields of asparagus and peas are in full bounty, soon to make way for sweet, juicy strawberries; towering stalks of corn; and more tomatoes than you’d ever know what to do with!  In many parts of the country, as we approach summer, the warm weather means that local harvests are at their peak, and fresh fruits and vegetables abound.  That’s what makes summer the perfect time of year for incorporating local foods into your meals.  And according to the most recently released from the Farm to School Census , more than 1,000 school districts nationwide are doing just that:  They’re bringing the farm to summer! When school lets out for summer, there’s still a need to ensure the millions of children who receive free and reduced-price school meals during the school year have consistent access to healthy meals.  USDA’s summer meals programs help fill that gap, serving over 191 million meals to children last summer alone!  Community centers, libraries, day camps, churches, and more can all sign up to host a summer meals site through the summer meals programs, but schools make for a particularly good site since they already have food production facilities in place for serving meals throughout the school year.  The Farm to School Census found that more than one in five school districts that participate in farm to school programs report including local foods in meals served through their summer meals programs. Schools serving as summer meals sites often also offer fun, hands-on activities related to local foods that attract and engage kids in their programming.  Farm to summer activities include growing community gardens, taking a field trip to the farm, and conducting taste tests of local produce. But it’s not just the kids that are benefiting; incorporating local produce into the summer meals programs helps the entire community. Farm to summer arrangements can help increase participation for summer meals, provide a source of income for local growers and producers, and reinforce healthy habits promoted during the school year. To find out more about summer meals sites in your area, visit the Summer Site Finder.  Or to get involved yourself, consider becoming a site sponsor or helping raise awareness in your area.  To learn more about farm to summer and farm to school programs, check out the Community Food System’s webpage.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack in  USDA Results  Rural  Dec 17,   This week, at my request, USDA Rural Development and Farm Service Agency staff kicked off a series of meetings intended to gather ideas about ways to spark job creation and economic growth in rural America. This request is a direct result of the Forum on Jobs and Economic Growth that President Obama hosted at the White House earlier this month. Because of the importance of this effort, I have asked that these meetings be held in every state, and in territories including Guam and Puerto Rico. We intend to complete all of them by February 1 and provide meeting directly to the White House.  Rural Development State Directors along with Farm Service Agency State Executive Directors, are the hosts and those invited to participate include business owners, members of the community, state and local officials, union representatives, non-profit service providers and economists.  The objective is clear:  discuss steps that can be taken to make the economy grow and put Americans back to work. All of these meetings are public events and anyone with an interest in boosting the economy is welcome to attend. Each State and Executive Director will prepare a report on the meeting in their state and the will be provided to the White House. As I travel across the country, I continue to meet Americans who face great challenges.  It’s important to not only find a way to provide them with opportunities, it is necessary to restore their hope.  President Obama believes in nurturing strong, robust, and vibrant rural communities, but the best way to do that is to find a way to provide those living in rural towns with meaningful, financially rewarding jobs. As a former governor and mayor I know how important this effort is. I hope you’ll participate. To learn more, go to the Rural Development Job Roundtables Schedule and the News Release “USDA to Host Roundtables on Jobs, Economic Growth.” More meetings are being scheduled so if you don’t see your state listed, check back or contact your State Rural Development or FSA office for more information.

"USDA One Health Joint Working Group Co-Chair and Deputy Administrator, Animal Production and Protection, USDA Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Nov 18,  ARS scientists identifying bacterial pathogens in the lab. Photo by Peggy Greb. Antibiotics are lifesavers. We depend on them to treat bacterial infections and diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis and strep throat, as well as ear infections and infected wounds. In response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, veterinarians and producers are moving toward more judicious antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe. This is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics. The USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing new technologies to address antibiotic resistance and reduce the use of antibiotics through agricultural management, which includes food, animals, crops and the environment—water, soil and climate. This research falls into USDA’s One Health approach when mitigating the problems associated with antibiotic resistance.  One Health is the concept that the health of animals, the health of people, and the viability of ecosystems are intricately linked. A One Health approach embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. With its partners, USDA’s objective through this multidisciplinary approach is to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society. USDA has gained in-depth knowledge about antimicrobial resistance through its work on the agricultural environment, animal health and food safety. Over the years, scientists have developed and patented new technologies that could help reduce the use of antibiotics. Discoveries include using natural supplements like vitamin D to treat a condition of dairy cows called “mastitis,” which affects milk quality and production of cattle. Vitamin D, as well as yeast, also has the potential to treat turkey diseases. In addition, scientists have shown that non-antibiotic methods, such as essential oils in citrus, reduce foodborne pathogens found in the gut of animals; that phytochemicals—natural chemicals found in such plants as safflower, plums and peppers—enhance the immune system of chickens; and that certain natural compounds kill foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7. Other research breakthroughs include creating new, effective antimicrobials and vaccines to fight such pathogens as Salmonella and Campylobacter to lower their incidence in chickens and turkeys and help keep consumers healthy. Finding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply. ARS scientists are studying a variety of techniques to ensure our food supply remains safe. Photo by Peggy Greb.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Initiatives  May 14,   Many children believe their food comes from the grocery store. But a class of 23 Mississippi second-graders knows better than that – the delicious food they love starts with a seed. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People’s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary visited a new People’s Garden at an office of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and planted seeds of squash, watermelon, pumpkin, cucumber and, of course, the “Abraham Lincoln” tomato. Earth Team volunteers joined employees from NRCS’ Science and Technology Center to teach the youngsters about growing fruits and vegetables and the history of USDA. They learned of USDA’s upcoming 150th anniversary and its origins with President Lincoln. The People’s Garden effort started three years ago, and this central Mississippi garden is one of more than 1,500 People’s Gardens across the nation. The garden’s star plant is the “Abraham Lincoln” tomato, an heirloom variety first introduced in by the W.H. Buckbee seed company. Not only did they have a chance to get their hands dirty, but they had a party and sang “Happy Birthday” to USDA while enjoying a pumpkin cupcake. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People’s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. It would not be a party without conservation mascot Sammy Soil, who made a special appearance. Students also enjoyed meeting the garden’s guard – a scarecrow made from farmers’ clothes and recycled grocery bags. Nancy Magee, an NRCS program expert, organized the event and sees the plantings as a great way to connect students to the origin of food and explain the role farmers play in their lives. The garden is nearby Strawberry Park, a city green space with a busy walking trail. Magee said the garden’s location informs passersby about USDA and the People’s Garden. Plus, it is a beautiful asset to the office, she said. As children were boarding the school bus, after their visit to the new garden, she heard one student tell another, “I’m going to come back in a week and see how they’re growing.” That is exactly what Magee wanted to hear.

"Research Microbiologist, Agricultural Research Service, National Animal Disease Center in  Animals  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Nov 20,  ARS remains committed to conducting research to our overall understanding of antimicrobial resistance in swine pathogens. This week is World Antibiotic Awareness Week and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) remains committed to using a “One Health” approach in conducting research that will identify solutions to help prolong the usefulness of a very precious resource—antibiotics. For example, ARS research includes understanding how common production practices might impact antimicrobial resistance and understanding whether certain animal pathogens may be a public health concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one bacteria type that is a public health concern because of its resistance to some antibiotics which can make it difficult to treat. MRSA has been found in livestock – mainly in swine. One particular MRSA strain, called ST5, has raised additional public health concerns because it is a major cause of human infections globally. To address these public health concerns, ARS conducted research to determine whether production practices like using in-feed zinc as an antidiarrheal agent contribute to the emergence and spread of MRSA in U.S. swine populations, and if ST5 bacterial isolates from swine and from humans are genetically related. ARS demonstrated that applying zinc in feed does not play a role in the prevalence of livestock-associated MRSA ST5 in the U.S. swine population. More importantly, ARS found that ST5 isolates from agricultural sources are genetically distinct and separate from clinical MRSA ST5 isolates obtained from human clinical settings. Specifically, isolates from agricultural sources were found to be extremely similar to each other within farms and lacked genes typically carried by human isolates. Collectively, ARS indicate that livestock-associated MRSA and clinical MRSA ST5 isolates are genetically distinct and transmission and/or genetic exchange between them is not currently occurring based on the findings in this study. ARS researchers are continuing to build on these results to further determine the distribution and impact of livestock-associated-MRSA ST5 outside of the livestock setting. As we celebrate World Antibiotic Awareness Week, we remain committed to a “One-Health” approach to prevent, not just react to, complex public and animal health issues. The information gained from these studies is important to our overall understanding of animal pathogens, and any potential risks to public health.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 17,  According to the World Wildlife Fund, the American Pika (Ochotona princeps) could be the first mammal victim of climate change (US Forest Service Photo). In Scanning the Conservation Horizon, a report published by the National Wildlife Federation, with support from the U.S. Forest Service and other partners, scientists describe climate change as an increasing threat to species and ecosystems.  Addressing this threat requires the right answers, which can only come from asking the right questions. Through extensive research, U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists have developed a 22-question measurement tool called a System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species.  The tool will help land managers gauge the impact of climate change on land animals and make decisions about protecting threatened species.  Questions evaluate projected changes to animal habitats, physical functions, major life cycle events and interactions with other animal species, and their potential to cope with those changes. Users must chose from three answers associated with each question, which will identify traits and issues related to animal vulnerabilities. One question, for example, asks, “Are specific habitat components for breeding expected to change within the associated vegetation type?”  To determine vulnerability, users of the tool must answer if the breeding habitat components are expected to increase, decrease or be unchanged. Assuming climate change projections are correct, users then will note whether the information available is “adequate” or “inadequate” to assign a score for each question.  If the information is sufficient, an overall score will be assigned, representing the species’ relative vulnerability to climate change. The tool focuses solely on the effects of climate change on land animals. Scores can be used to rank at-risk animal species and identify vulnerability “hot spots” within large landscapes, such as national forests. “This tool doesn’t provide a definitive answer about the extent climate change will affect animal species,” said Deborah Finch, program manager of the Grassland, Shrubland and Desert Ecosystems Science unit of the Rocky Mountain Research Station, “but information is power, and we’re empowering land managers to start assessing vulnerabilities and making decisions about where to direct their limited resources.” Finch, along with Megan Friggens and Karen Bagne, both Rocky Mountain Research Station researchers, developed the questions. They say that users should rely on information gathered from published materials, expert consultation and personal knowledge to complete the questionnaire.

A walk through the facility is enough to convince anyone that Weld County School District 6 is committed to scratch-cooked, locally-grown food for its 22,000 students at 35 schools.  In this rural Colorado school district, where over 40 languages are spoken at home and 66 percent of students are eligible for free or reduced price meals, fresh, tasty food is the norm – even down to the green chili, a southwestern favorite roasted in-house, using three varieties of local peppers. About a quarter of the central kitchen is dedicated to processing fresh fruits and vegetables.  Mushrooms are sliced, carrots are shredded and onions are diced. With funding from a USDA Farm to School Grant in , this food hub portion of the kitchen was furnished with tables, wash stations and equipment to process local food for Weld County’s own meals and for other districts in the area. Locally-grown acorn squash and onions stored in the central kitchen for a harvest lunch in November Natalie Leffler is the Food Hub Manager at Weld County School District 6. Her job is to coordinate partnerships with farmers, ranchers and local businesses to source as much local food as possible, defined as grown or produced within a 400 mile radius. Leffler manages an annual procurement to establish relationships and contracts. Growers must submit a food safety checklist with their bid documents, which she confirms with an in-person site visit, so the district can rest-assured that the local products are safe.  Matt Poling, the school district’s Executive Chef, ensures that menu planning, recipe development and production processes maximize the use of local products. The freezer is full of shredded local zucchini (for blending into tomato sauce), mirepoix (the age-old combination of onion, celery, and carrots used as a base for soups) and other local ingredients to incorporate into meals in the off-season.  The team even prepares mashed potatoes made with local red potatoes and home-made gravy. Locally-grown and dried pinto beans are sorted and cooked into refried beans or chili.  Just outside the facility are four giant compost bins designed to turn food scraps from the kitchen into compost for the district’s school gardens, funded through an innovative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District.  Sometimes El Fuego, the district’s flashy food truck, is parked outside, too. But typically the truck is out roaming the district, serving up favorites like barbacoa street tacos and yakisoba noodle bowls to students and school staff. Four compost bins, funded through a creative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District, turn food scraps from the central kitchen into compost for school gardens The district goes beyond buying local food – school gardens, student wellness and food education are three major areas of focus. Plans are underway to transform a sandy, unused portion of a nearby schoolyard into an educational farm focused on student engagement and employment.  Called “Growing Grounds,” the project vision includes raised beds, an orchard, a teaching kitchen, hoop houses and a greenhouse. Inspired by Weld County School District 6 and their innovative farm to school programs?  USDA is currently accepting applications for the Farm to School Grant Program, which assists eligible entities in implementing farm to school programs that improve access to local foods in eligible schools. Consider applying for a grant to bring more local food into school meals, promote healthy eating habits and expand markets for American farmers and producers.

USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) grants are helping farmers markets implement creative programs to support local food producers and build healthy communities. Photo courtesy Mr T in DC. Nutritional classes, purple beets, basil pesto and dark roast coffee - it’s not your father’s farmers market.  The entire local food system is maturing and farmers markets are offering more and more community-focused services. Many farmers markets now give their customers a chance to learn about locally-produced foods, in addition to buying and consuming them. USDA is a proud partner and supporter of local and regional food systems through our programs, grants and technical services. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) grants are helping farmers markets implement creative programs to support local food producers and build healthy communities. One example of an AMS grant success story is Community Foodworks, which manages the Columbia Heights Farmers Market and six other markets across Washington, DC, and Northern Virginia. Leveraging a Farmers Market Promotion Program grant, Foodworks established a new Wednesday evening farmers market to increase access to locally produced food in the Columbia Heights neighborhood. The program included “Bonus Bucks” to give shoppers who use Federal food benefits (SNAP, WIC, Senior FMNP) more purchasing power. The grant also helped Foodworks to develop a mixed-income CSA program – a weekly share from the market’s producers with options for individual or family-sized shares or a subsidized family-sized share for SNAP customers. The new market had a real impact on the community: Over half of the customers reported eating more vegetables since the market opened  A majority of market visitors reported the Bonus Bucks program was the main reason they shopped at the market  Most customers agreed that spending their benefits at the market was easy  In addition to their farmers market efforts, Foodworks offers other creative programs to help support the community.  In partnership with another local social service organization, Foodworks is able to provide fresh, local food home delivery services for seniors. They serve as a site for USDA summer meals, distributing 3-4 dozen snacks to hungry children at their two weekday markets. They also offer community educational classes on nutrition, obesity, and diabetes intervention. In the fall of , Foodworks piloted a new Veterans Vegetable Prescription Program to distribute weekly fruit and vegetable vouchers to eligible Veterans, seeing a redemption rate of 42 percent. These are great innovations and partnerships leveraged by Foodworks.  As we continue to support the marketing and distribution of locally produced foods for U.S. farmers and ranchers, we look to see more impacts resulting from our investments.  Under this Administration, USDA has invested more than $1 billion in over 40,000 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects. These activities contribute to USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2) initiative, which coordinates efforts across USDA. Our recently-revamped website provides USDA resources for every point in the local food supply chain, including grants, loans, and other instructional guides.  Additionally, the KYF2 Compass maps local and regional food system investments across the country. More information on how USDA investments are connecting producers with consumers and expanding rural economic opportunities is available in Chapter IV of USDA Results on Medium. “The growth of Community Foodworks and our essential programs couldn't be possible without opportunities like the Farmers Market Promotion Program from AMS,” said Nick Stavely, Community Foodworks Farmers Market & Incentives Program Manager. “We're thankful for the role that the AMS grants played in the organization's expansion and program development.” Photo of Columbia Heights Farmers Market courtesy Mr T in DC.

"Forest Service Research & Development in  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 03,  Kellie Carim, eDNA coordinator for the Genomics Center, collects and processes samples. (Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research profile. The U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. The Forest Service’s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station’s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.  collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management. Imagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. “eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

"Research and Development, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 01,  Cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). (Emily Harrington/E.H. Illustration) U.S. Forest Service scientists at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Missoula, Mont., have identified a new species of fish—the cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). Although thousands of new species are described by scientists each year, only a small percentage of them are animal species, and even fewer are found in the United States, underscoring the importance of this discovery. Freshwater sculpins, with their characteristic large heads and fins, are bottom dwellers that can be found in cold, fast-moving streams throughout North America. Biologists have long suspected that there were undescribed species of sculpins in the Upper Columbia River Basin, but lacked the tools to recognize them. Cedar sculpin populations were previously thought to be shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus), an understandable misidentification given that sculpins are notoriously difficult to identify based on their physical features. “Through our collaboration with the University of Montana, we uncovered morphological and genetic evidence demonstrating that two species have been masquerading under a single name for over 50 years,” said Michael Young, a Forest Service research fisheries biologist. The new species of sculpin was discovered in the Coeur d’Alene and St. Joe River basins in Idaho and part of the Clark Fork River Basin in Montana. In naming the species, the scientists consulted with elders of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, whose historical homeland overlaps with the current range of this fish.  The scientific name for the species, Cottus schitsuumsh, is derived from the name for the Tribe, Schitsu’umsh, which means “those who were found here.” The common name refers to the western redcedar, a tree often found along streams in this region. While not commercially valuable in and of themselves, sculpins are well-known to anglers as a food source for big trout—a famous fly pattern, the muddler minnow, is designed to resemble a sculpin—and as indicators of water quality. The cedar sculpin is abundant in tributaries that also support westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. Forest Service scientists and their partners believe that much hidden diversity remains among sculpin populations throughout the Western U.S., with additional species waiting to be identified. They are dedicated to helping unravel these mysteries in order to conserve and sustainably manage our natural resources. Top, side and bottom view of a male cedar sculpin.

"Tree Rings Tell the History of Fire and Forest Health  Why are Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists sampling tree rings in the Pinaleño Mountains of southeast Arizona? Because tree ring samples reveal the history of fire. When fire scorches a tree, the tree floods its wound with sap, which protects the wound from wood rot decay for hundreds of years, as long as fires keep burning at a low intensity.  Diane Banegas, Research and Development, USDA Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Apr 12,   Respond to this story",What role do tree rings play in recording the history of fire events in the Pinaleño Mountains?,Tree rings record the history of fire events by preserving information about when fires occurred and burned at low intensities.
"After the Fire - Wood Waste Put to Work  Biochar, or wood waste, is a porous carbon substance that results from burning wood in the absence of oxygen.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Nov 18,  NRCS provided technical assistance to the Choctaws in the creation of Lake Pushmataha, a 285-acre lake in Neshoba County. November is American Indian Heritage Month and offers a great time to recognize the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for their stellar record as stewards of the environment. The tribe knows the value of land. That’s why it is working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to improve wildlife habitat in its communities across the state. The Choctaws have used NRCS’ Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) to improve 860 acres in Carroll County on their property Malmasion this year. Malmasion is the site of a plantation that was built among Choctaw hunting grounds. The plantation burned in the s, and the Choctaws purchased the land in . The tribe, through its director of natural resources, Jason Grisham, is implementing wildlife conservation practices that enhance and restore habitat for wildlife. While habitat has improved for deer, this land also provides refuge for other native animals, including turkeys, squirrels and songbirds. Since the tribe started working with NRCS, oak trees are dropping ample acorns, a favorite food of deer and other wildlife. Tribal members are also taking down bigger bucks—many with traditional bows. A big part of wildlife management is the use of prescribed burning for habitat diversity. This practice is not only used by NRCS conservationists, but is also a method the Choctaws have used for hundreds of years and are currently using to enhance this land. Forest management is a big part of Jason Grisham’s (right) duties. Choctaws use the firewood for heat during the winter, but the bulk of it is used during funeral services, where a perpetual fire must be maintained for three days. NRCS tribal liaison Tim Oakes has worked with the tribe’s forestry department on managing the forests, providing technical assistance on thinning. As the habitat matures, the Choctaws cut trees to provide firewood. It is tribal custom to use firewood during funeral services, where a fire is kept burning for three days. The Choctaws are able to meet the demand through proper forest management. NRCS has also teamed up with the Choctaws in an educational project called “Wetland Discovery.” This 600-foot boardwalk meanders through a wetland constructed with WHIP funds. The elevated walkway has signs in written in English and Choctaw describing the native species of plants and animals. Grisham said Tribal leaders have recognized the benefits of working with NRCS in recent years, and that future partnerships are on the horizon. The Choctaws use this area to hold cultural education events to teach children about their traditions and history.

"Posted by Fátima Terry, Deputy Director, USDA Digital Service in  Technology  Aug 12,  The seeds of digital transformation are taking root as application reviews for our agency’s first Digital Service (DS) Fellows cohort are in progress. By establishing a dedicated fellow team at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), we will be able to improve access to USDA resources and programs across the country. Once onboarded this fall, our USDA Digital Service (DS) Fellows will work to accelerate the design, development, and delivery of customer-centric services. To gain insight on digital service best practices, we hosted the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) team at our headquarters in Washington, D.C. last month. Digital Service staff from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and other agencies shared their experience with USDS, how they are addressing current challenges, and what the future of digital services at their agencies looks like. “We are so appreciative of the great collaboration and partnership with USDS as we work to shape a Digital Service team here at USDA, and we learned a lot about how we can continue to drive this great work here across the many mission areas and missions of USDA,” said Arianne Gallagher-Welcher, Executive Director of the USDA Digital Service and Co-Founder of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program. USDA has seen firsthand the difference digital service can make. As the People’s Department, one of our most important missions is ensuring access to nutritious and safe food. Many of our nation’s youngest children were affected when a manufacturer product recall and weakened supply chains caused an infant formula shortage in . This particularly impacted USDA customers, as families who use our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) buy 56% of all the formula sold in America. With other federal partners, USDA teamed up with the USDS to develop and analyze real-time about the amount of formula available in any given U.S. location. As a result, 388 million bottles of infant formula were imported and deployed to the places that needed it most based on new and analytics. This is just one example of how digital service can deliver solutions for the federal government’s most challenging technology implementation problems. You can learn more about this and other USDS solutions in their Impact Report. Our collaborative partnership with USDS is essential as our new Digital Service team launches. Together, we will build a stronger technology organization at USDA than can more efficiently support our employees and customers in the future.

"Acting National Coordinator for USDA Climate Hubs, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy in  Climate  Farming  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 08,  In June , Secretary Vilsack outlined a vision for agricultural solutions to environmental challenges, which included creating the Regional Climate Hubs. In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests. Early career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. “Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said. “Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Midwest Regional Office with guest author Olivia Rodriguez, Outreach and Communications Manager, Top Box Foods in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 07,  Top Box Foods is not a grocery store, farmers market, or food bank. Top Box Foods is a community-driven non-profit, founded in Chicago in , that creates access to healthy and affordable food for the communities they serve. Customers place orders online or via phone for nutritious food which is offered at prices up to 40% lower than grocery stores. Prior to March , Top Box Foods shoppers would pick up their orders at community distribution sites such as churches. However, when the pandemic hit, Top Box Foods replaced the pick-up model with their free home delivery program. Top Box Foods accepts SNAP benefits as payment for orders, making it an essential resource for households looking to make the most of their SNAP dollars to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins and more. “When I was a kid, I could walk to the grocery store. One of the things I remember the most is that I was always inundated with the different smells of fruits and vegetables. You don’t get that anymore. The deli across the alley doesn’t have fruits or vegetables, and the nearest grocery store closed,” explained Top Box Foods customer Cassandra while receiving a delivery at her home in the summer of . Cassandra, a Top Box Foods shopper since , previously picked up her boxes at her local church, but leg injuries made getting to and from home with a load of groceries difficult. “I was praying for home delivery, and these deliveries help me out a lot. I get all my produce from Top Box,” she shared. In order to provide nutritious food for all, we need to think creatively and work with one another – just like Top Box Foods did when they started delivering groceries right to Cassandra’s door. The work of Top Box Foods aligns with pillar 1 of the national strategy by improving food access and affordability in support of the Biden-Harris Administration’s vision of a country where no one wonders whether they will have enough money to put food on the table, and where the healthy food choice is the easier choice.

"Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service’s Livestock and Poultry Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 15,  USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Purdue University have developed a series of training videos that illustrate proper sanitation assessment techniques to evaluate shell egg processing equipment. While the practices in these videos are in facilities that have USDA grading, they are valuable for any shell egg facility wishing to learn more about good sanitation techniques. To support emerging needs across the egg industry in recent years, AMS reviewed its internal procedures to assess equipment sanitation in shell egg processing plants. The agency visited over 30 shell egg processing facilities across the country to assess equipment sanitation and consistency. In order to document and share findings, AMS partnered with Purdue and ARS to develop this educational video series. The videos take the viewer through each phase of shell egg processing and explain how to inspect each component of the facility for sanitation effectiveness. The 18 videos are a great resource for shell egg processing facilities by illustrating what clean machines and facilities should look like prior to daily verification by USDA grading personnel. Originally released in English, these videos have now been translated into Spanish due to industry demand. The full series of videos can be found on Purdue University Extension’s YouTube channel at: Egg Processing & Production Videos - YouTube.

"USDA Food Loss and Waste Liaison in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Jun 15,  In the United States, more than one-third of all available food goes uneaten through loss or waste and when landfilled it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. On May 26, , the U.S. Department of Agriculture hosted our first ever USDA Food Loss and Waste Innovation Fair. This free, virtual fair highlighted businesses that are creating or implementing state-of-the-art technical solutions to reduce food loss and waste throughout the food system – from farm to table – and highlighted USDA activities in this space. Three categories of booth holders showcased their food loss and waste activities, products, and innovations. First, the fair highlighted U.S. Food Loss and Waste Champions. In addition to reducing food waste in their operations, several of these food industry leaders — e.g., Sprouts Farmers Market, Sodexo, and MGM Resorts International — committed to fighting hunger by donating safe, excess food to charitable organizations. Secondly, the fair also gave a platform for USDA agencies to share their work on food loss and waste (e.g., research, funding, measurement, outreach). As one example, the joint booth by USDA Foreign Agriculture Service and Feed the Future has information on the U.S. Government’s initiative to simultaneously combat global hunger and food loss and waste. Third, the fair featured USDA-funded organizations that are developing or marketing food loss and waste reducing technologies. Among the innovations was Full Cycle Bioplastics’ patented technology, which makes a compostable bioplastic from organic waste that can help address three global problems at once — reducing food waste, climate change, and plastic pollution. Nearly 850 people attended the live event. Most of the USDA Food Loss and Waste Innovation Fair and materials will be available for a full year so feel free to register today, visit the booths, and download materials on demand.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety Education Staff in  Health and Safety  Jul 01,  This Fourth of July, join the revolution against foodborne illness. Summer’s rising temperatures make picnics a playground for bacteria as families prepare, cook, and eat food outside. Here are some tips to keep you safe: Pledge Allegiance to Cleanliness Wash your hands before and after you handle food:  Wet your hands with clean, running water, turn off the tap and apply soap.  Lather your hands by rubbing them together with soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.  Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds.  Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.  Dry your hands using a clean towel. Don’t have access to a faucet? Carry bottled water, soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer or disposable moist towelettes that contain at least 60 percent alcohol. Use Red, White and Blue Cutting Boards Avoid cross contamination by using separate, different colored cutting boards — one for fresh fruits and vegetables, one for cheeses, and another for raw meats. Spark Up that Grill If you’re grilling at your picnic, remember to cook raw meat and poultry to a safe minimum internal temperature: ground meats at 160 F, whole cuts of meat at 145 F with a three-minute rest time, and poultry at 165 F. Land of the Free-zer Pack coolers with bags of ice, gel packs or even frozen water bottles to store your food. Use an appliance thermometer in your cooler to monitor that your food stays chilled at 40 F or below. For more information about food safety, contact the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline to talk to a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

"University of Georgia, Associate Professor in  Research and Science  Dec 09,  Carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation sector constitute 2.5 percent of global emissions. One way to reduce this carbon footprint is to replace conventional aviation fuel (obtained by refining crude oil) with aviation fuel derived from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks. Carinata (Brassica Carinata), also known as Ethiopian mustard, is an oilseed crop that can be grown across the southern U.S. during winter months. The oil obtained from crushed carinata seeds can be refined to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This could reduce up to 68 percent of carbon emissions compared to a unit of conventional aviation fuel in the U.S. based on the findings of a USDA-National Institute of Fooda and Agriculture funded study recently published in the journal Global Change Biology Bioenergy by Dr. Puneet Dwivedi, Asiful Alam and Farhad Masum. Carinata does not compete with traditional summer crops grown in the region and could potentially provide additional income opportunities to farmers. It improves water quality, prevents soil erosion, and supports soil health. Since it is a non-food crop, carinata-based SAF also avoids the food-versus-fuel debate. The residues after crushing carinata are high in protein and can be used as animal feed. Refining carinata oil produces other valuable bioproducts such as renewable diesel and naphtha. Currently, producing carinata-based SAF costs more than conventional aviation fuel. As part of coordinated efforts to advance sustainable avial fuel, the Biden Administration proposed tax credits for SAF production meet 100 percent of aviation fuel demand by . This incentive could potentially attract investors to establish the necessary supply chain for carinata-based SAF in the southern United States, which could drive demand for the crop and inspire farmers to grow carinata in the region.

"Strategic Communications Coordinator, FPAC Business Center in  Conservation  Jan 05,  USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides extensive on the Nation’s conservation program activities through its RCA Viewer. And now, visualizations have been added to the tool, making the easier to interpret, sort, and download. Users can now graph, map, and download customized datasets that include information on acres receiving conservation, practices applied, land use, cropland soil erosion, and prime farmland. The tool also links to the full set of standard (tabular) RCA , which will continue to be available. Users can also link to research on the effect of conservation practices, including those from the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP), a multi-agency effort to quantify the environmental effects of conservation practices and programs and show the results of our conservation dollars spent. The RCA Viewer is named after the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act (RCA) of that gives the USDA the authority, among other things, to appraise the status and trends of soil, water, and related resources on non-Federal land. Other recent updates include on practice enhancements and bundles supported by the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and soil health performance measures. Two cropland soil health performance measures were added. The Cropland Soil Health and Sustainability measure identifies land units where at least two practices are applied to improve soil health during a single year. Practices include crop rotation, no-till, reduced till, cover crops, and CSP enhancements and bundles. The Cropland Soil Health Management System measure identifies areas where a group of conservation practices and enhancements (or bundles) are applied that address four basic soil health principles: minimize disturbance, maximize soil cover, maximize biodiversity, and maximize the presence of living roots. These updates, and now the addition of visualizations, show how NRCS is continually striving to improve the RCA Viewer to make it more valuable and easier to use.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service with guest author Alynn Sampson, Vice President, Operations & Impact, Food Bank of Lincoln in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Nutrition Security  Feb 08,  The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP, Reach and Resiliency – Round 1 grants are making an impact in communities across the nation. At the Food Bank of Lincoln, we have been able to leverage Reach and Resiliency sub-grant funding awarded by our Nebraska TEFAP agency to identify underserved areas and to implement strategies to increase TEFAP access in those areas. In some cases, the strategies were as simple as increasing the frequency of deliveries to specific communities to ensure that existing TEFAP resources were being equitably distributed. During the first quarter of the grant, we implemented a 21% increase in deliveries to four identified underserved counties, which resulted in a 55% increase in TEFAP pounds of food distributed to those areas when compared to the previous year. As a result, TEFAP is now reaching more than 4,000 households in Butler, Fillmore, Otoe, and York counties. We also now have 12 food access points in those counties and three additional non-profit partners involved in TEFAP operations. A recent pantry partner gave their input regarding food access: “As food prices continue to rise, having the ability for increased deliveries to both of my rural food pantries is critical. The number of food pantry clients has doubled in the past few months, and I expect a steady increase. It is very difficult for clients to receive fresh produce in rural areas, and that is something that is always in need. To buy one head of lettuce now is almost $5 at our rural grocery stores, and 99% of our clients cannot afford something as simple as a head of lettuce with the price increases.” The TEFAP Reach and Resiliency Grant has provided support to the Food Bank of Lincoln as they deliver USDA TEFAP products more broadly to our neighbors in need. The grant has also expanded the use of to identify convenient delivery areas as well as ensure an increased focus on consistent access to USDA TEFAP products for communities. We are well on our way to closing this inequity gap in our targeted four counties. States are encouraged to apply for TEFAP Round 2 grant funding at TEFAP Reach and Resiliency | Food and Nutrition Service (usda.gov).

"USDA-FSIS in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Feb 07,  The Super Bowl is the biggest and most anticipated sporting event of the year. Friends and families “huddle” and consume foods and snacks for the duration of the game while cheering for their favorite team. This iconic annual event is often celebrated by ordering takeout and delivered foods, which if left out too long, can cause foodborne illness. Leaving food out at room temperature is a big food safety penalty. Bacteria that can cause foodborne illness will start to grow to dangerous levels in the range of temperatures between 40 F and 140 F when left out for over two hours or one hour if above 90 F. This range of temperatures is called the Danger Zone. To avoid foodborne illness during the big game, follow this game plan:  Keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot. Cold foods should be kept under 40 F on the buffet table by nesting serving dishes of food in bowls of ice. Hot foods should be kept above 140 F. A preheated oven, chafing dishes, preheated warming trays or slow cookers can be used to keep food hot.  Don’t serve all food at once. Use small platters and replace them often with fresh refrigerated platters of food, rather than adding fresh food to a serving dish already on the table. Hot foods should be reheated to 165 F as measured with a food thermometer. When reheating in the microwave, cover the food for even heating. Check the temperature of the food in several places with a food thermometer, as some microwaved foods can have cold spots. For more information, call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline or email MPHotline@usda.gov to reach a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

"Posted by Farm to School Specialist Allison Bell, Mountain Plains Regional Office, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  May 31,  Bringing together local producers and schools was the objective of the “Bringing the Farm to School” producer training in Hardin, Montana. The training sought to build relationships between schools and producers to increase the availability of local foods served to children. USDA Farm to School Specialists Andrea Alma and Alli Bell were on hand to demonstrate the many ways USDA’s Farm to School Program is connecting with schools and communities. Partners from Montana Team Nutrition and the Mission Mountain Food Enterprise Center brought the training curriculum to life, showing agricultural producers how to approach schools to sell their products and offering insight into procurement considerations, including the budgets, timing, and regulations faced by school food directors. Participants shared ideas on how to connect kids to more local foods. For example, two local ranchers drove more than five hours to the training, looking for strategies on approaching schools with their excess ground beef. Another attendee, trying to start a food hub, wanted to orient her business to sell food to schools. Another participant planned to start a mixed vegetable operation and wanted to incorporate farm to school in her business plan. The training included a tour of the Hardin School kitchen with Food Service Director Marlo Spreng and Hardin Farm to School Coordinator Elle Ross. They described the district’s journey to more scratch cooking and meals featuring traditional Crow dishes, since the school serves children from the Crow Reservation. The training also hosted a “Montana Foods for Montana Schools” connection event for school food service professionals to learn more about Farm to School and to meet farmers in their area. This innovative event covered it all - knowledge sharing, relationship building, and coming together over a meal. It was an outstanding networking and program improvement opportunity Mountain Plains Regional staff were proud to attend.

"National Agricultural Library, Ming Chan, National Agricultural Library, and Cheryl Porter, University of Florida in  Research and Science  Sep 08,  Crop researchers are hungry for to feed their crop models. There is a wealth of historical that’s inaccessible because today’s crop model software applications cannot easily interpret it. USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) is working with the University of Florida and the Agricultural Research Network (ARDN) to solve this problem. ARDN is dedicated to making high value datasets from past research and experiments compatible with crop models and other analytical tools. With support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), NAL and the University of Florida are piloting a “hackathon” approach to make this old useful. Experts gather several times a year to create standardized vocabulary and extract relevant information to use in the AgMIP Crop Experiment schema (ACE) – a widely used format for agricultural models. As part of the NIFA grant, the team will annotate four datasets using ARDN protocols. The initial datasets include research from projects at Iowa State University, University of Georgia, the University of Arizona, and the Kellogg Biological Station. These annotated datasets will be available on NAL’s Ag Commons website. NAL also supports ARDN by hosting VMapper software on the Ag Commons website. VMapper creates a file which contains the “road map” for translating the original into the ACE format. ARDN’s collaborative efforts will save crop modelers time and give them access to much more historical , accelerating research and new discoveries.

"Public Affairs Specialist, FSIS, USDA in  Health and Safety  May 24,  At your next picnic, let the spotlight shine on your food — not on party crashers like Salmonella or Listeria. When temperatures rise and food safety steps aren’t followed, cold dishes at a cookout are at risk for unsafe bacteria levels. Avoid foodborne illness by following these steps: Clean: Remember to clean and sanitize all dishes and utensils used to make your salad and wash your hands before and after food prep. Separate: Use different cutting boards, plates and utensils to avoid spreading bacteria when preparing your raw foods and ready-to-eat cold dishes. Cook: Make sure the main meat or poultry ingredients used in cold salads (egg salad, chicken salad, etc.) are cooked to safe internal temperatures before mixing:  Cook eggs to 160 F.  Cook chicken to 165 F. Although most cold salads use mayonnaise, the danger of foodborne illness lies with the main ingredient, such as eggs or chicken. Make sure they are cooked and chilled at the proper temperature. If you use homemade mayonnaise, follow these . Chill: Avoid the Danger Zone (temperatures between 40 F and 140 F) by refrigerating perishable food within two hours — one hour if it’s a hot day (above 90 F). Keep cold foods at an internal temperature of 40 F or below by nestling food in ice or keeping food in a cooler.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center in  Conservation  Jun 23,  FWC Photo by Andy Wraithmell, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Did you know the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil scientists are playing an important role in saving Florida’s manatees? These giant, but gentle, creatures are adored by residents and visitors to Florida. Unfortunately, though, their numbers have been threatened in recent years throughout the state. Manatees in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon (IRL), which stretches 156 miles along Florida’s eastern coast, have been starving to death at an alarming rate over the last two years. These deaths can be attributed to a lack of seagrass, their main source of food, which is being affected by algal blooms. As the algae blooms destroy seagrass beds, it causes sediment to float to the water’s surface. The water goes from clear to murky, making it harder for light to penetrate the water and provide sustenance to the seagrass. This creates a vicious cycle where more seagrass dies, more sunlight is blocked, and the manatees are left with less food to eat. NRCS is part of a team working to address the challenge, along with St. Johns River Water Management District, the University of Florida, among many other national and state agencies. The scientists go out on the IRL in pontoon boats and use sonar to conduct underwater soil surveys to gather information on the healthiest areas and the most degraded areas of the lagoon. The information is used to decide where to concentrate restoration efforts. This information has helped improve lagoons through actions like clams, oysters, and seagrass being deployed to aid in filtering and clearing the water. Scientists hope that continued improvement will eventually lead to the full restoration of manatees in the IRL.

"Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Research and Science  Trade  Jun 10,  Several hundred non-native forest insect species have become established in the U.S. Recent arrivals, such as this adult Asian longhorned beetle, have killed millions of trees and altered urban landscapes in the Northeast and Midwest. (U.S. Department of Agriculture/Kenneth R. Law, courtesy of Bugwood.org)  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Wood makes great packaging material—it’s inexpensive, abundant and versatile—but there’s one drawback: destructive forest pests stowaway in the pallets, crates and dunnage (wood used to brace cargo) used in international shipping. Over many years, international trade has resulted in the inadvertent introduction of many non-native wood-feeding pests and plant pathogens in the U.S. and throughout the world. Some of these non-native insects, including the emerald ash borer and the Asian longhorned beetle, have become highly invasive and caused serious environmental and economic impacts. But an international standard for wood packaging material is slowing the inadvertent export of invasive bark- and wood-boring insects, according to a study conducted by Robert Haack, a research entomologist with the Forest Service’s Northern Research Station in Lansing, Mich., and a team of scientists. Researchers found as much as a 52 percent drop in infestation rates in the U.S., where the standard was implemented in three phases between and . The study was published May 14 in the journal PLOS ONE. The International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15, or ISPM 15, is a set of standards developed by the International Plant Protection Convention stipulating how wood packaging material used in international trade should be treated before export. Treatments for eliminating live insects that may be contained in wood include heating wood, fumigating it and requiring the removal of bark from wood used for wood packaging material. As of October , more than 78 countries had implemented ISPM 15. Haack and co-authors of the study, including U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists Kerry Britton (now retired), Joseph F. Cavey and Lynn J. Garrett, believe that the drop in infestation rates would be even more dramatic if more had been collected prior to implementation of the standard. The best available in the U.S. only allowed researchers to compare wood packaging infestation rates from two years prior to U.S. implementation of the new international standard to infestation rates during the first four years after the standards were implemented. “The reduction in infestation rate would likely have been even higher if we had more years of that predated U.S. implementation of these international standards,” Haack said. “For example, based on infestation of wood packaging material entering New Zealand from the early s, when infestation rates were higher, ISPM 15 has achieved closer to a 97 percent reduction in the number of insect stowaways.” International wood packaging material is now treated to prevent stowaways like this Asian longhorned beetle larvae.

U.S. agricultural exports continue to be a bright spot for America’s economy, worth a record $152.5 billion in fiscal year .  That’s why USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work so hard to keep these export markets open.  So in , when Morocco requested that USDA use a new dairy export certificate that we could not endorse, we launched into action.  Our goal was to protect an export market worth $126 million annually while preserving our close relationship with a valued trading partner. Morocco is the 13th largest export market for our dairy products, and U.S. dairy exports are the fastest growing export category to that country.  U.S. companies export many dairy commodities to Morocco, such as butter, cheese and skim milk powder, as well as dairy ingredients such as milk protein and whey protein products. However, in Morocco’s agricultural officials requested changes to the information provided on the dairy export certificates issued by the unit I direct, the Grading and Standards Division of within the AMS Dairy Program.  Most countries importing U.S. dairy products require these certificates, and issuing them is one of many services my Division provides to exporters to maintain and expand market access. As a stopgap measure, we began using a general dairy certificate to keep that market open.  But then, in April , following numerous detainments of U.S. dairy shipments, we learned that Morocco was considering stopping all U.S. dairy trade if we did not submit a specifically negotiated export certificate. Beginning in , the AMS Dairy Program worked closely with an existing interagency team of technical experts from AMS, USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address the issue.  The team submitted a response to Morocco that addressed additives, animal health issues, microbiological criteria and thermal treatment processes, as well as a proposed AMS Sanitary Certificate for Exports for Milk and Milk Products for Human Consumption to Morocco that reflected all the suggested changes. On November 12, , we received the good news that the government of Morocco had accepted the proposed certificate—without further revision, concluding more than three years of negotiations.  The certificate’s acceptance means this important market will remain open to U.S. exports, paving the way for an even better year for the U.S. dairy industry. USDA and AMS are no strangers to keeping U.S. export markets open.  In , the same interagency team responded quickly to changes in China’s regulatory requirements for U.S. dairy exports.  Their work helped to secure a market worth $1 billion annually. We’re committed to keeping dairy and all other U.S. agricultural exports flowing.  By maintaining and expanding export markets, we help to strengthen our rural communities that produce the high-quality, American-grown products consumers worldwide desire.  And that’s good for everyone.

"Senior Trade Advisor, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Jun 20,  Driscoll’s berries being sold in a store (Photograph courtesy of Driscoll’s. Copyright . All rights reserved.) Two years ago this month, the United States and the European Union (EU) implemented an organic equivalence arrangement, meaning products that are certified as organic in the U.S. can also be sold as organic in the EU, and vice versa. This arrangement broke down many of the barriers that organic producers, especially small and medium-sized farmers, were facing in exporting their goods to one of their largest markets. It has also proved to be a good example of how we can recognize each others' systems and work together across borders to arrive at beneficial agreements. The U.S. and EU have some of the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and the organic equivalence arrangement recognizes these standards and uses them for everyone’s benefit. Before the agreement, growers and companies wanting to trade products on both sides of the Atlantic had to obtain separate certifications to two different standards, which meant a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. Now, if a product is certified organic by one party, it can bear both the USDA organic seal and the EU organic logo, without going through that second certification process. This is possible because the EU and the U.S. have recognized that though our regulatory systems are different, they both produce high quality organic food and agricultural products under rigorous programs. Secretary Vilsack, while addressing the EU agricultural ministers earlier this week, had the same message of cooperation in regards to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). “We also need to focus on reducing the impact of the differences in our regulatory and standard-setting systems. For companies on both sides of the Atlantic, this is perhaps the most promising – and challenging – area for cooperation in T-TIP,” Vilsack said. “The U.S. and the EU have the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and nothing we do through T-TIP will undermine this. But there are steps that can be taken to better align our regulatory and standard-setting processes by improving transparency, participation and accountability. The U.S.-EU organic equivalency agreement, which took effect two years ago this month, is a good example of how we can recognize each other’s systems and facilitate trade to the benefit of both sides.” The organic arrangement expands market access, reduces duplicative requirements and reduces certification costs while protecting organic integrity.  The U.S. and EU work together to promote organic production and share technical information and best practices in an effort to further enhance the integrity of organic crops and livestock production systems. Carmela Beck, the National Organic Program Manager for Driscoll’s, an exporter of fresh berries, said the equivalency agreement has greatly simplified the export process, reduced confusion and redundancy and provided an opportunity for organic farmers. “The passage of the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement is a great success story and is a testament to the rigor of both the U.S. and EU organic standards,” Beck said.” Not only has the flow of trade been increased but the National Organic Program and the European Commission continue to work diligently to protect organic integrity in a global economy. Organic farmers now have even more opportunity to grow their businesses to meet this growing, global demand for organic products.” Amy’s Kitchen is one American company that has seen the benefit of the organic equivalence arrangement. Amy’s has seen a tenfold increase in its UK and EU business. “Since the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement took effect, Amy’s Kitchen is now able to export products directly from its U.S. manufacturing facilities,” said Andy Berliner, CEO and Co-founder of Amy’s Kitchen. ""This has led to a tremendous increase in business for Amy’s across the board, including the ability to share information about Amy’s foods being organic in the UK and EU on our packaging, a rise from 15 to more than 60 products now offered in the UK and EU over the last five years.” The partnership, while providing a strong foundation to globally promote organic agriculture, is also a win for the American economy. Industry estimates show that the market for U.S. organics sales to the EU could grow more than 300 percent, from $70 million to $300 million, a huge boost for a growing sector of our agricultural economy. It also means higher incomes for organic farmers and ranchers, more opportunities for small businesses, and jobs for people who package, ship, and market organic products. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and Foreign Agricultural Service, along with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, were instrumental in developing the organic equivalency agreement between the EU and U.S. and have also worked to develop similar agreements with Canada and Japan.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Dairy Programs in  Trade  Jun 19,  U.S. dairy exports are currently valued at $6 billion and the country is the world’s leading exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. USDA Photo Courtesy of Scott Bauer. Every June, USDA joins the rest of the country to celebrate Dairy Month. It is a time to thank our nation’s dairy producers and processors for their tireless work to produce quality dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt. Here at USDA, besides getting our fill of our favorite dairy products, we celebrate our nation’s dairy industry every day by finding new markets where people can enjoy their products. This often entails working with other countries’ governments to negotiate export and import requirements as well as helping businesses meet these requirements. Our nation’s dairy exporters reach new markets with the help of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). Export certificates are often the critical piece in the trade puzzle. On this front, AMS offers certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports. Our Dairy Programs can verify that businesses’ dairy products meet export requirements. The AMS Dairy Grading Branch provides export certificates for products or conditions for which they have documentation for or from plants they inspect. Certificates are paper or electronic documents which describe and attest to attributes of consignments of food destined for international trade. Certification of food may be based on a range of inspection activities including continuous online inspection, auditing of the quality assurance system, and examination of finished products. With the help of export certificates, importers can confidently receive products that meet requirements agreed upon by the U.S. and the importing country. As a result, people all over the world enjoy U.S. dairy products. In recent years, AMS helped open up U.S produced products to several major importing nations. In March , our agency enhanced its system, enabling the availability of electronic sanitary export certificates to China. Now exporters can request their China sanitary export certificates using the Electronic Document Creation System (eDocs). China is the world’s largest importer and is currently the second largest export destination for U.S. dairy products. Working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), AMS helped 240 U.S. dairy and infant formula firms get audited and registered to export products to China using our eDocs system. Another example of AMS connecting exporters to new markets happened in when the Customs Union (CU) trade bloc -- composed of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia -- came into existence. A new U.S. – CU dairy veterinary certificate was to resume trade in those countries. Trade was halted in when the CU demanded changes to the current U.S. export health certificate. Negotiations continued until March when AMS was notified that all members of the CU accepted a U.S. proposed export certificate for pasteurized milk products.  The U.S. government interagency team is discussing additional administrative steps before issuing certificates. In addition to negotiating export certificate agreements with other countries, AMS has created a number of resources that will help dairy exporters. We encourage you to check out our Dairy Exports website. We recently held 20 webinar trainings that helped exporters become familiar with our systems. Our sites are equipped with important documents, frequently asked questions, and key contacts. The effort to increase the number of export destinations for U.S. dairy businesses will help continue a positive trend for the industry. In the last 10 years, dairy exports have averaged a 21% increase per year. Currently, U.S. dairy exports are valued at $6 billion and the country is the world’s leading single country exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. AMS is proud to be a leader when it comes to increasing demand for U.S. dairy exports. Whether it’s June or any other time of the year, we are committed to supporting our nation’s dairy producers and processors. We want to make sure that people all over the world can enjoy their quality products. AMS offers a number of services to help U.S. dairy exporters reach new markets. Offering certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports, AMS has helped the export industry average a 21% increase per year over the last 10 years. USDA Photo.

"Announces Organic Crop Insurance, Other Measure  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .13  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  Washington, May 14, ― Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today discussed his vision for U.S. organic agriculture and USDA efforts to ensure its continued success during remarks to the Organic Trade Association. Vilsack announced a number of changes and new initiatives to support the continued growth of organic agriculture, including that the USDA's Risk Management Agency's (RMA) federal crop insurance program will increase coverage options for organic producers this year and provide even more options in , including a contract price addendum as well as new premium price elections for organic crops. Additionally, RMA will remove the current five-percent organic rate surcharge on all future crop insurance policies beginning in .Vilsack also said USDA will be providing new guidance and direction on organic production to all USDA agencies in support of organic agriculture and markets. USDA is now asking each agency to routinely address the needs of the organic sector in their programs and services where appropriate. The National Organic Program has supported the continued growth of America's organic sector, which has been increasing market share each year and now is a more than $30 billion industry. Vilsack noted that accurate is the biggest obstacle for developing better crop insurance options for organic farmers and expressed his desire that Congress help USDA make further progress by renewing the Organic Initiative as part of a new Food, Farms and Jobs bill.""Organic agriculture is one of the fastest growing segments of American agriculture and helps farmers receive a higher price for their product as they strive to meet growing consumer demand,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""These new options will extend the safety net provided by crop insurance and provide fair and flexible solutions to organic producers. Coupled with the new guidance for agencies to support this growing sector, USDA recognizes that organics are gaining market share and is helping boost this emerging segment.""New crop-insurance pricing options will be available to organic producers who grow crops under guaranteed contracts beginning with the crop year. This contract price option allows organic producers who receive a contract price for their crop to get a crop insurance guarantee that is more reflective of the actual value of their crop. They will have the ability, where available and at their choice, to use their personal contract price as their price election or to choose existing crop insurance price elections. This contract price option will be available for between 60 and 70 crops in the crop year and this contract price feature will be available to the majority of insured organic crops. RMA is also changing organic transitional yields (t-yields) so they will be more reflective of actual organic farming experience, starting with the crop year.All crops are being evaluated for establishing organic prices for the crop year. Current pricing options only allow farmers to insure organic crops at the conventional prices, with the exception of eight crops (corn, soybeans, cotton, processing tomatoes, avocados, and several fresh stone fruit crops) that already have premium organic price elections. RMA is working to provide organic price elections for six to ten crops in . Oats and mint are two crops that have already been selected for organic price elections in , and apricots, apples, blueberries, millet, and others are still under consideration.USDA's Agriculture Marketing Service last year announced the Organic Literacy Initiative, a public outreach and employee training program to help connect current and prospective organic operations with appropriate USDA resources. To date, over 14,000 USDA employees have taken the basic training on USDA's role in organic agriculture. The new guidance will further improve USDA agencies' ability to incorporate the needs of the growing organic sector into their programs and services. These combined actions should result in staff better equipped to help organic farmers obtain technical and financial assistance, insure crops and livestock, access research findings, secure loans, develop conservation practices, find current organic price information, and access local, regional, and international markets. Through this effort, agencies will also better understand the scope and rigor of the certification process and how it complements their own programs.Organic certification allows farmers and ranchers to receive premium prices for their value-added products. Over the past 10 years, the number of certified organic farms and businesses in the United States has expanded to approximately 17,750, representing a 240 percent increase since USDA first began collecting this . Similarly, the retail value of the organic industry grew almost 9.5 percent in to $31.4 billion. Organic foods continue to gain market share in the food industry, climbing to 4.2 percent of U.S. retail food sales in .USDA has already made several changes to better serve organic customers, including offering more flexible microloans and improving Federal crop insurance programs. To help open new markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers, USDA has streamlined trade with multiple foreign governments. These trade partnerships allow U.S. organic products to be sold as organic in Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, and Japan without maintaining certification to multiple standards. Expanding the reach of U.S. organic products creates opportunities for small businesses and increases jobs for Americans who grow, package, ship and market organic products.USDA is responsible, under the Organic Foods Production Act of (OFPA), for establishing national standards for organically-produced agricultural products. The National Organic Program has been critical for the development of clear standards and enforcing a level playing-field for organic businesses, which has lead to expanded trade opportunities to create new markets for U.S. organic businesses. These standards assure consumers that products with the USDA organic seal meet consistent, uniform standards.

GAP is a voluntary program that verifies its participants follow U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and industry best practices to minimize risks of food safety hazards when producing, handling, and storing fruits, vegetables, and other specialty crops. In , AMS conducted nearly 4,000 traditional GAP audits.

"National Hunger Fellow, and Julie Curti, Acting Deputy Director, USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 30,   What better way to end the day than by uncovering local food powerhouses in the Nation’s Capital! On Wednesday, April 21, , the USDA and HHS Centers for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships convened to visit two jewels located in Washington, DC: Common Good City Farm of Ledroit Park and Healthy Solutions of Anacostia. Common Good City Farm is an urban farm and education center growing food for low-income residents in the city and providing educational opportunities for all people to increase food security, and improve human health and environmental sustainability.  Common Good City Farm was funded in part by a National Institute for Food and Agriculture Community Food Project Grant. The University of the District of Columbia’s 4-H Club has just partnered with the farm to help their kids learn to grow and eat healthy food.  Supported by USDA, the goal of the 4-H program is to assist young people in developing knowledge, skills, and attitudes that will enable them to become self-directing, responsible, productive citizens.  Common Good City Farm has been successful in part due to strong partnerships with organizations like the 4-H Club, as well as community support from organizations like the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and Mount Bethel Baptist Church. Next, we journeyed across the river to visit a Healthy Solutions youth cooking class. Started by Tanikka Cunningham, Healthy Solutions’ mission is to promote healthy lifestyles in underserved communities.  The students cooked up and ate four delicious dishes that included a fruit salad, a mesclun spring salad, an eggplant pasta sauce, and a tri-colored pasta dish. Healthy Solutions works in Alabama, North Carolina, and Washington, DC to create community-based food systems that allow access to healthy affordable foods.  The organization also focuses on agricultural job creation and training, healthy living education, and youth development.  Healthy Solutions operates a produce coop in DC and sells food to local corner shops in the neighborhood. There are only three major chain grocery stores east of the Anacostia River, so the impact of Healthy Solutions, which brings 10,000 pounds of fresh produce into these communities each month, is critical.  The Obama Administration’s proposed Healthy Food Financing Initiative would send more resources to help bring access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food to communities like Anacostia. The Healthy Solutions kids enjoy their meal.   Healthy Solutions students cooked up and ate four delicious dishes that included a fruit salad, a mesclun spring salad.

"Partnerships Help Accelerate Forest Restoration, Increasing Benefits, Decreasing Threats  We cannot care for public forests and grasslands alone—the land benefits the most when communities join us and provide input to help shape forest plans. The U.S. Forest Service takes pride in being part of the communities we serve, whether by managing the land to be resilient to disturbance or as members of the public participating as citizens in the towns where we live and work. Spurred by Secretary Tom Vilsack’s vision that emphasizes collaboration with stakeholders and restoration of the Nation’s forests, the Forest Service published the report Increasing the Pace of Restoration and Job Creation on Our National Forests in .

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 02,  International School Meals Day raises awareness of the importance of food and nutrition in education and offers an opportunity for students to share school feeding experiences from across the globe. March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  The upsurge in healthy eating and food security campaigns is really resonating with schoolchildren, so much so, that a day has been set aside for youth around the world to share their experiences.  The celebration of this movement – International School Meals Day – draws our attention to the importance of good nutrition for all children. March 3 marks the fourth consecutive year that USDA will partner with the United Kingdom to invite children from across the globe to promote nutrition and school meals, this year focusing on introducing fresh and healthy local fare into their diets. On that day children will connect through social media to share their food experiences and healthy eating habits. I’m looking forward to witnessing the fun first-hand at Glen Forest Elementary School in Fairfax County, Va., where students will Skype with their peers at Washingborough Academy in the UK. I’m sure it will be a great learning experience for the students and me alike. In the last decade the momentum for healthier eating has found a place in the world’s conscience.  The International School Meals Day initiative literally brings together the world’s children to elevate awareness on the importance of nutritional quality in school meal programs while raising universal consciousness of hunger and poverty. As a lifelong school nutrition advocate I am delighted by the progress that’s been made both domestically and internationally to improve the nutrition and well-being of our youth. To see children the world over embrace this health movement is inspiring. So on behalf of USDA I offer a heartfelt “thank you” to the organizers of International School Meals Day and all those who participate. You are helping ensure a brighter and healthier future for our world!

"Director, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Oct 25,  American Indian students at Navajo Technical College, in Crownpoint, New Mexico, are using new lab and equipment to develop the veterinary skills they need to work with large animals. (Photo courtesy of Navajo Technical College) Oct. 20, , is an important milestone in our nation’s history in regards to equity in research, education, and extension. On that date, 29 tribal colleges, representing different histories, cultural orientations, and organizational structures, received land-grant university (LGU) status. Such LGU status gave these institutions—referred to as LGUs—access to federal resources to help improve the lives of tribal students, while respecting sovereignty and promoting self-sufficiency in American Indian communities. In the ensuing 23 years, significant progress has occurred in building capacity at the land-grant system to better serve Native American students and communities. The s are part of the family of land-grants that the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports through research, education, and extension programs. These programs recruit and retain students in the food and agricultural sciences, enhance economic opportunities and quality of life, improve nutrition and health, and protect natural resources and the environment. The tribal colleges and universities, now numbering 34, are located in 13 states and provide access to higher education to over 80 percent of Indian Country. Collectively, they enroll approximately 20,000 students and provide vital services to some 50,000 tribal community members. Unlike most institutions of higher education, the s teach in a cultural context that empowers students by drawing on the strength of their people’s histories, indigenous knowledge, and traditions. The s provide much-needed high school completion (GED), basic remediation, job training, college preparatory courses, and adult basic education programs. They serve as community libraries and centers, tribal archives, career and business centers, economic development centers, public meeting places, and elder and child care centers. Examples of the strength of community, education, pride, and opportunity abound in Indian Country. Here are just a few: Chief Dull Knife College, in Lame Deer, Montana, developed welding courses to train apprentice welders to find jobs that could eventually triple the average salary of their Cheyenne reservation. At Fort Totten, North Dakota, Cankdeska Cikana Community College provided the Spirit Lake Tribe citizens new extension education that helped reduce diabetes and improved health. The Institute of American Indian Arts, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is integrating agricultural science into every curriculum, linking them to American Indian worldviews, stories, and tradition. Join me in congratulating our institutions on their 23rd Anniversary. As we look into the future, there is much more work to be done, and the partnership between NIFA and s will continue to grow and be healthy, reflecting the rich history and culture of the American Indian peoples. While respecting sovereignty, we hope all of us succeed in our efforts to serve the people and the land. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Powerful Partnerships Feed Hungry Milwaukee Kids in the Summertime   An African proverb holds that it takes a village to raise a child. And what’s a village? Well, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it’s the Milwaukee Hunger Task Force (the State’s largest food bank and anti-hunger advocacy organization), Kohl’s Department Stores, Milwaukee Public Schools, the Salvation Army, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Social Development Commission and the Milwaukee Park System. When the school year ends, many children and teens who rely on USDA school meals are at a higher risk of going hungry during the summer when school is not in session. USDA’s Summer Food Service Program can make sure that kids don’t go hungry summer, but the program can’t work without sponsors and supportive communities.  Ollice C.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  May 11,   The United Kingdom (UK) has long played an important role in U.S. agricultural exports. This history dates back to the completion of the Erie Canal in the early s, which linked the Great Lakes to the Atlantic seaboard, significantly increasing the export of food, particularly Midwestern wheat, to England. To this day, the United Kingdom offers tremendous opportunities for U.S. agriculture and the United States exports more than $1.6 billion annually in agricultural, fish and forestry products to the UK. Many of these products are showcased each year during USDA-endorsed trade shows, such as the International Food Exhibition (IFE), which took place in London in March. Nineteen U.S. companies participated in the U.S. Pavilion, including 11 new-to-market and new-to-export companies. Several U.S. companies were lucky enough to meet with the Olympic Organizing Committee that had a team looking for products to be used at the Summer Olympics in London in . The exhibition produced $469,000 in on-site sales and $1.9 million in projected 12-month sales. Robin Rhea, owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., is pictured here during the International Food Exhibition (IFE) in London. During the show, U.S. exhibitors introduced more than 100 new products, ranging from sauces to baby food to ice cream. Delicious sauces are the name of the game for Slather Brand Foods Inc., a new-to-export company who explored export opportunities as part of the U.S. pavilion. Robin Rhea is the owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., based in Charleston, South Carolina. As a Southern U.S. Trade Association (SUSTA) member, she learned about the assistance USDA’s market development programs provide to companies like hers. Ms. Rhea used Market Access Program (MAP) funding in order to participate in this year’s show in London, a first for her company. She credits her attendance at the show with helping her connect with potential exporters and assess the opportunity to sell her product outside of the United States. “The UK market is definitely ready for Slather Brand Slatherin' Sauce,” said Ms. Rhea. “There is very little competition to speak of in the sauce category.  Moreover, the UK is just coming into its own in terms of BBQ and they are hungry for diversified products. In addition to retail markets there was an overwhelming interest in the food service industry and it will top our targeted list when we are ready to export.” The company plans to continue to expand its domestic reach in the coming year and explore exports as part of its business plan in . The knowledge and contacts Slather Brand Foods gained from attendance at IFE have prepared the company for this venture. To learn more about market development programs, visit the FAS website.

"USDA Tribal Collaboration Strengthens Food Security on Nevada's Indian Reservations  Today in Nevada more than one in four children live in households that cannot reliably provide nutritious meals every day.  This dubious distinction makes it the state with the nation’s fourth highest rate of child hunger.  And for children living on Indian reservations, the incidence of hunger may be even higher. What does food insecurity look like on Nevada reservations?  With few places to shop, reservation residents have very limited access to fresh produce.  Food insecurity not only equates to a lack of nutritious foods available, but also means families must drive great distances to a grocery store.  To cope, families choose more canned and frozen foods that will last until the next weekly or monthly shopping trip, which often means less consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Melissa Baker, Program Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service, Western Region Special Nutrition Programs  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 18,   Respond to this story","What are some consequences of food insecurity for families living on Nevada Indian reservations, particularly when it comes to accessing nutritious foods?","For families living on Nevada Indian reservations, food insecurity leads to limited access to fresh produce, reliance on canned and frozen foods that last longer, resulting in reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables."

"Boston Beats the Asian Longhorned Beetle  One of the things I consider a highlight of my career and that I will always remember is our successful response to the July detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) in Boston, Massachusetts.  As I attended the May 12 ceremony commemorating the eradication of the ALB infestation in Boston and listened to the speakers share their thoughts about what it took to get us there, I had a deep sense of appreciation for the partnership among the state and federal cooperators who worked together to bring us to that day.  It was swift action and continued diligence that protected Boston’s trees from further destruction. APHIS and its cooperators were able to accomplish the goal of eradicating ALB in Boston in less than 4 years.  Thanks also go to a community member who reported the infestation early.  That early detection and report resulted in the loss of only 6 infested trees. But as I celebrate our first victory over the invasive pest in Massachusetts, I am compelled to ask you to remain vigilant in inspecting your trees regularly for signs of the beetle and report any suspicious damage to your State Plant Health Director.

"Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 21,   If you haven’t heard the buzz, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service’s expansion of the Team Up for School Nutrition Success  initiative is in full swing, with 20 completed trainings and 14 more scheduled for . Team Up offers a unique learning experience that enhances schools’ food service operations through training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals looking to maintain a healthy environment and encourage strong student meal program participation. What exactly happens at a Team Up training? Ever had an “a-ha” or a “why didn’t I think of that” moment when a friend shares a really great idea? Team Up is where “a-ha” moments are shared among school nutrition professionals and turned into action back via their school meals programs. Let’s break down a Team Up workshop to see how these “a-ha” moments transpire. A peer mentor shares her best practices for menu planning during the Wisconsin Team Up training. Best Practice Panel Presentations  Great ideas are meant for sharing. Team Up workshops kick off with panels where participants hear school nutrition peer mentors share their best practices and strategies for issues like increasing school meal program participation, menu planning and financial management. At the Georgia Team Up training, participants share ideas and questions for menu planning and increasing program participation. Breakout Sessions  This is where the magic happens! After listening to best practice presentations, participants break out into small groups for a round of brainstorming and problem-solving around each specific topic, all with best practice ideas in mind. Using the Egan Skilled Helper Model, which uses an opportunity-development approach, school nutrition peer mentors guide and facilitate discussions as participants identify their program challenges and develop solutions with their peers.  During the breakout sessions, participants examine: What is going on in my school nutrition program? What does a better outcome look like? How do I get to the better outcome? How do I make it all happen?  The Action Plan  Participants examined their challenges and solutions and excitement is building around progress and potential opportunities identified during the breakout sessions. What do participants do with all of these great ideas? Peer mentors help participants put their specific strategies and solutions into an action plan using SMART goals, which are defined as goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time‐bound. Participants take their action plan home as a guide to implement their Team Up strategies and solutions in their school nutrition programs.  Resources  Operating a school meals program can be challenging, but school nutrition directors don’t have to do it alone. Team Up workshops invite allied organizations to share their free school nutrition resources that support school food service operations and help create a healthy school environment. Participants can use these resources as they move forward with implementing their action plan in their school nutrition programs.  Networking is another valuable resource Team Up workshops provide, giving school nutrition directors opportunities to develop working relationships with their peer mentors and other school nutrition directors in their state. Many directors who have attended a Team Up training have expressed that they’re not alone and can turn to their fellow director. “I can now see what areas I need to work and improve on in my program. I see that I am not alone in my journey. I have many helpful people that I can rely on for help and guidance. The Team Up training was valuable to me because I am more comfortable talking to my peers. I see I am not alone and I can ask for help.” – Rebecca Lusk, Manager/Supervisor, Towns County Schools, Hiawassee, Ga.  After the Workshop  The Team Up workshop may be complete, but the Team Up spirit lives on. After returning home, participants roll up their sleeves, take a deep breath, and take the first steps outlined in their Team Up action plan - and then real life happens. Barriers pop up as action plans are implemented, but there’s no reason to get discouraged. Team Up peer mentors and state agencies are still available should participants have questions or get stuck with their action plan. In addition, USDA together with the Institute of Child Nutrition hosts monthly webinars for school nutrition professionals to expand their knowledge and tools on a wide variety of topics; webinars recordings are made available online for later viewing.  And this is why Team Up workshops are so effective – Team Up encourages school nutrition professionals to continue to network with their peers and problem-solve school nutrition program barriers long after the workshop is completed. No one is an island, and we must team up to make school meals accessible, nutritious and delicious!  For more information about the Team Up for School Nutrition Success initiative, check out the Team Up Web site and these guest blogs authored by former participants in the Team Up workshops.  For more information on other training and resources available to school nutrition professionals, visit our Healthier School Day web site.

"Amy Mazerall and Mydina Thabet, Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 14,  Food service staff serves barbeque chicken to students. (Photo courtesy of Right Light Photography, LLC) The school nutrition community is celebrating National School Lunch Week from October 10-14. This year’s theme “Show Your Spirit” is all about encouraging parents, students and school officials to show their spirit for school lunch. Through the Team Up for School Nutrition Success (Team Up) initiative, school nutrition professionals have teamed up to provide nutritious and appealing meals to students, offering plenty of reasons for all of us to show spirit for awesome school meals! The Team Up initiative, created through a partnership between the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and the Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN), provides school nutrition professionals a unique learning experience.  The initiative is designed to enhance schools’ food service operations by providing training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals who want to maintain a healthy environment and strong student meal program participation. The goal of this training is to help schools find simple ways to meet the updated USDA nutrition standards from the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA), while increasing the number of students enjoying healthy and flavorful school meals. Donna Harris, the former Child Nutrition Director for Perquimans County Schools in North Carolina, attended the first Team Up pilot training in in the Southeast Region. Harris was seeking better way to engage students in school meals. During this Team Up training, she learned best practices, tips and tricks for increasing participation in school meals through panel presentations by school nutrition peer mentors. After the presentations, Harris joined other school nutrition directors to network and brainstorm on creative solutions for common topics such as menu planning and financial management.  Directors turned their ideas into achievable goals as they created action plans using SMART goals with the help of their peer mentors. SMART goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. In her action plan, Harris wanted to tackle increasing school meal program participation in the district’s middle and high schools, so she set SMART goals to obtain student feedback and create student-approved menus. Back at her district, she conducted two student surveys and group discussions to gauge student preference.  As a result, several new student-approved recipes were added to the menu: barbeque chicken, buffalo chicken wraps, chicken salad wraps and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Although students had not responded well to meals that align with these updated nutrition standards in the past, Harris received positive feedback on the additions once she engaged students in nutrition education, explaining the USDA nutrition standards that schools must follow. In fact, the school’s student government association assisted in explaining the nutrition standards to students.  Harris demonstrated that when students have a voice in school menus and understand the USDA nutrition standards, they are more satisfied and more likely to purchase school meals.  This was evidenced by a notable increase in student meal counts on the days that new menu items were offered. Even school staff provided positive feedback: “the lunches taste good!” and “it was delicious!” Harris has since retired from Perquimans County Schools, but before her departure, she shared her action plan and best practices learned from the Team Up training with the new director. Harris wanted to see the Team Up spirit live on and encouraged the child nutrition department to utilize the Team Up peer mentorship model to train school nutrition staff. FNS also wanted to see the Team Up initiative live on after the Team Up training pilot received rave reviews from attendees. In , FNS hosted an additional six regional trainings to school nutrition professionals nationwide. The regional trainings were equally successful, and now the Team Up initiative has been expanding to state agencies in . So far, 26 trainings have been completed in 25 states, with 11 more scheduled for the remainder of this year. To read about the success of completed State Team Up trainings, visit ICN’s website. Harris is one of many school nutrition professionals who inspire us to show spirit for school meals. FNS thanks all school nutrition staff who work tirelessly to provide our students a nutritious start to a bright future! During National School Lunch Week, we continue to celebrate the progress that has been made in school meals, child nutrition and the overall school environment over the last seven and a half years. USDA is committed to providing school nutrition professionals with the resources they need to help today’s children grow into tomorrow’s healthy leaders. FNS’ Team Nutrition is also celebrating National School Lunch Week by announcing the availability of a number of newly modernized and standardized recipes on the What’s Cooking?

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 25,  USDA’s What’s Shaking? resources offer creative ways to boost flavor with less sodium. (Click to enlarge) What’s shaking in USDA’s school meals programs?  Delicious and nutritious food, that’s what!  Healthy food does not have to be bland or boring.  There’s more to creating a tasty meal than just dousing food in dressing or layering on salty sauces.  It’s easy to make your dish pop without adding excess sodium.  Many schools around the country have figured out creative ways to serve low-sodium meals that maximize taste.  So what can you do this school year to “spice” things up and take school meals to the next level? Add flavor, not salt – Condiments like soy sauce, ketchup, barbecue sauce, and hot sauce may contain high amounts of sodium.  Fresh or dried herbs, spices, lemon or orange zest, or 100 percent fruit juices can enhance flavors in foods naturally. Cook with fresh food – When possible, cook with fresh produce or minimally processed foods like no-salt-added frozen or canned vegetables. Setting up farm to school arrangements help make this a cinch!  USDA Foods also offers a variety of options. Set up “Flavor Stations” – Create “flavor stations” in the cafeteria where students can add sodium-free herbs and spices such as basil, curry, black and red pepper, garlic, ginger, or rosemary to customize meals to their taste buds.  Flavor stations give students a chance to be the chef and create one-of-a-kind dishes! Check out “What’s Cooking?” – This USDA site features hundreds of low sodium, large quantity recipes for inspiration.  How about some “Rainbow Rice” or “Honey-Lemon Chicken”?  Yes, please!   Shop around – Pay attention to sodium levels when you’re purchasing food.  The amount can vary widely from brand to brand.  Be sure to write bids that specifically request lower sodium options. Does your school have any other creative ways to boost flavor while still promoting healthy, low-sodium diets?  Share them with us in the comments section below!  To find more USDA resources for schools to maximize taste without maximizing sodium, check out our What’s Shaking? site.

When George Washington Carver laid out key elements of his blueprint for education, he could never have guessed that the cutting-edge work of 21st century agricultural science would find a 7,000-acre rural home—right in the middle of the maze of highways and high-rises, homes and businesses that make up the Washington metropolitan region. One hundred years after the federal government first began buying huge tracts of farmland, meadows and woods outside the District of Columbia, a group of scientists, researchers, students and other volunteers who work at the sprawling Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) are taking a page out of the renowned scientist’s book—literally, a textbook. The whole idea, as laid out in Carver’s “Nature Study and Gardening For Rural Schools,” is making sure school kids get their hands dirty. In that spirit, volunteers from the Beltsville Area Diversity Task Force and its technology, education and outreach group started planning about a year ago for an unassuming project for students that would echo Carver’s “learning by doing” educational philosophy. The idea of establishing an old-fashioned victory garden that would continue outreach efforts to students in local schools seemed to be a perfect match. The Student Discovery Garden, as it has come to be known, has been up and growing since last spring, fueled by the energy of volunteers and students. The garden, all organic with raised beds, includes seven sections, each focusing on one of the research programs at BARC, including breeding native crops to keeping non-native species from pushing their way in.  Another learning experience for an all-organic garden was an infestation of Colorado potato bugs that were laboriously smashed one at a time.  Another addition to the urban students’ knowledge base: They found out that stink bugs really live up to their name!

"Field Ecologist in  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 30,  Forest Service field ecologist Jimmy Grogan at the Marajoara field site in southeast Pará, Brazil. The ‘sororoca’ plant with the wide leaves is a relative of the banana. Although the photo was taken in the daytime, the light is low because the researchers are in the forest understory. Photo by M. Loveless I have lived and worked abroad for most of my adult life, including many years in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, so it was not too difficult adjusting to life in the Brazilian Amazon. I learned to speak Portuguese in the field; my tutors were the field assistants that I hired locally. The politics of doing research on this species are challenging and complicated. That side of my research has been almost as educational and fascinating as the actual fieldwork.  I’ve been fortunate to live and work in remote forests where there are no villages or towns nearby, no noise or light pollution, no electricity, and no running water when the streams dry up during the dry season. Under those conditions, it’s possible to experience forest life on a very satisfying level. As a plant ecologist, I can observe the daily and seasonal rhythms of growth and dormancy at the level of the forest community — by that I mean the growth and flowering and fruiting schedules that trees and other plants keep through the year and from year to year. When you are there every day in the middle of it, these rhythms gradually come into focus, and the forest comes alive in a way that feels completely integrated. Many people find it surprising to learn that the Brazilian rain forest and the other tropical forests I’ve worked in are not perpetually wet and steaming. Mahogany only grows naturally in tropical forests that have a pronounced dry season for one-third to one-half of the year. When that happens, the streams dry up, the trees drop their leaves, the understory goes brown, the ticks and deerflies come out, and everything gets wilted in the heat until the rains come back. The most important thing people should know about mahogany is the same thing they should know about other living species that we humans consume – if consumption exceeds supply indefinitely, supply will vanish.

"Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 01,  The adult periodical cicada emerges from its 17-year nymph stage, molts and arises as a winged adult. This spring will see the return of the large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. (U.S. Forest Service photo/ Bob Rabaglia) The buzz this spring has started, and some people may think it’s fodder for a new sci-fi movie. But this year’s spring brings a drama closer to home than you think - the pending emergence of brood II of the periodical cicada. Cicadas are large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. As the male cicadas sing their intense mating songs, some brand it as the sound of summer. “Annual cicadas, known as dog-day cicadas in the U.S., are found throughout the world,” said Sandy Liebhold, a research entomologist with the U.S Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “But the periodical cicadas emerge in massive groups known as “broods” once every 13 or 17 years and are completely unique to North America.” There are 15 brood cycles, each designated by roman numerals. In the U.S., brood II is on track to crawl out of the ground very soon after a 17-year hiatus. They’ll emerge into one of the most densely populated urban/suburban forests in the world. The mass emergence of brood II into the state and private forests of the tri-state area of eastern Connecticut, upstate New York, and northern New Jersey will sound a bit different than the familiar dog-day cicadas. Male cicadas use a special membrane to echo a series of clicks through its abdomen to attract females for reproduction. In chorus, the brood may sound like an insect-sized fleet of jets preparing for lift off, but the sound should be enjoyed as a wonderful spectacle of the mating ritual in the animal world. Once mated, females will lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind, known in the scientific world as oviposition injury, can be quite striking and lead to “flagging” -- the dieback of small limbs. Forest health aerial surveys conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported more than 8,700 acres with flagging left behind from the brood XIV emergence on Cape Cod in . The scarring is mostly superficial but can have a mild impact on the growth of individual host trees. However, the mass emergence can benefit the longer, overall health of eastern forests. After mating and laying eggs, adult cicadas die and fall to the forest floor. The nutrients released from the mass decay of the brood create a jolt of healthy nutrients available to forest organisms. Researchers have shown that this pulse of nutrition leads to an increase of beneficial microbes and nitrogen in soil, increased tree growth and more robust wildflowers. Finally, after three to four weeks, the eggs hatch, the larvae wander under the forest floor where they feed on roots and start the process over again. So, why every 13 to 17 years? Scientists have been pondering this ecological phenomenon for centuries. “There is no doubt that by simultaneously emerging at those long intervals, periodical cicadas are able to saturate predators thereby maintaining high population levels,” said Liebhold. Recent research also hypothesizes that periodical cicadas emerge when predator birds are at a lower density, suggesting that these amazing insects have queued into a larger ecological cycle – wow! This is what we know but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding these time-travelling bugs. So if you find yourself one of the lucky ones to experience their visit, just sit back and enjoy this remarkable wonder of eastern forests. Michael Bohne is an entomologist and forest health group leader with the U.S. Forest Service in Durham, N.H. After mating, female cicadas lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind can lead to the dieback of small limbs called flagging. Such was the case for these bur oak trees in central Iowa in after a brood emergence of the 17-year cicada.

"and Lindsay K. Campbell, Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 11,  G.R.A.C.E Memorial in Glen Rock, New Jersey, is in Veterans Park directly across from the town's commuter train station. The site was chosen by the Glen Rock Assistance Council and Endowment after input of family members in the community directly affected by 9/11. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) Living memorials serve as a reminder of fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, neighbors and friends—but also of the power of community to reflect, rebuild and renew. Our research suggests that living memorials demonstrate the role of nature in contemporary times not only as a symbol, but as an innate and purposeful response to loss that calls forth a common humanity and compassion for others. In other words, they demonstrate how people use nature to be resilient to loss. For 13 years, the U.S. Forest Service has built upon a unique partnership called the Living Memorials Project centered on one of the most significant events in recent history: Sept. 11, , also referred to as 9/11, the day four carefully coordinated terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. That day, two passenger planes hit the World Trade Center’s twin towers in New York City, another flew into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a fourth originally targeting Washington crashed in a Shanksville, Pennsylvania, field after passengers tried to stop the hijackers. Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, created a memorial grove on the hospital campus. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The living memorials project began in when Congress asked the Forest Service to create a program that draws upon the resonating power of trees to bring people together and help foster healing in communities across the nation in response to 9/11. The project includes a grant program to support community-based greening efforts and a research component that developed a National Registry of living memorials across the country. This year, as communities gather to mark the 14th anniversary of 9/11, some will do so at local town memorial parks and gardens – living memorials that pay respect to those who lost their lives and thank thousands more who ran toward the chaos to help. This summer, a team from the agency’s Northern Research Station set out to revisit some of the sites listed on the Living Memorials Registry. Joined by Heather McMillen, an anthropologist and postdoctoral social scientist with the research station, the teams were curious to learn if the sites were maintained. If so, who takes care of them? Did circumstances and other events change the nature of the memorials or had they, over time, stood still? What story could the trees and the landscape itself tell us? From Connecticut's state memorial in Sherwood Island State Park on the Long Island Sound visitors have a panoramic view of lower Manhattan where the World Trade Center once stood. Victims’ families requested a memorial where they could experience the healing effects of water. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The sites range from forests such as Sterling Forest State Park in Tuxedo, New York. To beaches, like the Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, as well as city parks, community gardens, traffic islands, waterfront piers, street trees and arboretums. Many of the living memorial sites we visited 14 years ago still remain and continue to serve an important role for their local constituents. When asked, ‘What are you most proud of here?” nearly all of the site stewards responded, “That we did it.  And it’s still here.”  Many of the living memorials along the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut coast sustained heavy damage during Hurricane Sandy and were rebuilt and replanted. Some signs at the sites not only recognize a diverse list of supporters but also tell the story of that day from the perspective of local towns and communities, including personal sentiments regarding loved ones lost and for those who survived. In each case, local residents draw upon the landscape to create a place of comfort, reflection and a sense of beauty. As these places age, some areas do struggle with care and maintenance but are not giving up. Many families have planted survivor trees on sites and are eager to find ways to protect them as long as possible.      Updates from the field will be available on the Living Memorials Project website. Memorials created from - are displayed on a National Map that formed the basis of the public multi-media exhibition Land-Markings: 12 Journeys through 9/11 Living Memorials, created in collaboration with Parsons The New School for Design. The exhibit was on display in at the National Park Service’s Federal Hall National Memorial on Wall Street. The exhibit catalog and DVD are available free for public use. Videos can be viewed online. The Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, is situated on the coastal dunes of Long Island. The barrier beaches are considered the town’s greatest natural assets. “It was felt that this area possessed scenic beauty and views yet has sufficient open space to provide a quiet environment for remembrance and reflection.” (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry)  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Connecticut  Forestry  FS  Hurricane Sandy  Long Island  memorial  mourning  New Jersey  New York  New York City  Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry  Northern Research Station  Pennsylvania  remembrances  Research  September 11  trees  veterans  Washington DC","What role do living memorials, which utilize nature as an innate response to loss, play in fostering community resilience and reflecting collective humanity after significant events such as 9/11?","Living memorials serve as a reminder of the power of community to reflect, rebuild, and renew, demonstrating how people use nature to be resilient to loss and call forth common humanity and compassion for others."

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio. The world is not merely facing a challenge of sustainably producing enough food to feed a world whose population will exceed 9 billion by , but also confronting the continuous challenge of ensuring that nutritious and safe food reaches needy families, so that every child can have a safe and healthy childhood.  Combating this urgent crisis requires a global collaborative effort.  According to experts, by agricultural production will need to increase by 70% to meet increased demand for food, diet changes and additional demand for industrial uses for plants.  To help meet this goal, USDA has developed a Global Food Security strategy, focused on research, development, education and extension.  As part of USDA’s Office of the Chief Scientist series of white papers on USDA’s research portfolio, this plan aligns USDA’s food security research with the goals of President Obama’s Global Food Security Initiative, Feed the Future. In implementing the strategy, USDA will seek and build upon existing partnerships with research institutions at home and abroad, as well as in the private sector.  We are very heartened that our colleagues in other countries and donor organizations share our interest.  This May, the G8 Leaders announced the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition to improve food security in Africa.  The G8 Leaders also endorsed the establishment of global platforms to facilitate sharing of reliable agricultural and information, which is crucial for research, for decision making by farmers and to help connect them to the marketplace.   Similarly, the June Rio+20 Summit resolved to enhance agricultural science and improve productivity and sustainability through voluntary sharing of knowledge and good practices and by strengthening international cooperation on agricultural research.  These commitments made by USDA, the G8 and Rio+20 have been taken to the next level by the G20 whose leaders recently announced their support for a series of recommendations to sustainably increase agricultural productivity.  These steps include strengthening global collaboration and cooperation on agricultural science through a regular meeting of agricultural Chief Scientists (MACS) with the goal of identifying global research priorities and targets and facilitating collaboration between public and private sector organizations in the key areas most likely to drive sustainable agricultural productivity gains. These developments have a lot of promise for helping coordinate the fight against global hunger.  I encourage you to read more about USDA’s food security research and find out about the important role science plays in improving lives around the world.

"Moving Back to Rural America: Why Some Return Home and What Difference It Makes  Population loss persists in rural America, especially in more remote areas with limited scenic amenities. Communities in these areas are attuned to the annual out-migration of their “best and brightest” high school graduates, typically a third or more of each class. But stemming rural population loss--and spurring economic development--may depend less on retaining young adults after high school and more on attracting former residents some years later. Researchers at the University of Montana and USDA’s Economic Research Service visited 21 rural communities during and and conducted 300 interviews at high school reunions.

"Chief, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Survey Administration Branch in  Equity  Research and Science  Jun 23,  Last month, I had the honor to serve as keynote speaker for The Mule Train’s 54th anniversary. The Mule Train left Marks, Mississippi and traveled to Washington, D.C., on May 13, , as part of Dr. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.’s Poor People’s Campaign to demand economic justice since Marks resided in the poorest U.S. county at the time. However, Dr. King did not witness the Mule Train because he was assassinated the month before the demonstration. I learned the Mule Train created a legacy of community organizing, while meeting with the Quitman county’s mayors, farmers, farmworker organizations, high school scholars and others. For example, even though Marks is an agriculture community, the town did not have a grocery store for a few years. The community mobilized and they now have two grocery stores in Marks. I spoke to the community about information as power and subsequently shared USDA’s definition of a farm, which is any place from which $1,000 of more of agricultural products were produced and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the year. Many in the community found the definition helpful and significant. This information is critical for those in attendance (and for readers of this blog) who are small farmers and think they’re too small to share their voices in USDA’s NASS surveys and censuses. Every voice matters as these are used by decision makers from federal to local levels. These directly impact producers, their operations, families, communities, and industries.

They shared their insights on the event, their studies, and their future careers. Trey Blackhawk majors in Indigenous Science at Little Priest Tribal College in Winnebago, Nebraska. “A lot of rural communities are already in food deserts with limited access to fresh and nutritious foods,” Blackhawk said. “I believe as I get further into my studies, I can be that person that makes a change in rural communities, helping them establish sustainable food systems. Ines Frazier is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture at Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Texas. “I grew up in food insecure area, had watched people close to me die of chronic illness, and researched how the food system was exploitative in certain areas, thus my life’s mission was to help build up Black and Indigenous communities through their agriculture and food systems.” Ernest J. Dixon III is a junior studying Agribusiness at Alcorn State University in Lorman, Mississippi. “ I did not know about the different agencies in USDA; there are so many different opportunities out there for everyone to find their niche within agriculture.” “USDA Agricultural Liaisons (, 465 ) help students like myself find careers in agriculture,” Dixon remarked.

"Mountain Plains Regional Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Nutrition Security  Nov 08,  It was a sunny fall day in mid-October when I had the honor of visiting the Omaha Nation WIC program. Upon meeting WIC Director Jessika Free-Bass, I visited the Tribe's WIC garden, which they use to grow produce for client nutrition education. For the Omaha Tribe, nutrition education is a community effort. Free-Bass says that the Omaha Nation WIC program recognizes the importance of incorporating Indigenous foods and traditional cooking practices into the WIC experience to form a holistic approach to nutrition education. Recently, they have taken extra steps to spotlight foods indigenous to their community, as well as dishes and cooking methods traditionally used by the Umóⁿhoⁿ people. This year, the WIC garden grew tomatoes and WIC clients prepared tomato sauce. The garden also produced carrots, which the program used to teach ways to prepare baby food. The WIC garden is small, so the program partners closely with several community organizations to further its nutrition education efforts. For example, the nearby Umóⁿhoⁿ school garden donates squash and indigenous corn to the program for lessons. Omaha WIC also partners with the Nebraska Indian Community College, using their kitchen facilities to provide nutrition education sessions and cooking demonstrations. The WIC program aims to safeguard the health of income eligible women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods and information on healthy eating. As we celebrate Native American Heritage Month, I applaud the Omaha Nation for connecting mothers, young children, and the community in celebrating healthy, traditional food. It was a pleasure to see their efforts, and I take great pride in the role the WIC program plays in bringing greater health equity to people in our country.

"Legislative and Public Affairs, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in  Animals  Jun 01,  If you are moving this year from a location within the gypsy moth quarantine area to a location outside the quarantine area, please inspect outdoor household items for pests. This is a federal requirement for homeowners moving from gypsy moth quarantine areas. By complying with the law, you may also save a forest. Gypsy moths are destructive, invasive pests! European gypsy moth larvae feed on over 300 plant species including oak, aspen and elm. Gypsy moths have defoliated more than ates since . About 70% of susceptible forests have never been infested and are at risk. Male gypsy moths are brown and smaller than female gypsy moths, which are primarily white. Females lay fuzzy yellowish-brown egg masses from which caterpillars emerge bearing distinctive red and blue dots. Like many invasive insects, gypsy moths can spread long distances with human assistance. They are notorious hitchhikers and lay their eggs on patio furniture, grills, lawn mowers, children’s toys, and other outdoor items. Larvae can hide on untreated firewood or other wooden items such as pallets and crates. The good news is you can help stop them. If you are moving, use the self-inspection checklist (, 3.6 ) and remove any insects or egg masses you find. To learn more about protecting your neighborhood and how you can help, visit USDA’s Your Move Gypsy Moth Free website. To self-certify that your outdoor household items are free of gypsy moth, complete and sign the self-inspection checklist (, 3.6 ) or this online form.

"Director of the Office of Civil Rights, USDA Forest Service in  Equity  Initiatives  Feb 12,  Vice President Kamala D. Harris and First Gentleman Doug Emhoff. ""We are undaunted in our belief that we shall overcome—that we will rise up. This is American aspiration."" -Kamala D. Harris On the cold January night following her swearing in earlier in the day as the first woman vice president of the United States, Kamala D. Harris and First Gentleman Doug Emhoff stood before the Lincoln Memorial. The stoic face of Lincoln looked eastward, past some of the signposts of our history in the form of war memorials and monuments, all the way to the U.S. Capitol. The monuments before both Lincoln and Harris are symbols of American history; but this January, history was unfolding at Lincoln’s feet. In one day, Vice President Harris broke barriers for Black and South Asian people, for women and for the children of immigrants. As a Black woman, Harris would not have been able to hold office while Lincoln was living. Not until President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act would she have even been able to vote in many parts of our country. In the words of Sam Cooke’s hit song, “It’s been a long time coming, but I know a change gonna come.” Our agency is changing too. We embody our code and commitments (, 4 ) by doing the right things while building trust with each other and the people and communities we serve. When we live by our values, we show each other and the world that we mean it when we say that diversity and interdependence are at the core of who we are. And when others see the diversity of people who wear the same Forest Service uniform, they see a reflection of our respect for diversity in all things. On Jan. 20th, our country witnessed the glass ceiling break. Pioneers such as Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Jordan realized that this day would come. The significance of Vice President Harris assuming the second highest office in the federal government reminds us that progress is happening all around us. If we focus on our values, purpose and relationships, our agency can become a model for others. Historically, February is set aside to celebrate and focus on Black history, starting with slavery. Beyond the Capitol building and across the Atlantic sits West Africa, and prior to colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade, various scholars have noted how the ancestors of many Black Americans were African royalty and nobility from West and Central Africa. Both the African continent and the diaspora have been producing inventors, innovators and world changers throughout history and continue to do so today. This year, history has played out in real time. There is a renewed focus on civil and voting rights at all levels of society, including government. Overcoming systemic injustice is at the forefront of the American conversation, spurred on by Black leaders and allies. While there is still much work to do, Jan. 20th marked a major checkpoint in the belief that “we shall overcome.” We have momentum. Racial equality is one of the top four immediate priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration. As President Biden said in his Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, “Equal opportunity is the bedrock of American democracy, and our diversity is one of our country’s greatest strengths.” This Black History Month, where will we as an organization focus? My aim is that Black history is not only something we recognize and celebrate each February, but also presents a living history that informs our work every day.

"Deputy Administrator, Fruit and Vegetable Program in  Trade  Nov 07,  Fruit in crates. A webinar next Thursday will show Spanish-language producers how to get pricing, shipping, volume and other detailed information for hundreds of commodities. Photo courtesy Marty Ringlein This month, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is holding a webinar about agency services and programs in Spanish.  The webinar, entitled, An Introduction to USDA's Fruit and Vegetable Market News, will be Thursday, Nov. 15, , from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern time.  The webinar will provide insight and information on using the Market News portal.  Through the portal, users can generate free, customized on pricing, shipping, volume and other detailed information for hundreds of agricultural commodities at domestic and international wholesale markets, production areas and ports of entry.  Dr. Luis Fernando Palmer, AMS Fruit and Vegetable Market News international branch chief, will explain how the portal works and how your business can benefit from the information. This is the second in-language AMS webinar since October.  The first, entitled, An introduction to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA), provided information to help fruit and vegetable growers, packers, shippers, processors, wholesalers and retailers better understand how PACA establishes and enforces fair business practices across the industry.  Patrick Romero, PACA’s Western regional office director, hosted the webinar and shared insights into how PACA helps companies resolve business disputes while protecting the industry and, ultimately, your business. This particular set of webinars is timely, given that the U.S. recently celebrated National Hispanic Heritage month.  According to the most recent National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Census of Agriculture, more than 66,600 farms covering over 24.6 million acres of U.S. farmland are operated by individuals of Hispanic, Latino and Spanish origin.  The fact is, more and more farmers, producers and others in the industry have asked for Spanish-language resources and AMS is making every effort to meet their needs.  It’s not the first time we’ve held in-language webinars and I’m pleased to say that it won’t be the last.  As the produce industry continues to diversify, USDA will look for more ways to engage these growing audiences. The webinars, part of a series of free, interactive information tutorials about AMS programs and services, will also include an interactive question and answer section. Registration is and space is limited.  To register for the in-language sessions, or to learn about other webinars in the series, visit:  If you miss a webinar, just visit our webinar archive to view it online.

"Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Nov 17,   Did you know that Canada is the United States’ largest agricultural trading partner, accounting for 16 percent of all U.S. agricultural trade? In , U.S. agricultural exports to Canada were valued at $15.7 billion. Geographical proximity, similar business practices and eating habits make Canada an attractive export market for new-to-export and new-to-market U.S. companies. Some of Canada’s major agricultural imports from the United States include: fresh vegetables, snack foods, fresh fruits, processed fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, red meats, forest products and fish and seafood. Secretary Vilsack traveled to Canada in August to meet with Canadian trade group leaders as well as Gerry Ritz, the minister of agriculture in Canada. As part of these meetings, he discussed agricultural trade issues that both of our countries face and opportunities for collaboration. The Secretary was honored to serve as the primary spokesperson for U.S. agricultural products during this visit and to highlight their benefits and uses to compliment Canadian cuisine. Canada is the world’s fourth largest agricultural exporter, and Canada and the United States are each other’s largest export market for agricultural products.  Food production in Canada is highly integrated with the United States across a wide array of products that include livestock, fresh produce, and processed products. Free trade agreements, structural changes in U.S. and Canadian food industries, changes in consumer demand, and advances in technology have facilitated this integration over the past few decades. Canadians travel to the United States more than their foreign counterparts providing them with many opportunities to have a taste of the states. On these travels, it’s no surprise that our neighbors to the north find a variety of U.S. food products and regional flavors to whet their appetite. Many U.S. companies could use these opportunities to expand their customer base and may want to consider exporting to Canada. To assist U.S. companies in preparing their products and sales force to enter the market, FAS is offering a complimentary Webinar on Tuesday, November 23rd at 1 p.m.-2:00 p.m.(EST) titled The Basics of Exporting to Canada. This forum will provide U.S. companies with a basic overview of the Canadian food sector industry and initial information to make food products compliant to Canadian government standards.  If you are unavailable for the live session on November 23rd, the webinar will be archived and accessible until November . Free registration is available online here. If you have any questions, contact FAS/Canada at AgToronto@fas.usda.gov.

"Canoemobile inspires future conservation leaders!   A young girl looks fearfully at the large wooden canoe bobbing on the water. She steps into the canoe and it moves. She yelps, and is given a reassuring smile by her boat captain. She gets settled holding her paddle tightly, convinced with every movement that the canoe will capsize. The canoe takes off as everyone starts to paddle in sync in order to glide across the water. She begins to relax and enjoy herself, soaking up the sun, blue sky and fresh air. Before she knows it, the canoe is coming to dock, and she’s imagining her next adventure on the water.

"From West Virginia to Ohio, Food Fuels the Local Economy  West Virginia and Appalachian Ohio have a lot in common beyond their shared state border.  With a strong agricultural heritage, these vast rural areas are known for their forest and timber industries, and they are integrating food systems into local economic development. Earlier this month, I joined Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) Co-Chair Earl Gohl and Ohio’s State Rural Development Director Tony Logan to take a look at local food in the Buckeye state. My colleague, Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs Joani Walsh, recently made a similar trip to West Virginia. Organized by ARC, the visits were an opportunity to discuss how local food is diversifying the economy, developing a more competitive workforce and generating opportunities within regions like Appalachia. “Through our work on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, we know that there are lots of ways  that local foods are providing economic opportunities in rural communities,” said Walsh. “These  visits with ARC gave us a clearer picture of how that is happening in Appalachia.”  Doug O’Brien, Acting Under Secretary for Rural Development  Posted in  USDA Results  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Technology  Jun 17,   Respond to this story",What role are local food systems playing in diversifying the economy and generating opportunities in Appalachian regions like West Virginia and Ohio?,"Local food systems are diversifying the economy and generating opportunities in Appalachian regions by providing economic opportunities in rural communities, developing a more competitive workforce, and integrating into local economic development."

"The Real Story Behind Bats  As Halloween approaches, it is easy to get caught up in the mystery and fear that surround bats, but the truth about bats is that they are fascinating animals vital for a healthy environment and economy. As we celebrate National Bat Week, set your concerns aside. We need bats, and bats need us – now more than ever. Bats occupy almost every habitat in the world. They devour tons of insects nightly, pollinate flowers, and spread seeds that grow new plants and trees. They are our most important natural predators of night-flying insects, consuming mosquitoes, moths, beetles, crickets, leafhoppers and chinch bugs, among others. Many of these insects are serious crop or forests pests, while others spread disease to humans or livestock. Every year, bats save us billions of dollars in pest control by simply eating insects.

"Conservation versus Preservation?  Have you ever wondered why your favorite National Park is surrounded by a National Forest? Well, it didn’t happen by accident or guesswork. The fact is, it was all started over 100 years ago by two men I like to refer to as the founding fathers of America’s public lands. Back at the turn of the 20th Century Gifford Pinchot and John Muir had radically contrasting views of how to manage America’s wild lands and they worked tirelessly lobbying Congress and convincing Presidents to agree with them to start protecting open space.

The northeastern United States is home to about 175,000 farms that collectively produce agricultural commodities worth more than $21 billion per year. The most important commodities in the Northeast are dairy production and poultry, and about half of the field crops (including pasture) grown in the Northeast are for animal feed. Horticulture is a relatively large portion of total plant production in the Northeast, as are perennial fruits such as apples, pears, blueberries, and cranberries. Farms in the Northeast are on average smaller than in many other parts of the country, and a greater percentage of these are operated by women than in the rest of the United States.

"USDA Rural Development intern in  Rural  Jul 25,   After years of paying rent while wishing he could purchase his own home, 29-year-old Adam Brautigan was finally able to do so with the help of USDA Rural Development. Adam found out about Rural Development’s home loan program from his mother, Mary Kay, who works as a realtor in Pine City, Minnesota. Adam works at a local retail store, and his wages restricted the amount of money available to put toward a house payment. “USDA Rural Development serves a clientele that can really use the assistance,” Mary Kay said.  “Because of Adam’s life challenges and restricted income, he was unsure of whether he would qualify a loan that would fit his budget, but Rural Development has a comprehensive application process and programs suited for people with his income.” After discussing his desire for homeownership with his parents, Adam’s mom and dad purchased an older home that, with some major updates, would be a great match for Adam. They hired some contractors to install new windows, paint the walls, replace sheetrock, and re-wire. Once completed, they came to an agreement with Adam on a purchase price, which is when he applied for a loan through Rural Development. “It’s nice to have something to call my own,” Adam said. “The privacy that goes along with it is also a major benefit. I enjoy having friends over without worrying about bothering the neighbors.” Upon the completion of more upgrades, and an appraisal, Adam was able to purchase his home at a reasonable price, and has a monthly payment he can afford thanks to Rural Development.  Complete with a music room, walls painted in to his liking, and furniture and decorations he picked out, Adam is happy and comfortable knowing he’s investing his money in the equity of his own home.

"USDA Nebraska Public Information Officer in  Rural  Mar 12,  Donald Parkos on porch of his new home, funded in part through USDA. The Norfolk, Nebraska Area Habitat for Humanity (NAHFH) wanted to expand the impact of its home construction program, and get a more immediate return on investment so it could help the greatest number of people in need. USDA Rural Development was the agency NAHFH felt was best met that need. NAHFH utilized a community revitalization grant administered by the Northeast Nebraska Economic Development District (NENEDD), managed by Northeast Economic Development, Inc. (NED, Inc.) to demolish the dilapidated property that previously existed on the lot site.  The new construction was completed through donations of supplies and expertise, sweat equity and primarily through the building trades program at Northeast Community College. USDA Rural Development worked with Donald Parkos, the potential homebuyer, throughout the application process.  USDA Rural Development provided the first mortgage for him to purchase the home.  In addition to this, Parkos received down payment assistance.  Through the hard work of a number of partners, Donald was able to afford a newly built home for less than $100,000.  Today he resides in his 1,100 square foot, two bedroom, one bath home. The partnership had an impact far beyond that of just homeownership. The process helped revitalize a neighborhood by placing a nice, newly built home where a dilapidated structure once stood. It also helped create a sense of community and ownership in the neighborhood by all involved.

"Oregon USDA Public Information Officer in  Rural  Nov 06,  For Martin Paredes and his family (pictured here), Castle Rock Apartments provide good quality rental housing for working families, while serving as a stepping stone to home ownership. Boardman, Oregon, is a port town of just over 3,000 on the banks of the Columbia River surrounded by productive farm lands. These resources have helped the community generate above-average economic growth through its agricultural, food processing, manufacturing, and shipping sectors. As these industries have grown, however, a significant shortage of affordable workforce housing has made finding and keeping skilled employees difficult and hinders further economic development in this promising community. In order to secure affordable housing, many who work in Boardman have had to endure long commutes from outlying towns or settle for homes that simply did not meet their families’ needs. Martin Paredes, Olgalibia Rosales Rivera, and their four children are one such family. Due to a lack of rental options in the community, the family was living in a two-bedroom apartment in a part of town that offered few family-friendly amenities and services. Last month, the Umatilla County Housing Authority and CASA of Oregon opened the doors to Castle Rock Apartments, with 40 brand-new rental units located adjacent to schools, a grocery store, health care, churches, transportation, a safe playground, and more. To develop a quality housing facility with “built to last” standards, a number of federal, state, local and nonprofit partners worked together to identify financing options that included funding and tax credits provided by the State of Oregon and the federal government. USDA Rural Development provided a $2.4 million low-interest loan through the Farm Labor Housing Program, which offers low-interest financing to develop housing for those working in agriculture and food processing. The program also offers a rental subsidy to ensure housing and utility costs do not exceed 30 percent of a household’s income. Today, Martin Paredes and his family live in a new, four-bedroom apartment with plenty of room for the children. In addition, the rent is lower, allowing the family to start saving for the future. “We hope to buy our own home someday,” Paredes said. Another resident, Lisa Garcia Mendez, explains that before the new complex was built, apartments in Boardman were too expensive for farm worker families and, even then, the options were just not good. Moving to Castle Rock has changed things for her family of six. “I just feel safer here with my kids,” Mendez said. To find out more about USDA Rural Development Housing programs click here.

"Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Aug 14,  The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) annual report on the Expenditures on Children by Families has found that a middle-income family with a child born in can expect to spend about $241,080 for food, shelter, and other necessities associated with child rearing expenses over the next 17 years. How much will that little bundle of joy cost? According to USDA’s Cost of Raising a Child report, the answer for a child born in is $241,080 for food, shelter and other necessities over the next 17 years, which translates to about $301,970 when adjusted for inflation! Speaking as a father and a grandfather, I know how much we as parents want to give our children the tools they need to excel at anything they set their minds to—from the essentials, like a roof over their heads and a quality education, to the fun stuff, like a brand new soccer ball, piano lessons or a trip to summer camp. We work hard to ensure our children’s future happiness and success each and every day. But this next generation faces a unique challenge that threatens their future health and well being: a growing health crisis, in the form of diet- and obesity-related diseases. And despite encouraging recent on declining rates of early childhood obesity, nearly a third of our nation's young people are at risk for preventable diseases like type-2 diabetes and heart disease. Preventable diseases have serious consequences – which is why health experts tell us that our current generation of children may well have a shorter lifespan than their parents. In light of this, perhaps the most important leg up we can give to our children is a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and other nutrients they need to grow up healthy and strong. We at USDA have been doing our part by making it a top priority to improve child nutrition and provide science-based nutrition information and advice so that the healthy choice is the easy choice for American parents and children. Thirty two million American students now have healthier and more nutritious school breakfasts, lunches and snacks due to improved nutrition standards implemented as a result of the historic Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of . And parents and teachers can use the resources at ChooseMyPlate.gov to access quick, easy reference tools to facilitate healthy eating on a budget for parents, teachers, healthcare professionals and communities.

"Plant Health Safeguarding Specialist in Port of Honolulu, HI, USDA APHIS PPQ in  Animals  Apr 30,  We inspect all contraband from mail and passenger baggage. Any live insects in the contraband go to the local USDA Plant Inspection Station for identification. Aloha! I am a Plant Health Safeguarding Specialist based in Hawaii, where my colleagues and I help protect agricultural crops and natural resources on the U.S. mainland from plant pests like exotic fruit flies, Asian citrus psyllid and the coconut rhinoceros beetle. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service’s multi-faceted predeparture inspection program supports the movement of travelers, baggage, cargo and mail leaving the Hawaiian Islands, while working to stop the movement of invasive pests. Many do not realize that the mail is an important way invasive pests can move. To find items prohibited from reaching the mainland by this pathway, trained detector dogs spend nights targeting parcels in search of plant material in transit at Honolulu’s main post office. With their keen sense of smell the detector dogs are over 90% accurate at identifying mailed packages containing prohibited items like fruits, flowers and vegetables. In the morning, the packages that the canines identified are processed for a swift, legal inspection on the basis of the dogs’ expertise. One of the items dogs continually alert on are boxes containing prohibited flower leis. Everyone knows the lovely tradition expressing friendship, greetings and love with lei. They are regularly seen at weddings and graduations. To help facilitate the safe movement of the flower lei that nurseries and growers ship daily to the mainland, APHIS has a compliance program specifically for lei made of low risk flowers like orchids and ti leaf. Excluded from this program are lei made from prohibited plant material like berries (a host for invasive fruit flies). Plant Health Safeguarding Specialists don’t just work with detector dogs at the post office. We inspect commodities leaving Hawaii in shipments and we conduct hand inspections of passenger baggage. When inspecting baggage at the airport, any live insects found are turned over to the local USDA Plant Inspection Station for official identification. We rotate into different roles every three months so we’re well-rounded and fully engaged in supporting the APHIS mission. Most of us enter our roles with a background in plant science, entomology or biology. Then we receive intensive, specialized training to prepare us to work with farmers, shippers, travelers and our state and Federal partners. And, because we want to spread the beauty and goodwill of the Hawaiian Islands, I will provide guidance for families mailing lei as mementos to remind distant relatives and friends of home. The proper way to mail an allowable lei is to take it to an APHIS Plant Inspection Station to have the item inspected and sealed in your shipping box at no cost. A USDA label will be affixed to the box and you can take it to a post office to mail knowing it will not be delayed by one of our keen-scented canines. As the Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month draws to a close, one thing we can recognize is that we are all connected through agriculture. We all have a role to play in protecting American agriculture from invasive pests – whether you are a farmer, a shipper, a traveler or you purchase agriculture items over the internet. Every day is a day to be aware of how easy it is to move invasive pests. Please visit this APHIS predeparture page for more information useful to travelers.

"Preclearance Area Director for Europe, Africa and the Middle East in  Animals  Apr 20,  Inspection of Ornithogalum dubium (Star of Bethlehem) in Israel – From left to right, Israeli grower/exporter, Heather Coady, Israeli grower/exporter and Dr. Vedpal Malik, APHIS Senior Treatment and Mitigation Specialist The United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has proclaimed April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. The goal of IPPDAM is to: increase public awareness of invasive species; provide tips to prevent their spread; and, encourage residents to report signs of them. Today we highlight USDA’s Heather Coady. Ms. Coady, and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) employees like her, assist other countries in their pest control efforts by working to stop pests at the source. I’m lucky that my career allows me to mix two of my passions – the travel bug and protecting our country against invasive pests. My passion for travel started 20 years ago when I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Honduras. A few years later, I began learning about invasive pests when I worked on the Asian Longhorned Beetle program. I directly saw the effects that an invasive species has in the environment. As I moved through my career at APHIS, I worked at a Plant Inspection Station, intercepting pests before they entered the U.S. I am currently stationed in the Netherlands as part of our preclearance program. I work to keep pests from being imported, working directly with our National Plant Protection Organization (NPPO) counterparts, growers and exporters. Preclearance is the first line of defense for the U.S. -- addressing pest risks offshore. I manage eight different preclearance programs: in Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, the UK (England and Scotland), Israel, Turkey, Belgium and France. I love that I get to see the plants growing in the field before harvest. I talk with the growers and the NPPO inspectors in person and find out how the season has been, the weather, their challenges – all in real time. If we see a problem, we can help them figure out what to do right now to ensure that their plants will meet APHIS’ standards and can enter the U.S. pest and disease free. Last December, the Royal Dutch Wholesalers Association for Flower Bulbs and Nursery Stock honored APHIS’ contributions to the Dutch flower bulb and plant trade at its annual conference. We created the Dutch flower bulb and perennial preclearance program 66 years ago to help post-World War II recovery efforts. It was the first program of its kind, and it serves as a model for dozens of other agriculture preclearance programs around the world. With this program, Dutch exporters avoid costly delays or rejections at U.S. ports and both countries benefit because plant health issues are dealt with promptly and transparently. Today, the United States is one of the top markets for Dutch flower bulbs and perennials with sales reaching approximately $120 million last year. Trade and travel are making the world smaller, but also increasing the chance of damaging insects and pathogens entering the U.S. April is Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month so this is the perfect time to share the many ways Americans can protect their gardens and landscapes against invasive Hungry Pests. I want to highlight a few simple things everyone can do to keep invasive pests from spreading to new locations. When you travel internationally, declare all agriculture products to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. If you purchase plants online for your garden or home, buy from reputable sources. Avoid using invasive plant species at all costs! Remove them from your garden and don’t share them with other gardeners. Talk to other gardeners about invasives and how you plan to help in the fight against them. If you are worried that your garden will lose its luster after removing invasive plants, talk to your local native plant society or exotic pest plant council. These organizations will be able to suggest suitable replacements. Report any suspected invasive species to your county extension agent or local USDA office. And be sure to check with USDA before mailing or shipping produce, plants, or plant products into the U.S. from another country to find out what’s allowed. Find more about Hungry Pests and How They Spread – and thank you for protecting the things we love.

"Smuggling, Interdiction and Trade Compliance Officer, Internet Team in  Animals  Technology  Apr 24,  A U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialist, with assistance from SITC, inspects a parcel arriving in the United States at an international mail processing facility. (USDA, Erich Glasgow) While we are raising awareness about invasive pests during Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month, I wanted to share a bit about what I do every day to protect agriculture. When you picture someone on the front lines of stopping invasive pests, you probably picture someone outside – in a field or a tree. But I fight invasive pests from a completely different location – my computer. A big way invasive pests can move from one location to another is through unregulated internet sales. We are seeing more and more of these sales, and it’s a real concern. Why? With normal commercial or retail sales, we can use techniques like quarantines and fumigation to make sure that purchased items are pest-free or don’t enter pest-free areas. But many times, sales on the internet do not follow these techniques, opening up the chance for invasive pests to move freely to new areas. My job is to look for these types of sale offers online and stop them. It may not seem exciting, but I enjoy the challenge. Looking for person-to-person sales of prohibited agricultural items on the internet involves a lot of research and investigative work. I use many tools to help me do my job, including open source, government and subscription databases and software that lets me form a “map” of connections to provide a visual of how prohibited items are moving into the country. When I identify a sale of regulated items, I work with the internet company to identify the buyers and sellers, and work to close the pathway by stopping the sale. This can be by removing or amending the listing to include restrictions on where the product may be sent. In many cases, I coordinate with other SITC employees, who physically visit the locations to perform inspections and search for the prohibited item(s). One area where we see growing promotion and sales of agricultural products is on social media. I am spending more time reviewing social media posts to look for previously unidentified pathways for items to enter the U.S. I enjoy my work and I’m proud of the role I play in helping stop illegal internet sales. I never know what my day will look like. Many days, I never leave my computer. Other days, I may give presentations to help others understand the work we do. I’m even the lead author on a white paper on preventing illegal sales through e-commerce. I worked with officials from the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand on that project. In , I received the Employee of the Year award from the Plant Protection and Quarantine leadership for my efforts to protect American agriculture. We are increasing our outreach and education activities to help make sure people understand why buying agricultural items on the internet – especially from foreign countries or individuals instead of companies – can be dangerous. I find many people just aren’t aware that certain products are restricted or banned completely. They just want to purchase something and look for the best deal. Help me raise awareness and protect our agriculture from invasive pests. Be careful when buying agricultural products on the Internet. When in doubt, you can always contact us to find out if an item is allowed, restricted or banned. Together, we can keep harmful invasive species from entering the country through illegal internet sales. United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue has proclaimed April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month (, 518). The goal of IPPDAM is to: increase public awareness of invasive species; provide tips to prevent their spread; and, encourage residents to report signs of them.

"Director, USDA Caribbean Climate Hub, US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico in  Climate  Nov 27,  Cars navigate down a recently cleared road in Puerto Rico where hurricane Maria has downed trees and powerlines. Last September when hurricanes Irma and Maria passed through the Caribbean they caused catastrophic damage to communities and infrastructure affecting homes, businesses, farms and forests across Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In the aftermath of this devastation the two great challenges facing the relief effort are to help bring back basic services and to learn from our experiences so that we are more resilient to future extreme climatic events. Nearly 600 USDA employees live and work in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, representing several USDA agencies. Like most residents, we prepared our homes and workplaces for Hurricane Irma, which hit the Virgin Islands and northeastern Puerto Rico September 8th. Many of us lost power for several days but we were soon back at work assessing damages and gearing up for recovery. However, less than two weeks later, the winds from Hurricane Maria arrived and by the early morning of September 20th the full force of the storm hit St. Croix and Puerto Rico. As the storm passed it left in its path near total defoliation of trees and downed power lines. Coupled with flooding, the loss of communication and electricity has had the most apparent effects. It’s difficult to predict when an extreme event will occur but we can predict and prepare for the consequences. Now, two months after the storms, trees have begun to leaf out, many roads are clear and disaster assessments are underway, but conditions are still difficult. Power, water, communications and other infrastructure have yet to be fully restored, adding to challenges at work and home. The full extent of the storm’s effects on farms, forests and communities are yet to be determined. Local USDA employees, agencies and leadership have been playing an important role in the recovery, by clearing roads and waterways, assisting with needs for power, assessing and assisting with livestock related health issues in the hard hit poultry and dairy sectors, implementing disaster relief programs, and helping communities that surround our facilities. The complexity of the response within and among islands has highlighted the need to work across USDA’s agencies boundaries to deliver services to hard hit communities. The USDA Climate Hubs are designed to share climate related knowledge among USDA agencies and help each agency expand their capacity. As the recovery continues the challenge is to learn about the effects of extreme events on our farms and forests, transportation, communications and energy systems, and on the supporting industries and markets to ensure the delivery of agricultural goods and ecological services. USDA has a great deal of capacity to learn by monitoring incentive and relief programs and through research programs. We can expect more extremes in heat, drought, fire, flooding, and storms. By investing in learning and working across agencies to apply what we know, we can reduce the risks and costs of extreme climatic events, increase our resistance and resilience, and keep important services flowing from our land and water.

"USDA's Commitment to Quality Foods  Across the country, schools are back in session. Here at the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), our inspectors and procurement specialists work hard to make sure that quality, domestically-produced foods are delivered to students and other recipients for our federal food purchasing programs. As students are getting used to their new schedules, we would like to highlight how our own little field trip shed some light on a typical day for some of our employees. A team of AMS employees recently traveled to Knouse Foods, a grower-owned cooperative that supplies apple and cranberry products for federal food purchasing programs. The employees saw first-hand how USDA inspectors help Knouse and other companies verify the quality of their products. As the apple sauce traveled through the facility, USDA inspectors pulled random samples to make sure that they met product quality and condition requirements. All USDA Foods are to be inspected, and in this case, inspectors pulled samples of apple sauce to evaluate traits like its color, flavor, and consistency. As an independent third-party, the inspections help suppliers meet USDA Foods requirements but they also can help them meet requirements from other buyers.

"Economist, Economic Research Service in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 31,   This week my kids headed back to school, and I’ll be busier than last year, having been drafted to be PTA president.  While  getting to know the new parents at our school, I learned that several are interested in improving school meals and exploring the possibility of purchasing locally and starting a school vegetable garden.  Our new principal is interested too.  I myself have something of a brown thumb, but everyone was excited to hear that I work at the Department of Agriculture and had have been studying Farm to School initiatives throughout the country. I have been in close touch with USDA’s Farm to School team that will visit 15 school districts across the country to learn about their Farm to School activities. When our agency, the Economic Research Service (ERS), put together the Food Environment Atlas earlier this year, we included information on which counties had at least one Farm to School program, using from the National Farm to School Network.  The Network maintains the only national base of Farm to School programs.  After the Atlas was released on our website, we received phone calls from programs that hadn’t been included, and this underscored the need to build a complete base of these programs. This month, ERS developed a cooperative agreement with Occidental College, a partner in the National Farm to School Network, to address the lack of on Farm to School efforts.  Anupama Joshi, who co-chairs the Network, will be leading a census survey in every state, contacting school food authorities with Farm to School initiatives.  Our goal is to identify every school district with Farm to School activities, including school gardens, and ask them about what type of activities they conduct, how many farmers they work with, and how many schools in the district participate. Many of our colleagues are eager to gather even more detailed .  How much are the schools purchasing locally?  What prices are they paying?  How much do school gardens contribute to the meals?  Many community groups would like to have objective research on the benefits of such activities to persuade local governments to support their efforts.  Once we have a comprehensive base, our agency and other researchers will be able to use the list to draw representative samples of participating districts to examine a range of more detailed characteristics and results of the programs. As the new school year approaches, I’m looking forward to a good year at our school, and to learning more about Farm to School programs across the country.

"Sociologist, Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Feb 17,  The Midland County Courthouse in Midland, MI was built in . USDA/ERS photo by Calvin L. Beale. As the Economic Research Service celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year and looks back over the decades, the legacy of Senior Demographer Calvin Beale stands out due to the 55-plus-year length of his service at USDA and the impact of his work. One landmark contribution was Mr. Beale’s discovery of the U.S. nonmetro population turnaround in the early s. His study was first to report that the decades-long stream of rural-to-urban migration had reversed. In Mr. Beale’s obituary in September , The Washington Post extolled his encyclopedic knowledge: “Two or three times a year, Calvin L. Beale would leave his desk in Washington and travel to the University of Wisconsin to speak to graduate students. A professor of rural sociology at the university, Glenn Fuguitt, knew that Mr. Beale had spent decades studying the population trends of rural regions for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and that no one alive had a deeper understanding of his subject. “After his lecture, Mr. Beale would join Fuguitt and the grad students for dinner. In his characteristically reserved but attentive way, he asked the students where they were from. He would then recite the name of each student's county, no matter how remote, and detail its primary businesses and cultural history. As a final flourish, he would describe the local courthouse.” Having once said, “You can’t know what’s going on in the country from behind a desk in Washington,” Calvin visited most U.S. counties. Along the way, he photographed over 2,000 county courthouses. Eighteen of his favorite photos can be viewed in a USDA Flickr gallery.

"Closing the Gap on Food Safety   From small, family farms to large food production companies, food safety is a top priority for the folks who feed our nation and put food on tables around the globe. Participating in programs like USDA’s Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), is one way that farmers and producers of all sizes can demonstrate to buyers that they are adhering to industry food safety standards.  By making this program more accessible to businesses of all sizes, USDA is creating opportunities for our nation’s small and mid-sized farmers.  Last week I traveled to Atlanta, Ga., for the Produce Marketing Association (PMA) Fresh Summit to discuss the expansion of our GroupGAP Program this coming spring. The program is an expansion of our Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) Audit Program, which provides third-party certification services to verify that operations are following industry-recognized food safety practices as well as recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The pilot was supported by funding and technical expertise from the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and the Wallace Center at Winrock International.

"Economic Research Service in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 19,   About this time last year, the city of Washington, DC was digging out from a record amount of snow.  My colleagues at USDA’s Economic Research Service were communicating electronically to get a new web-based mapping tool – the Food Environment Atlas – up and running. This online tool, which measures a community’s food-choice landscape, was to play a key role in the launch of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let's Move! campaign against childhood obesity. The Food Environment Atlas dovetailed neatly with the obesity initiative: the Atlas allows users to compare the food environment among U.S. counties—the mix of factors that together influence food choices, diet quality, and general fitness among residents. The media took notice, and in that first year the Atlas website received over 100,000 visits – becoming one of the most popular of USDA’s products. Today we’re unveiling an update of the Atlas. It now pulls together 168 indicators of the food environment (up from the original 90), measuring factors like availability and type of restaurants and food stores, food prices, socioeconomic characteristics, and health outcomes. We’ve added items that measure change over time, and several indicators that will make the Atlas more useful in gauging residents’ food accessibility in rural communities. The updated Atlas provides on the number and percentage of a county’s households that are low income or that do not own a car, and that also live more than 10 miles from a grocery store. For rural areas, this a more realistic measure of food access than the one-mile measure in the original Atlas. The snowstorm that coincided with last year’s debut of the Food Atlas, with power outages, impassable streets, and the consequent interruption of easy access to food stores and establishment, underscored the importance of the food environment to the options that can make the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets. For some households, limited options are a daily reality, not just a weather-related inconvenience. With the Atlas, researchers, policymakers, media, and other users can create maps and visualize how counties are faring in providing healthful food environments. For any one county, they can obtain on any or all of the 168 indicators. We hope that the Atlas will continue to stimulate research and provide a resource for policymakers as they address the connection between the food environment and the health of communities.

Still, it’s difficult to conceptualize the real impact of free trade agreements until you talk to the people who have directly benefitted from them. In April, I had the pleasure of meeting with a group of winegrowers from Oregon – among them Tom Gerrie, president of Cristom Vineyards in Salem, who was kind enough to share with me his personal experience in exporting. Cristom Vineyards is a family-run craft winery producing around 15,000 cases of wine per year. Founded in by Gerrie’s father, Paul, the company decided that in order to build global brand recognition of Oregon’s fine wines, it would need to target high-end restaurants both in the United States and abroad. In , it shipped its first cases to New York, Chicago, London and Tokyo. Since then, Cristom Vineyards has expanded its exports to 48 states and 18 countries, including South Korea. More than 15 percent of Cristom’s total sales now come from exports.

"USDA Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 04,   The White House on June 2 convened a national forum to seek action on the problem of anti-microbial resistance. The development of antibiotics was one of the most significant medical achievements of the last century, and has helped to save millions of lives. But their overuse or misuse has resulted in the rise of bacteria strains that are resistant to antibiotics. The White House has unveiled a National Action Plan designed to advance the appropriate use of antibiotics in food animals as well as promote collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health. This is consistent with a “One Health” approach that embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. USDA, which helped develop the National Action Plan, was pleased to join our many Federal partners and continue our work with the agriculture industry at the forum. USDA continues to research alternatives to antibiotics, including vaccines, to reduce the use of medically important antibiotics and develop new tools to prevent and treat diseases that impact the health, welfare, and production of livestock, poultry and fish. For example, recent findings by USDA Agricultural Research Service scientists suggest that lysozyme, an enzyme used in many foods and beverages can serve as a natural alternative to antibiotics used to improve feed efficiency and growth in pigs. And through our shared goal, USDA will continue working with the agriculture industry to optimize stewardship of antibiotics in food animals.   In addition, collaborations among partners in medicine, veterinary medicine, and public health are being promoted to support a one health approach to the issue of antimicrobial resistance.   There are a number of entities in the agriculture sector that are trying to address antibiotic stewardship. Specifically, Food producers and retailers are taking actions such as voluntarily phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion, providing responsible use to suppliers from whom they purchase meat, and funding research for alternative management practices that reduce the need for antibiotics.  Some store owners are committing to purchase from suppliers who already have or are phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics or that can provide them with antibiotic-free meat and poultry.  Animal pharmaceutical companies are committed to align their medically important antibiotic products with FDA’s guidance, including removing growth promotion uses and changing marketing status to require veterinary oversight of product use.  Further, the companies investing in vaccines, best management practices, on-farm hygiene, and proper nutritional innovations that will benefit animal health while lessening the reliance on traditional antibiotics. Animal feed industry organizations and livestock and poultry farmers are educating producers and ranchers about the FDA labeling changes that will bring all feed uses of medically important antibiotics under the oversight of licensed veterinarians.  These educational campaigns are helping to make farmers aware of antimicrobial stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antimicrobial use and policy. Livestock and poultry farmers are conducting education and outreach campaigns to make farmers aware of antibiotic stewardship programs and keeping them updated on best practices for antibiotic use and policy. Veterinary, animal agriculture, and meat associations are developing and updating species-specific judicious use , conducting education campaigns on judicious use, and encouraging collection efforts. The organizations are committed to magnifying education outreach efforts through their vast networks by distributing educational material, holding symposiums to bring those in public health and agriculture together, and conducting regional workshops on new antibiotic use and veterinary oversight policies. And, general agriculture, food system non-government organizations are conducting education and outreach and developing standards with an accompanying verification program for the judicious use of medically important antibiotics in food producing animals.  Through this multidisciplinary approach, USDA’s objective remains to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society.

"USDA Office of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Nov 20,  General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin speaks at a press conference announcing the completion of the first-of-its kind purchase of verified carbon credits generated on working ranch lands by Chevrolet, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Nov. 17, . (L to R Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin, Ducks Unlimited Paul Schmidt, The Climate Trust Executive Director Sean Penrith, and USDA Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Robert Bonnie). USDA photo by Tom Witham. Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales. This is how the credit system works: Landowners voluntarily place lands under a perpetual easement but retain rights to work the land, such as raising livestock and growing hay. The carbon storage benefits of this avoided conversion of grasslands are quantified, verified, and formally registered resulting in carbon credits. The carbon credits are made available to entities interested in purchasing carbon offsets. Chevrolet's purchase was undertaken voluntarily as part of its commitment to reduce eight million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. This is comparable to the annual carbon reduction benefit of a mature forest the size of Yellowstone National Park. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded $161,000 through a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) to Ducks Unlimited in to develop the necessary methodology to quantify the carbon stored in the soil by avoiding grassland conversions, resulting in the generation of carbon credits. Besides the landowners, USDA, and Ducks Unlimited, other key partners that helped make this project a success include The Climate Trust, American Carbon Registry, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Terra Global Capital. Public-private partnerships to enhance U.S. carbon sinks such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal areas, are a key part of the Obama Administration’s recently released Climate and Natural Resources Priority Agenda.

"VegU Coordinator, USDA Farmers Market Season in  Farming  Mar 06,  The VegU featured item is always the key ingredient in the ""VegU-cation"" lesson. This special event creates opportunities for customers to ask questions. With more knowledge, customers are willing to purchase the new fruit or vegetable; ultimately resulting in more sales for market vendors. USDA Photo by Preston Keres. Everyday USDA works to develop tools for farmers and ranchers that support their financial success. The USDA Farmers Market on the National Mall is a “living laboratory” for farmers market operations across the country. During our market season, we tested “VegU-cation” and found that this fruit and vegetable education program was popular with our visitors and increased sales for our farmers. Visitors to our market attended a 10-minute demonstration class in the VegU tent, on how to grow, pick, and prepare that week’s featured fruit or vegetable. Here are five tips to help you bring “VegU-cation” to your market: 1. Use Simple and Creative Recipes – Customers are more likely to consider making a recipe, using the featured item, if it has just a few ingredients that are easy to assemble. Keep the preparation demo to five minutes or less. Highlighting new ways to prepare an item that shoppers may have never considered, like roasted avocado instead of guacamole, works great. Add a toppings bar to a simple recipe to make it more interactive. During a demo last year, VegU featured mangos, with a toppings bar of lime hot sauce, salt and pepper, cumin, and cayenne pepper. This extra feature gave participants a chance to try some of the many ways a mango can be enjoyed. 2. Showcase Variety to Create Interest - Offering variety increases customers’ willingness to try new foods and can make a farmers booth vibrant and inviting. We spotlighted lesser-known varieties of apples and pears, grown by our farmers, during a VegU session. The presentation included “fun facts” along with the variety names, distinguishing characteristics and suggestions on the best varieties for snacking, baking and salads. A similar display for mushrooms listing names, flavor and texture profiles, as well as preparation suggestions, worked really well. 3. Provide Free Samples - Free food gets attention! We have found that serving samples halfway through the demo keeps folks interested. Once they taste it, they often want to buy the featured item and try the recipe. Talking about nutritional value and asking participants to share their favorite recipes also helps to engage your audience. 4. Share How Things Grow - We found that displaying and talking about live plants, grown in the USDA greenhouse or brought in from nearby nurseries and farms, encourages customers to taste and purchase unfamiliar vegetables, like okra. VegU helps shoppers improve their knowledge about seasonal availability of fruits and vegetables and learn more how the foods they love are grown. 5. Don’t Be Afraid of Challenges – For farmers, growing an unfamiliar product can be challenging in an unknown market. However, VegU presentations on new or unusual items can create a great deal of interest amongst shoppers. We have found that shoppers are interested in learning about these out-of-the-ordinary items like how to prepare kohlrabi or fennel. VegU often resulted in vendors selling more of the featured vegetable or fruit – sometimes selling out! Activities like our ""Guess the Mystery Vegetable"" game engage audiences and encourages them to try new things. VegU is just one example of a special event to build market support for farmers. We also asked farmers market managers across the country to share what helped make their markets better. Many told us that hosting special events, offering community programs, and other activities added to their success. Checkout our Farmers Market Improvement Toolkit for more ideas. If you are in our Nation’s capital, please join us at the USDA Farmers Market and stop by the VegU tent.

"USDA Agricultural Marketing Service, Deanna Gierszewski, North Dakota Department of Agriculture and Josh Johnson, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in  Research and Science  Aug 14,   Advances in technology, automation, and remote sensing is a cross-cutting, macro movement in science impacting agriculture outlined in the USDA Science Blueprint (, 2.6 ). The Science Blueprint guides USDA’s science priorities for the next 5 years, building from past success. Relative to other crops, many specialty crops are more dependent on agricultural labor for production, harvesting, and processing. This is part of a blog series that highlights research investments to advance automation and mechanization for specialty crops. U.S. specialty crop producers face a variety of challenges that require a diverse set of solutions. From labor shortages and rising production costs that threatened the health of Florida’s strawberry industry to water supply challenges that stymied North Dakota’s vegetable yields, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program (SCBGP) has helped producers bring to life innovative ideas in automation. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service provides annual SCBGP funding to State Departments of Agriculture for projects that support specialty crop growers, producers and consumers. The projects can range from outreach and education, training, marketing or research to enhance the specialty crop industry. Each State determines priorities that will be most impactful to the issues they are facing. The tool is designed to mimic human hands and fingers as it picks strawberries. Photo Credit: Shinsuke Agehara In the case of addressing labor shortfalls in strawberry harvesting, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services awarded funding to the University of Central Florida to develop a project that is currently engineering a mechanical arm. This gripper will mimic human hands and fingers as it picks strawberries—without damaging the fruit. The technology aims to be universal for different strawberry varieties. The project will also evaluate the economic impact of the gripper creation. To date, the project team finalized their design and manufactured two prototypes. Both prototypes have gone through laboratory and field tests, and one has been integrated with a robotic arm-like platform for harvesting. The team will measure project success by the number of strawberry varieties to which the picking mechanism can be applied and the number of harvesting platforms that decide to adopt the technology. In North Dakota, the State Department of Agriculture distributed SCBGP funds to North Dakota State University to tackle water management issues. The project’s goal is to improve fruit and vegetable yields by creating a drip irrigation system that can be automatically controlled by soil moisture sensors. The project involves conducting experiments to see how different mulch types and amounts impact weed control with the system. They will then educate local growers on the new drip irrigation technology. Drip irrigation system projected to conserve water, improve soil temperature, and extend growing seasons for North Dakota fruit and vegetable production. Photo Credit: Xinhua Jia To date, the team has designed, built and implemented the drip irrigation system and conducted comparisons on tomato and watermelon yield and quality. With its projected ability to conserve water, improve soil temperature and extend growing seasons, the team sees this system as the future of North Dakota specialty crops. Automated production methods have been a common thread in multiple SCBGP projects. According to the recent ERS Report, Developing Automation and Mechanization for Specialty Crops: A Review of U.S. Department of Agriculture Programs, $12.5 million in funding on automation and mechanization projects has been distributed in the SCBGP between -. As states and growers identify specific needs in the specialty crop industry, SCBGP welcomes innovative ideas to help the industries evolve and adapt.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 15,  42% of districts surveyed by USDA say they participate in farm to school activities. March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  We’ve talked quite a bit in the past about the major benefits we’re seeing in schools and districts that have established a farm to school program.  Their efforts are giving students a deep understanding and appreciation for where their food comes from and drastically shifting kids’ opinions of fruits and veggies. The final results of the USDA Farm to School Census shed light on another huge benefit of farm to school – we’re talking $789 million huge.  That’s the total amount schools report investing in their communities in school year – by purchasing local food from farmers, ranchers, fisherman, food processors, and manufacturers.  This represents a 105 percent increase over school year – , when the first USDA Farm to School Census was conducted.  In addition, nearly half of districts engaged in farm to school report that they plan to purchase more local foods in the coming years. These funds are a major boost to local communities, helping sustain local food systems by providing a consistent, reliable customer base.  With farm to school, “you have a customer, an able buyer willing to pay fair market price and buy in bulk,” explained Chuck McCool of McCool Farms in Arkansas.  As Chuck puts it, “Farm to school is the greatest thing that’s happened to vegetable farmers since… well since I can’t remember when!  I can’t remember what would have been better than farm to school… It’s a win-win for everybody.” But the benefits aren’t just limited to vegetable farmers; farm to school programs present economic opportunities for the whole agricultural industry. Fruits, vegetables and milk top the list of foods schools are most likely to buy locally, but schools indicate that they’d like to also buy more plant-based proteins, grains, meats, poultry and eggs from local suppliers in the future.  And these types of programs aren’t only seen in states known for their agriculture like Iowa or Nebraska.  The Census results show that farm to school programs are present in every state across the country, in schools large and small, rural and urban. We’ve recognized a few of these programs on our Farm to School Census page, highlighting three programs per state that are beating their state’s average spending on local foods.  But we know there are many more schools out there that are doing innovative work through their farm to school programs.  That’s why we’re inviting you to vote for the farm to school program that you think is ‘One in a Melon!’  Now through April 15 you can nominate a school that you believe has an exemplary farm to school program.  So check out the extended results of the Farm to School Census and cast your vote today!  Winners will be announced this May.

"First-ever Regional Farm to School Institute Underway in the Northeast This account was written by VT FEED Project Director, Betsy Rosenbluth and Shelburne Farms Public Relations and Marketing Director, Vera Chang.   As principal of Sharon Elementary School in Sharon, Vt., Barrett Williams helps his teachers integrate farm to school pedagogy into curricula by making sure they have planning time during the school day and a stipend to compensate their efforts. Time and resources are limited for teachers who are under rigorous demands to meet school standards. So Williams must be creative to ensure food, farming, nutrition, and place-based learning are part of students’ education. We’re listening to Williams and his peers talk at a round-table workshop that is part of the pioneering, year-long Northeast Farm to School Institute. Williams is one of 90 school administrators, teachers, food service professionals, and community members at the Institute’s kick-off, held on Shelburne Farms’ 1,400-acre campus in northern Vermont.

"Change Beyond the Plate  The following guest blog from a school and community nutrition services director in Louisville, Kentucky highlights how non-profit School Food FOCUS relies on USDA’s Process Verified Program (PVP) to help increase transparency and choice for school food purchases.  USDA’s objective, third-party auditing services focus on increasing transparency from farm to market by offering verification based on clearly defined, implemented, and transparent process points. Director of School and Community Nutrition Services, Jefferson County Public Schools, Louisville, Kentucky The first time School Food FOCUS brought together a group of school food directors like myself to talk about how we could improve the quality of chicken—the number one protein we serve to students—I was thrilled and a little daunted. Schools across the country spend nearly $1 billion on chicken every year. That’s a lot of buying power. School Food FOCUS challenged us to think about the changes we can make to our food system if districts leveraged this buying power to create a demand for chicken that is better on the plate and for the environment.  Shayla Bailey, AMS Public Affairs  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 05,   Respond to this story",How can school districts leverage their collective buying power to create demand for more sustainable and nutritious chicken options?,"School districts can leverage their collective buying power by working with organizations like School Food FOCUS to negotiate with suppliers, promote transparent and verified processes (such as USDA's Process Verified Program), and collectively demanding higher standards for sustainability and nutrition in the chicken they purchase."
"Acting Deputy Administrator, AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 03,  The Quality Monitoring Program will verify the quality and purity of extra virgin and organic extra virgin olive oil. The program will help consumers know that the products they are buying will meet their expectations. Photo courtesy of Pompeian, Inc.  There have been a lot of questions over the last few years about the quality and purity of olive oil.  USDA has expanded our Quality Monitoring Program to include extra virgin and organic extra virgin olive oil.  This program already evaluates a variety of commodities including canned, frozen and certain fresh fruits and vegetables. With many Americans looking for alternatives and additions at meal time, the popularity of olive oil has been on the rise.  Consumers looking for the qualities and signature flavor of olive oil want to know that the products they buy will meet their expectations. As part of the Quality Monitoring Program for olive oil, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) lab verifies olive oil quality and purity using criteria based on the U.S. grade standards for olive oil and international criteria.  Our assessment also includes unannounced plant visits to review production processes, quality assurance measures, and recordkeeping systems. Pompeian, Inc.—headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland—is the first manufacturer to participate in USDA’s Quality Monitoring Program for olive oil.  Their operation qualified by meeting our rigorous review and evaluation process and their product met chemical testing and flavor analysis requirements.  AMS will conduct ongoing, unannounced plant visits to verify that Pompeian continues to meet the Quality Monitoring Program for olive oil requirements. AMS will apply these same measures for all firms who wish to participate in Quality Monitoring Program for olive oil.  Visit our website to learn more about the Quality Monitoring Program.

"Celebrating the New Face of Agriculture  At the Agricultural Marketing Service and across USDA, we often talk about the fact that the face of American agriculture is changing. The ranks of our farmers, especially young and beginning farmers, include a growing number of women, people of color, veterans or folks in their second careers. So-called “traditional” agriculture defies the term as it pursues new strategies, new products, and new markets. Across the country, agriculture is diversifying and evolving to meet changing consumer demands. I saw the new face of agriculture last week during travels to Illinois and Indiana. My first stop was a roundtable on Women in Agriculture held at FarmedHere in Bedford Park, Illinois, about 15 miles from Chicago. Twenty or so women gathered to talk about their farming goals and to hear about how USDA could support them. This topic is close to my heart – I’m a New Hampshire native, a state with the second highest percentage of women farmers in the country. The women around the table with me represented the new face of ag, but so too did the setting – an indoor, vertical farm that produces basil and microgreens in a facility designed to reduce energy costs and shrink the carbon footprint of growing food.  FarmedHere is managed by Megan Klein, an attorney by training who found her calling in urban agriculture and became part of this “new face.”  Elanor Starmer, AMS Administrator  Posted in  Conservation  Initiatives  Apr 13,   4 Responses","What innovative farming practices are being employed by FarmedHere, an indoor microgreens facility, to reduce energy costs and shrink its carbon footprint?","FarmedHere uses a facility designed to reduce energy costs and shrink the carbon footprint of growing food through its indoor, vertical farm setup."

"Public Affairs Specialist and Maribel Alonso, Technical Information Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Aug 18,  Always follow food safety steps when preparing lunches at home. Photo courtesy of FSIS With the - school year approaching, many parents are preparing for changes to their routine. Many students may be returning to school for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began and others may be distance learning. Don’t let foodborne illness – commonly called food poisoning – keep your child from learning. Take the time to plan and prepare your children’s lunch meals safely. While children rely on teachers for daily lessons, the task of making safe lunches falls squarely on caregivers. Unlike cafeteria workers who take food safety trainings on a regular basis, most parents preparing lunch for their kids at home, or to take to school, haven’t received any formal food safety instruction. Nutrition counts, too. The lunch you’re making not only satisfies hunger pangs of busy kids, it fuels their cognitive abilities. Studies have shown that proper nutrition improves students’ scores, memory capacities, motor skills, social skills, and language skills. Keep them well fed and safe with the four steps to steps to food safety – Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill. Clean: The best way to prevent many forms of illness, including foodborne illness, is with proper hand washing. Children should always clean their hands before eating, and parents should do so before and during lunch preparation. It’s easy to get preoccupied by busy schedules and rush through the five steps of washing hands; however, handwashing is vital to remove any germs that may be present. Hand washing should always include the following:  Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold), turn off the tap and apply soap.  Lather your hands by rubbing them together with the soap. Be sure to lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.  Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the “Happy Birthday” song from beginning to end twice.  Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.  Dry your hands using a clean towel. Separate: Prevent cross-contamination by keeping raw meat and poultry away from ready-to-eat foods. When preparing perishable foods that require cutting (for example, raw bacon and raw chicken you plan to cook for salad), make sure you separate these items from fruits, vegetables, cheeses and other foods to avoid cross-contamination.  Cut up and prepare your raw ingredients ahead of time to avoid cross-contamination as you handle your ready-to-eat items for salads or other sides.  Different colored cutting boards are a great reminder to prevent cross-contamination (you can use a green cutting board for fresh produce and another color for meat and poultry). Cook: Have a food thermometer easily accessible to ensure you’re cooking to recommended safe internal temperatures:  Cook whole cuts of meat, including beef and pork to 145 degrees Fahrenheit and allow them to rest for at least 3 minutes before carving.  Cook ground meats, like burgers and sausages, to 160 degrees Fahrenheit.  Cook all chicken and turkey to 165 degrees Fahrenheit. Chill: When preparing lunch ahead of time, remember perishable foods should not enter the Danger Zone – temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit – where bacteria multiply quickly and can make food unsafe.  Make sure all perishable items are refrigerated within two hours of coming out of the oven or refrigerator.  Discard food that has been left out for more than two hours to prevent foodborne illness.  If your child needs to carry their lunch themselves, never pack perishable foods in a brown paper bag because they will be unsafe by lunchtime. Use an insulated, soft-sided lunch bag and add a frozen gel pack and a frozen juice box or bottle of water with the lunch. These four steps – Clean, Separate, Cook and Chill – give parents and caregivers steps they can use to protect their children from food poisoning. Now that we’ve covered all the basics, you’re ready for the big test – hungry students! Consumers can learn more about key food safety practices at Foodsafety.gov, by following @USDAFoodSafety on Twitter and by liking Facebook.com/FoodSafety.gov. Consumers with questions about food safety can call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, in English or Spanish, or email to mphotline@usda.gov.

"Celebrate the Chinese New Year While Being Citrus Smart  Out with the snake, in with horse! January 31 marks the start of the Chinese New Year. Many people will be enjoying the rich cultural traditions of this holiday such as food, parades and exchanging gifts. One traditional Chinese New Year gift is citrus fruit, such as mandarin oranges and tangerines. This fruit is said to bring luck, wealth and prosperity. However, without proper precautions citrus can also bring something else that may not be so favorable—the Asian citrus psyllid. This pest carries citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), a disease threatening the commercial citrus industry and homegrown citrus trees alike. Although it is not harmful to humans or animals, the disease is fatal for citrus trees and has no known cure.

"Foreign Service Trainee & Andre Bradley, International Climate Hub Coordinator, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Climate  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Technology  Apr 22,  As the U.S. Department of Agriculture celebrates Earth Day with communities across the nation and around the globe, we have an exciting opportunity to highlight the activities, tools and resources of the USDA International Climate Hub. Secretary Vilsack announced the creation of the International Climate Hub in at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Egypt, demonstrating the Administration’s commitment to helping farmers, foresters and other land managers worldwide to mitigate the causes of climate change, adapt to the changing climate and ensure global food security. The International Climate Hub provides a platform that enables agricultural communities worldwide to share research, tools, collaborative efforts and best practices. It builds on the success of USDA’s domestic climate hubs, which serve as the premier model for developing and delivering science-based, region-specific information and technologies to help land managers reduce risk, build resilience and enable climate-informed decision making. Today, under the banner of Sustainably Cultivating the Future, the International Climate Hub will join various USDA agencies, the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation and other partners for an Earth Day celebration on the National Mall from 11 a.m.- 3 p.m. Visitors will have the opportunity to view informational exhibits, attend discussions and participate in hands-on workshops and teaching moments in the USDA People’s Garden. At the event, the International Climate Hub will shine a spotlight on the cross-border benefits of applied agroforestry best practices. Globally, agroforestry best practices integrate the cultivation and conservation of trees and shrubs into cropping or livestock systems, helping sequester carbon, combat soil erosion, provide habitat for wildlife and pollinators, improve water quality, and diversify farms and ranches. ""Trees have often been taken for granted in the Northeast, but now they stand out as one of the best ways to both adapt to climate impacts and mitigate greenhouse gases,"" says Suzy Hodgson, Sustainable Agriculture Outreach Specialist with the University of Vermont Extension, and the USDA Northeast Climate Hub. ""Trees offer relief from the impacts of climate change we're experiencing in the Northeast while also sequestering and storing carbon above and below ground. Agroforestry practices yield multiple benefits to farmers. We are looking at trees in a new light and intentionally blurring the boundaries between forestry and agriculture for mutual benefit."" Through a partnership with Colorado State University, the International Climate Hub is helping global farmers visualize the impact of agroforestry on carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions through the COMET Planner Global Tool. A recent update of the tool allows agricultural producers to better explore the potential benefits of agroforestry. If you’re in Washington, D.C., today, pop on over to the National Mall and help us celebrate Earth Day and climate-smart agroforestry!

"Under Secretary, Marketing & Regulatory Programs, USDA in  Farming  Organic  May 21,  Organic is a growing sector, with domestic sales of organic products topping $69.7 billion in . However, consumer research shows that consumers do not always understand what “organic” means and how USDA protects the organic label. Now retailers and brands can download a toolkit of signs and messages about the requirements for different types of organic products that can be used in stores or online to help consumers learn more about the USDA Organic seal. The National Organic Program (NOP) created the resource to highlight the four pillars of what it means to be organic: Protected by law:  USDA develops standards for organic products.  The USDA can enforce criminal penalties against operations that falsely use the organic seal.  NOP investigates complaints and takes action against businesses that violate the regulations. Inspected by experts:  Specially trained organic inspectors visit farms yearly to confirm they still meet the organic standards. Every organic operation is also subject to additional inspections and testing.  Operations must go through a rigorous process before they can use the organic label. Traced from farm to store:  The Strengthening Organic Enforcement rule increases the USDA’s ability to audit the entire organic supply chain to deter, detect, and stop fraud before it reaches stores.  Farms and businesses must keep detailed records of the organic products they produce, buy, and sell. This allows businesses to choose trusted suppliers and verify that what they sell is organic. Shaped by public input:  Stakeholders provide feedback on proposed regulations to shape final policies.  The organic standards are developed with recommendations from an advisory board – the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB).  The public can attend bi-annual NOSB public meetings and provide input. The full toolkit, along with the individual graphics, is available on the AMS website. Many graphics include a QR code that links to the Understanding the Organic Basics webpage, where consumers can learn more about the NOP and the organic label. NOP is a federal regulatory program that develops and enforces consistent national standards for organically produced agricultural products sold in the United States.

"The People's Garden Apiary, installed in , is located on the roof of the Jamie L. Whitten Building and has homed up to approximately 80,000 Italian honey bees. USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Bee Research Lab in Beltsville, Maryland, helps keep these colonies of bees strong and healthy so they can pollinate crops growing in the People's Garden and neighboring landscapes. They also produce delicious honey! Beehives are often important elements of urban gardens due to the pollination services they provide. They’re also big business. Honeybees pollinate $ates each year, including more than 130 types of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Honeybees also produce honey, worth about $3.2 million in according to USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). How are hives constructed? The beehives are wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other. Each box (or super) holds 8-10 wooden frames which include a thin sheet of wax foundation in each frame. The bees build their combs on these foundations. How is honey extracted? Honey is stored in the combs in the upper parts of the hive. When the bees have filled the combs in the upper section with honey and covered them with wax caps, the beekeeper takes them away to extract the honey. Are honey bees native to the United States? Honey bees are not native to the United States. The scientific name for honey bee is Apis mellifera. Since humans first began keeping honey bees, their principal aim has been the harvest of honey. Beekeepers select the appropriate type of honey bee based on temperament, physical characteristics, disease resistance, and productivity. Italian honey bees were selected for the People's Garden Apiary because they are most often used in commercial beekeeping in the United States. These bees have a relatively gentle disposition and are good honey producers. They are not the most resistant to disease, but they excel in most other areas. There have been some queen survivorship issues in both of the People's Garden colonies, which actually mirrors what's going on in the rest of the country. Queen health is an issue for everyone who buys queens, commercial or hobbyist. The exact underlying reasons for poor queen survivorship is unknown, but the ARS lab is actively researching this problem.","What are some common characteristics of constructed beehives used in commercial beekeeping, and how do they facilitate honey production and harvesting?","In commercial beekeeping, beehives are typically wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other, with 8-10 wooden frames per super, containing a thin sheet of wax foundation. This design allows bees to build combs for honey storage in the upper parts of the hive, which can then be extracted by the beekeeper when the combs are filled and capped with wax."

"It's ideal to have host plants and nectar plants growing in your garden if your goal is to attract butterflies. Selecting what to plant varies enormously based on what butterfly species you wish to attract. Butterflies will roam in search of food and egg-laying sites for many miles—even hundreds to thousands—of miles. Butterflies lay their eggs on host plants that the emerging caterpillars will eat. Different species of butterflies prefer different types of plants to lay their eggs on. Milkweed and Monarch Butterflies The monarch butterfly however is very specific and only lays her eggs on species of Asclepias - commonly known as milkweed. Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies migrate from the United States and Canada to overwintering areas in Mexico and California and make the return flight in spring. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat, are having a devastating impact on monarch populations. By planting milkweed you can help save the monarch butterfly.","What is the primary host plant that Monarch Butterfly caterpillars eat, and why is it crucial to have this plant in your garden to support their life cycle?","The primary host plant for Monarch Butterfly caterpillars is milkweed (Asclepias), which is crucial to have in your garden as the caterpillars will only eat this specific type of plant, making it essential for supporting their life cycle."

"Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Nutrition Security  Apr 25,  Setting kids up for success. It’s what every parent, guardian, and educator wants for our nation’s schoolchildren. They understand the power that small changes have to make a big difference in the learning environment. That’s why here at USDA, we recently announced a generational investment in our children’s futures through updated school nutrition standards. Right now, schools across our country are serving breakfasts and lunches to nearly 30 million children every day. Healthy school meals that represent the main source of nutrition for more than half of these students and are an essential part of the educational landscape — like teachers, books, or computers – helping to unlock kids’ full potential in and out of the classroom. It is no surprise that poor nutrition and diet-related diseases are correlated with lower academic achievement, worse health outcomes, and more behavioral problems for kids. We recognize the tremendous work that educators and school nutrition professionals do every day to ensure our children are fueled to thrive. Healthy school meals are an essential element of a quality education and are a part of the solution to promote children’s health. We know that this work is not easy, which is why the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments to help schools provide healthy and nutritious meals to students. School breakfast offers the jump start to a great day. It sets the tone for the rest of the day, especially for children. It’s why kids who eat breakfast have increased alertness and improved moods throughout the morning, fostering a better learning experience. What’s more, studies find that students who participate in school meal programs consume more whole grains, milk, fruits, and vegetables during mealtimes and enjoy better overall diet quality. These pivotal updates we are making to school nutrition standards have been shaped by a host of stakeholders, including parents, devoted teachers, school administrators, school nutrition directors, and industry leaders, and are informed by the latest Dietary for Americans. These new standards allow us to take the next step in putting kids’ health at the forefront by:  Reducing the amounts of added sugars in school meals, especially at breakfast.  Making it easier to offer healthy proteins at breakfast.  Scaling back sodium levels over time.  Continuing to emphasize fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains, to give kids the right balance of nutrients for healthy, tasty meals. That’s not all. We are also providing flexibilities to make it easier for schools to accommodate vegetarian diets and the cultural and religious food preferences of students. This way, every child has access to the nutritious foods they desire and deserve to nourish their bodies and minds. We encourage educators to uplift these school meal enhancements as an opportunity to maximize the impact of what they do best – educate. Because it’s that commitment to inspire that enables all students to thrive. For that important gift, our nation couldn’t be more grateful.

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance. Fall is widely considered the best time of year to plant native trees, shrubs, grasses, vines and perennials.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Apr 10,  For many American farms, the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree. The Robison and Stennes family orchards combined equal more than 200 years of growing apples in Washington. The Robison family has been growing apples in Chelan, Washington since the s. Today, Jake – the fourth generation of the Robison family – lives on the early-19th century plot that was used to grow some of the earliest apples to be harvested in Washington. “It’s fascinating that the land we are farming today has been used for apples since nearly the beginning of apple farming in the state of Washington – a unique piece of history,” said Jake Robison. The Stennes family has been growing apples in Pateros, Washington, for more than 130 years, and it continues to modernize its planting, crop management, and harvesting practices. “We’re using self-propelled worker platforms for more efficient work, using robotic harvesting prototypes. Plus, we just purchased our first electric and fully autonomous tractors,” Mark Stennes told FAS. Furthermore, the Stennes orchards have several hundred acres of certified organic production methods and practice Integrated Pest Management to minimize pesticide usage. The Pacific Northwest microclimate has enabled growers to experiment with this specialty crop. Robison Orchards produce a wide assortment of apple varieties. “We see Granny Smith, Honey Crisp, Cosmic Crisp, and other varieties as excellent options of high-quality apples for foreign markets,” said Dave Robison. “We just got to get them there.” Both family farms view the recent trade win of India reopening its market to U.S. apples as beneficial for apple farmers across Washington. The Washington Apple Commission (WAC) and FAS India worked together to regain market access for American apple growers. After retaliatory tariffs were lifted last summer, $10.8 million of U.S. apples were exported to India. This had an almost immediate impact for American apple growers; the market in India opened at the beginning of apple-picking season up in the Pacific Northwest. “Since the tariffs were imposed, other apple origins such as Turkey, Poland, and Iran, took control of the Indian market share, dropping the market share for Washington growers from 53 percent to less than 1 percent in 4 years,” Mark shared with FAS after traveling to India with the WAC in December. “Now that the tariff has been removed, we’ve seen Washington gain back some of the market share that was lost. India is now our fourth largest export market.” USDA is committed to strengthening U.S. exports of apples and other specialty crops. In , specialty crop exports totaled $24.6 billion. FAS is part of the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Initiative (SCCI), which identifies foreign market access and improves domestic production and processing practices. Growing and exporting Washington apples is a prime example of the future-facing American agriculture USDA is working with farmers to achieve. An example of this is FAS’s recently announced Assisting Specialty Crops Exports (ASCE) initiative, which will help expand specialty crop exports. ASCE investments will enable the specialty crops industry to address the many non-tariff barriers it faces when opening or expanding export markets.

Valentin was an intern with AMS for two years through the HACU National Internship Program. Photo Courtesy of Hakim Fobia, AMS Public Affairs Reach one, teach one. That is the approach that USDA has taken in its partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) National Internship Program. As a current employee with the USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and a former HACU intern, I am glad to help continue this tradition. The HACU National Internship Program helps talented students in more than 400 colleges and universities gain valuable experience through paid internships at federal, private, and non-profit organizations. USDA has been a leading organization working with the program, hosting nearly HACU student interns since . I am part of the nearly 46% of former HACU interns who earned the opportunity to stay on board with the federal government after finishing my degree. I accepted the opportunity to continue my career at the USDA after two eventful summers interning with the AMS Commodity Procurement Program. During my tenure as an intern, I applied what I learned in my education and work experience. My time was spent helping develop and implement a new budget tracking system, overlooking a $2.6 million budget, developing budget procedures, and providing support to the daily branch operations. I also got a chance to help develop and implement a new invoicing process using the new Web Based Supply Chain Management System (WBSCM). The WBSCM is now used by AMS to make purchases for the National School Lunch Program and other federal nutrition assistance programs. As I look back on my experience as a HACU intern working at AMS, I really appreciate the way the program works with USDA and other organizations. After applying for the program through my school, the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla Campus, HACU placed me in an organization and position that matched my educational background. Working with the Commodity Procurement staff turned out to be a great fit for me. AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo with students at the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event. Photo courtesy of Karen Comfort, AMS Special Assistant to the Administrator Looking to the future, I am confident that other HACU interns will have similar experiences at USDA and other partner organizations. I recently had the pleasure of attending the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event where AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo inspired all. She gave the keynote address alongside Principal Deputy Under Secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs Robert L. Jesse. It was great to hear Administrator Alonzo encourage the interns to be fearless as they carve out their career paths. She also stressed that they can achieve anything when they are passionate about the fields they choose. I am glad to hear that my office will be welcoming two talented HACU interns this fall. I am excited to be able to share with them my positive experiences and encourage them to tell others about the program¡¯s success with AMS and other USDA agencies. I know that the internship will place them on track for long, fruitful careers and that they will help others follow in their footsteps.

"PhD, RDN, Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Equity  Mar 27,  USDA is proud to celebrate the second anniversary of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack¡¯s vision to advance food and nutrition security. This first-of-its-kind, whole-of-department approach uses a four-pillar approach, working across USDA¡¯s eight mission areas. These pillars include:  Providing nutrition support from pregnancy to birth and beyond;  Connecting everyone in this country with healthy, safe, affordable foods  Developing, translating, and enacting nutrition science through partnership; and  Prioritizing equity every step of the way. Leveraging the momentum of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, we are also doing our part to implement the National Strategy (, 201 ) on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. This whole-of-society strategy was designed to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. And the Biden-Harris Administration remains focused on the Strategy. At a recent White House event, partners pledged nearly $1.7 billion in new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. Our efforts to advance food and nutrition security also integrates the Secretary¡¯s goal to make MyPlate a household name. As I explain in this video, MyPlate has been our national symbol for healthy eating for more than a decade. MyPlate.gov provides the guidance, tools, and resources that translate the - Dietary into actionable steps anyone can use. We are making our MyPlate materials more culturally, contextually, and linguistically responsive. And we work with more than rategic Partners across a variety of sectors to use common messages to communicate to consumers that it¡¯s never too early or too late to start eating healthy. We even launched a MyPlate Instagram, which is loaded with healthy eating tips and recipes. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack Celebrates Progress on Tackling Food and Nutrition Insecurity As we celebrate the power of nutritious food, we are proud of all we¡¯ve accomplished over the last two years, but we know we can do more and do better, together. Please explore our innovative tools and stay connected. We look forward to working together to help everyone in this country access nutrition education through MyPlate.

Unique Varieties at the Headquarters Garden Written by UW-Madison Department of Horticulture and Seed to Kitchen Collaborative There are many interesting varieties around the Headquarters People¡¯s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Visit the tabs below to learn more.  Plant Breeding 101  Have you ever been to the produce aisle and wondered how there got to be so many different types of lettuce? You might be surprised to learn that broccoli, kale, cabbage, and brussels sprouts all come from the exact same plant species. The incredible diversity of produce we have today has been developed over thousands of years, as plants evolved with and alongside humans. Early farmers and foragers would save seeds from plants that had desirable characteristics ¡ª like big fruits or big leaves, excellent flavor, or the ability to store over the winter¡ª and plant those seeds again in the spring, repeating the process season after season. Today, the science of selecting and reproducing certain plant traits is sometimes known as plant breeding.  There are several different ways of breeding plant varieties:  Open-pollinated varieties are those whose characteristics remain stable across generations. Older varieties, also known as heirlooms, are examples of open-pollinated varieties that can be saved in your garden from season to season. These varieties will continue to display the same characteristics of the previous generation. You can even select seeds with your own ideal traits!  Hybrid varieties are created by cross-pollinating two plants from different inbred lines. To develop hybrid varieties, breeders first take two populations of plants with desirable characteristics and reproduce them until the characteristics are stable. Then, they cross-pollinate the two populations to create an offspring that has the characteristics of both populations. Unlike seeds saved from open-pollinated varieties, seeds saved from hybrids often look very different from the parent plants, and instead display a wide diversity of traits that were present in the original populations.  Genetic engineering allows breeders to change individual traits in plant varieties by editing, inserting, or deleting gene sequences using different molecular techniques. There are not very many crops with genetically engineered varieties on the market today, although many are used in commercial farming of corn, soybeans, cotton, and sugar beets.  There are lots of interesting varieties around the People¡¯s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Scan the QR code on the variety sign to learn more.  Beit Alfa Cucumber  Native to present day India and southern China, the cucumber has been a staple in Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines for thousands of years. Early cucumbers were likely quite bitter due to protective compounds in the cucumber skin which discourage insects and other pests from eating them. Over the years, plant breeders have selected varieties for less bitterness and better flavor, bringing to the table the cucumber we recognize today.  In the s, plant breeder Hanka Lazarson began working on an improved cucumber at the Beit Alfa kibbutz in northern Israel. She started with the local Damascus variety, which ¡°tasted good,¡± but produced cucumbers that were unevenly shaped and sized. So, she set out to develop a variety that was more uniform in appearance. As she worked to identify plants that made right-sized fruits, she realized that the increased uniformity also contributed to better flavor and texture. In a journal entry, she wrote, ¡°Our studies showed that if the cavity space of the cucumber is greater relative to the thickness of the shell. It has a juicier flavor and finer texture.¡±  The kibbutz knew they had a great cucumber on their hands, and in , Lazarson started distributing the seeds of the new variety in the Middle East, and quickly, around the world. Since then, hundreds of heirloom and hybrid varieties have counted Beit Alfa as an ancestor. Of the variety she¡¯d defined, she wrote: ¡°Productive variety, excellent taste and high yield: these indicate the type we called Beit Alfa Cucumber.¡±  Beit Alfa cucumbers are small, sweet, prolific, and can be harvested in short order, usually about 55 days from planting. Commonly referred to as a ¡°burpless¡± variety, Beit Alfas have thin skin, few seeds, and lower levels of cucurbitacin, the compound that made early cucumbers so bitter. They are also adaptable to many different growing environments, making them a popular choice among home gardeners.  Nativity Seeds, ¡°Damascus Cucumber To Beit Alfa Cucumber,¡±   Black Beauty Zucchini  The 20th century was a time of massive growth for the seed industry, which used snappy marketing to promote all types of new and interesting fruit and vegetable varieties. For all the pizzazz, it could be difficult for farmers and home gardeners to determine just which new varieties were actual improvements on the seeds they may have already had. Enter the All-America Selections, which rely on a panel of judges and controlled trials to determine the best new varieties on the market.  Black Beauty Zucchini is one such award winner, crowned in for being one of the earliest-ripening and longest-producing varieties of the dark-skinned zucchinis. Black Beauty was bred by John Scarchuk, a plant breeder at the University of Connecticut. Scarchuk received a degree in botany from UConn and began working for the University¡¯s Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station in . He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and returned to Storrs, where he spent the rest of his career. Each state has an Agricultural Experiment Station, designated and funded by the government to promote agricultural innovation across the country and to bring new and useful plant varieties to the American public. During his time at SAES, Scarchuk bred 7 All-America Selection winners, including Candlelight ornamental peppers, Dark Opal basil, and Table King squash. Of Black Beauty, the New York Times in wrote: ¡°This new variety with a heavier crop and longer season will bring added praise. Black Beauty can be picked when merely the size of a big dill pickle or when large as a cucumber. The flesh is tender, sweet, and buttery¡­ The more that is picked, the more that is produced.¡±  Hamilton, Robert. ¡°Tomorrow¡¯s Plants on 7 County Plots.¡± The New York Times,   Hastings, W. Ray. ¡°All-America Flowers Add Vegetables for ¡®57.¡± The New York Times,   P¨¢palo  While many of the fruits and vegetables we eat result from decades, and sometimes centuries, of breeding and selection, other foods on our plate are not that far removed from those we can find in the wild. Porophyllum ruderale is one of those species, a green herbaceous plant that grows extensively across the Americas, especially in disturbed soils.? Because the herb is used by many different cultures, it has many names, including summer cilantro, killi (from Quechua killki?a), cilantro boliviano, and yierba porosa, which refers in Spanish to the large pores on the leaves that release a strong smell when crushed. Perhaps its most common name in the United States, p¨¢palo, comes from the Nahuatl word for butterfly: papalotl. You may recognize other Nahuatl words in our culinary vocabulary, like xococatl (chocolate), tomatl, (tomato), ahuacatl (avocado), chian (chia), and even ch¨©llip¨­ctli (smoked chiles, or chipotle).  Indigenous Americans have used p¨¤palo for centuries as a flavorful, fresh addition to foods and as a medicinal herb, and its existence was an important part of the prehispanic diet. Many people still harvest p¨¢palo from wild sources or introduce it to certain locations, where it is left to establish itself. More recently, p¨¢palo also has been introduced as a cultivated crop on both small and large farms. Farmers who plant and tend p¨¢palo tend to favor plants that are shorter stature, less pungent, and have small, round, well-formed leaves, and the seeds from varieties that carry these characteristics are considered prime examples of the species. For this reason, cultivated p¨¢palo tends to be smaller and less fibrous than its wild relatives¨Ca reminder that humans and the foods we eat are constantly evolving with and alongside one another!

The Boss Pumpkin: An Interview with Plant Breeder Lindsay Wyatt  Anyone who has picked out a pumpkin for carving probably has ideas about what makes an excellent Jack O¡¯ Lantern: a perfect shape, dark orange coloring, maybe a nice, sturdy handle. When Johnny¡¯s Selected Seeds set out to develop a new Halloween pumpkin, plant breeder Lindsay Wyatt had her eye on many of those same things.  ¡°We take on yield and uniformity and color,¡± she said. ¡°The handles also have to be strong enough for someone to pick up a pumpkin by the handle and not break.¡± Importantly, she wanted to breed a pumpkin that was prolific enough for commercial growers to sell at the grocery store. ¡°But we also wanted a pumpkin that would be really nice and lovely for someone to grow in their garden for their kids to carve for Halloween,¡± she added.  At the Johnny¡¯s research farm in Maine, Wyatt and her team make over 70 new hybrid combinations every year, selecting the parent varieties that have desirable traits, and combining them via hand pollination. The next year, they grow the resulting hybrids to determine which combinations produce results that meet their goals. At harvest time, they invite the entire farm crew to walk the field and place a flag near their favorites, like an experimental pumpkin patch.  From the beginning, she knew one variety in particular would be a winner. ¡°It was so good the first year, we grew extra the next year to make sure it wasn¡¯t a fluke. It was almost hard to believe,¡± she said.  When it came time for the crew to place their votes, there were indeed a lot of flags clustered around one plot. The crew was so enthusiastic about the variety, they thought it should have a name that recognized it for being outstanding in the field. ¡°Someone basically said, we should name it The Boss,¡± she laughed. ¡°And we were all like, yeah, that¡¯s the name now.¡±  And where did The Boss get its good looks? Wyatt nods to the late University of New Hampshire professor Dr. Brent Loy, who developed over 80 squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin varieties over his long career. ¡°One of those lines is a big part of The Boss¡¯ genetics,¡± she said. ¡°So this definitely would not be possible without public plant breeding.¡±  Herself an alumna of a public plant breeding program, Wyatt originally studied biology in college before learning about the Plant Breeding Department at Cornell University. Growing up, she had worked summers in her father¡¯s nursery and always wondered where all the different colored petunias came from, but it wasn¡¯t until she started looking for graduate school programs that she realized there was a dedicated field of study for creating new and interesting plant varieties.  As for how she made the leap from petunias to pumpkins, she chalked it up to serendipity and the projects available at Cornell and later, at Johnny¡¯s Seeds. ¡°And then,¡± she added, ¡°I find that once you start working with any crop, you start to love it.¡±  Berkeley Tie Dye Tomato: An Interview with Plant Breeder Brad Gates  If you¡¯re lucky enough to visit a Berkeley Tie Dye plant when it¡¯s fruiting, it may be obvious how this pink and yellow and green-striped tomato came by its name. In fact, according to tomato breeder Brad Gates, the exchange that dubbed this famous heirloom went down with no words at all.  ¡°I was selling tomatoes at the farmers¡¯ market in Oakland, about a mile from Berkeley, and a guy wearing a tie-dye shirt came over and held the tomato to the middle of his chest. He gave me this funny look like, ¡®Hey, it looks just like my shirt...¡¯ I didn¡¯t realize what a pivotal scene was playing out in those few seconds.¡±  Now, Berkeley Tie Dye is known around the world for its groovy looks and gourmet flavor. But when Gates started selling tomatoes, he didn¡¯t even know just how much diversity existed in the crop.  ¡°I started working on a Saturday for a friend doing the farmers market about 25 years ago,¡± he said. ¡°I was expecting to show up and have all these red tomatoes to sell. But there were all these yellow and pink and purple ones and people were asking questions about them. I had to force myself to step outside my comfort zone and start tasting them.¡±  The experience had so intrigued Gates that he decided to grow tomatoes full-time. He started with dozens of heirloom varieties to find the tomatoes that grew well, tasted good, and produced prolifically. ¡°We would get left with a bunch of them at the farmers market and others would sell out,¡± he said. Naturally, he began saving seeds from the varieties that did well.  ¡°With heirloom varieties, you can save your own seeds,¡± he said. And because tomatoes are self-pollinating, you¡¯ll often get a similar tomato year after year. ¡°But once in a great while, you¡¯ll get a natural cross-pollination, and a couple of plants show up that aren¡¯t what they¡¯re supposed to be.¡± As he was growing thousands and thousands of plants for the market, Gates took some of the new crosses he was seeing and began to grow them out, too. ¡°And that was how I got into breeding tomatoes,¡± he said.  Fortunately for the world he did, because he was just about ready to hang up his farmer¡¯s hat and get a different job. But as he saw people¡¯s reactions to the new varieties he was breeding, he decided to stick with it. ¡°I had the thought, ¡®At one point, I¡¯m the only person in the world holding Berkeley Tie Dye.¡¯ And every restaurant I go to, everyone says, ¡®Wow, these tomatoes are amazing. So I was thinking, ¡®Well, the world shouldn¡¯t be without this.¡¯¡±  Gates sells mostly seeds and seedlings now, and you can find varieties he¡¯s bred in farms and gardens from sea level to seven thousand feet. In fact, he says, when someone grows open-pollinated seeds and saves them from year-to-year, they¡¯re creating adaptation to challenging environments.  The diversity preserved in the process will ensure that people can feed themselves in all these different places, he added. ¡°I¡¯ve had people tell me that one of my varieties was the last producing tomato plant in a summer in Tucson, and I¡¯ve had people have good results growing close to the San Francisco Bay, where it¡¯s always cool and foggy.¡±  ¡°Having diverse genetics and being able to select again and again in your area, it¡¯s one of the best things for people who want to grow a garden,¡± he said. ¡°It doesn¡¯t take a white coat and a biology degree. Even a home gardener can grow something unknown or something special that you can¡¯t get at the store.¡±  All it takes, according to Gates, ¡°is common sense and determination to grow a decent number of plants for a decent number of years.¡±","This article features two plant breeders, Dr. Brent Loy and Brad Gates, who have developed new varieties of squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin, as well as tomatoes. The article highlights the importance of public plant breeding in developing new crop varieties, citing Dr. Loy's work on over 80 different lines. It also features an interview with Brad Gates, a tomato breeder who has developed several new heirloom tomato varieties, including the famous ""Berkeley Tie Dye"" tomato. Gates recounts how he started selling tomatoes at farmers' markets and was surprised to find a wide diversity of colors and flavors in the crop. He began saving seeds from the varieties that did well and eventually started breeding his own tomatoes. His work on heirloom tomatoes led him to develop new varieties, such as Berkeley Tie Dye, which is prized for its unique appearance and flavor. The article also touches on the importance of preserving genetic diversity in crops, particularly through open-pollination and seed saving. Gates notes that when people save seeds from year to year, they create adaptation to challenging environments and ensure that there will always be diverse genetics available for future generations. Some key points from the interview with Brad Gates include: * The importance of public plant breeding in developing new crop varieties * The diversity of heirloom tomatoes and the potential for creating new varieties through breeding * The value of preserving genetic diversity through open-pollination and seed saving * The ability of home gardeners to grow unique or special varieties of plants using saved seeds * The importance of determination and common sense in growing a decent number of plants over several years.","There is no mention of Dr. Brent Loy, a plant breeder who has developed new varieties of squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin, in the provided article text.

"FNS Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Mar 10,  This past February, I attended the Urban School Food Alliance winter meeting in Los Angeles, California, which included Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) sessions focused on child nutrition programs. Participants, which included food service directors from around the country, had the opportunity to ask questions about the child nutrition programs they administer, including the recent updates. Engaging with program leaders and seeing what child nutrition programs look like ¡®on the ground¡¯ is important to us. In addition to learning from the group, the meeting was a reminder of the many partners we have that share a common goal of continuing to elevate the role that healthy meals play in schools and for our children¡¯s future. We spent a day at the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) observing their warehouse and kitchen operations, and meeting with school officials. We also got a taste of the delicious meals LAUSD prepares for students. California was one of the first states to implement a statewide Universal Meals Program for all school children after the expiration of federal waivers during COVID, which allowed states to serve school meals at no cost to students. I commend the California state legislature and all state, county, and local anti-hunger advocates that helped to make this happen. As I travel around the country and visit sites that administer FNS food assistance programs and meet nutrition security advocates that share this passion, I am awed by the tremendous amount of work, dedication, and pride exhibited every day so that children in our communities have healthy, nutritious meals.

"Posted by the Food and Nutrition Service's Western Regional Office in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 02,  The first week of August, farmers markets across the nation celebrate National Farmers Market Week, highlighting their role in supporting healthy communities, food systems and stimulating local economies. Throughout the pandemic, farmers markets and USDA partners worked hard to remain safe, accessible outlets for healthy food, as well as a vital marketing outlet for small and mid-sized farmers. Farmers markets put rigorous safety plans in place and the Ecology Center fought to ensure that farmers markets were classified as essential businesses while sharing best practices around pandemic response with the broader farmers market community.

"Acting Deputy Chief, Forest Service Research and Development in  Forestry  Oct 04,  Access to high-quality water will be a defining feature of the 21st century. Record heat waves and drought are not only leading to more frequent and intense wildfires but are also putting one of life¡¯s most valuable resources at risk: the water we drink. A new Forest Service research report describes how extensively public drinking water systems rely on national forests and grasslands. Water use per person has been declining for decades; however, a variety of factors such as population growth, food production and ecosystem conditions under a changing climate are contributing to overall greater demand for water ¨C especially in certain parts of the country. In the West, national forests and grasslands supply drinking water to almost 90% of the people served by public water systems. Some western cities, like Aspen, Colorado, and Portland, Oregon, are more than 90% dependent on national forests alone for their drinking water. The story is similar in the eastern U.S., though most of this water is supplied by private forests. Still, more than a century of research has demonstrated that forested lands provide the cleanest and most stable water supply compared to other lands. Within the lower 48 states, more than 99% of people who rely on public drinking water receive some from forested lands. This report is the first of its kind to measure how individual national forests and grasslands contribute to surface drinking water supplies while accounting for networks of pipelines and canals that divert water from the source to areas of high need, also known as ¡°inter-basin water transfers.¡± These inter-basin transfers are incredibly important sources of drinking water, especially in the West, where cities like Los Angeles receive more than two-thirds of their water from forested lands in California and Colorado. By showing where our drinking water comes from at a fine scale, this report supports USDA¡¯s Wildfire Crisis Strategy, and work supported by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. It helps land managers prioritize forests and watersheds for hazardous fuels reduction, watershed management, and restoration treatments that protect people, communities and resources across the country.

"Why I Love New Mexico¡¯s Forests and Public Lands  I heard a story once about ¡°horny toads¡± from my mother. How she used to catch so many they filled a shoebox. And my grandfather told me about the Lobo¡¯s howl. Both of these animals are rare or endangered now and I have not found one myself. I hope one day to tell my own children about the animals I experience in the forests of New Mexico. Tadpoles, horned owls, fence-tail lizards, trout, coyotes and bats. We hike through the forest into the Rio Grande gorge and I know it is magic. The beauty of it all is more than enchanting, it takes my breath away, or brings me back to it in a way.

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  Mar 02,  FSA Administrator Val Dolcini speaks at the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic. I recently attended the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic in Des Moines, Iowa, where I met with sportsmen, farmers, young people, wildlife biologists and others who are committed to strengthening wildlife habitat throughout America. It was exciting to see firsthand the passion for the native and restored grasslands and woodlands that typify the rural American landscape. I had the honor of speaking to the group, where I highlighted the 30th anniversary of USDA¡¯s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).? CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, is designed to reduce soil erosion, improve water and air quality, and provide habitat for wildlife. Interested landowners can establish long-term USDA-approved grasses or trees in exchange for USDA helping with the cost of establishing the plants and providing annual payments for 10 to 15 years. The covers along fields, streams and rivers prevent soil and nutrients from washing into waterways, reduce soil erosion that may otherwise contribute to poor air and water quality, and provide valuable habitat for wildlife. Since its enactment in , CRP has prevented more than 8 billion tons of soil from eroding, protected more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian and grass buffers, and provided more than 100,000 acres of bottomland hardwood trees and nearly 300,000 acres of flood-plain wetlands.? It has also created more than 250,000 acres each for duck nesting habitat and upland bird habitat. Although this is a federal program, this 30-year record of accomplishment was not achieved by USDA alone.? Partnerships with state, local, and nongovernmental organizations are the foundation upon which these important achievements have been built. Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever¡¯s President and Chief Executive Officer (left) and FSA Administrator Val Dolcini sign an agreement establishing a framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources Conservation Service, to maintain and enhance the productivity of pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitats on private and public lands. That¡¯s why I joined Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever¡¯s President and Chief Executive Officer, in signing an agreement to continue the longtime framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), to maintain and enhance pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitat on private and public lands.? These joint efforts include habitat conservation and restoration, scientific assistance, educational materials, and research collaboration. In addition, this five-year commitment helps support Pheasants Forever¡¯s Farm Bill biologist program at local USDA offices nationwide. Given the strong relationships Pheasants Forever has with farmers and ranchers across the country, including their significant contribution toward the successful sage grouse and lesser prairie chicken initiatives launched by USDA, we are pleased to renew our partnership. On behalf of my colleagues at USDA, I want to thank everyone who plays a role in making conservation programs like CRP so successful, and for helping make rural America, with its diverse flora and fauna, its abundant natural resources and its beautiful natural landscapes, better than we have ever known. CRP was made possible through the Farm Bill. To learn more about the Farm Bill or the Conservation Reserve Program please visit www.usda.gov/farmbill or www.fsa.usda.gov/conservation.

"KY Rural Development, Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Aug 22,   Dozens of people gathered in Monticello, Ky., on Wednesday to break ground on a project in which five local families began the process of building their own homes. Great partnerships can lead to great projects ¨C and this event highlighted several strategic partners that worked incredibly hard to make it happen, including USDA Rural Development, Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, Southern Tier Housing Corporation, the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises (FAHE) and the families of Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Yvonne Hernandez, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. Five families will become homeowners thanks to Rural Development¡¯s Mutual Self-Help and 502 Direct Loan programs. The families, from left, are Yvonne Hernandez, Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. This project began several years ago when Kentucky Highlands received a Rural Development Section 523 Mutual Self Help Housing grant for $250,000 in April . That money was designated for technical assistance to help 12 families that wanted to help build new homes. The selected families also were approved for Rural Development 502 Direct Loan funds, in addition to forgivable loans from FAHE, to pay for the cost of building the homes. The self-help housing ¡°sweat equity¡± concept is not new. Organized self-help housing started with the Quakers a number of years ago. This became a tradition of rural people, who had the determination and help of neighbors, to construct barns, homes and schools that became American¡¯s rural communities. The Section 523 program is used primarily to help very low and low-income households build their own homes and is targeted to families who are unable to buy clean, safe housing through conventional methods. Families participating in a mutual self-help project perform approximately 65 percent of the construction labor on each other¡¯s homes under qualified supervision, and the reduced labor costs make it easier for the families to own a home. Another great advantage of this program is that mortgage payments can be ¡°rolled into¡± the loan for families who can¡¯t afford to make them while the house is being built.

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  May 01,   Farmers and ranchers were among the first to practice conservation. It¡¯s not surprising when you think about it. They¡¯ve always understood the importance of caring for our land and water, and they depend on our natural resources for their livelihoods. They¡¯re at the forefront of our country¡¯s efforts to keep the land healthy, productive and resilient. And we¡¯re proud to partner with them in that effort. This year, we¡¯re celebrating two more conservation milestones: the 30th anniversary of USDA¡¯s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation; and registering the 1 millionth acre in CRP¡¯s State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE) initiative. The 1 millionth acre is part of the Coteau-Drift SAFE, located in North Dakota. The state has a total of four SAFE projects, covering over 122,000 acres.? The projects are helping a wide range of species ¨C from pheasants, grouse, prairie-chicken, grey partridge, deer and other game animals ¨C flourish and grow. The Coteau-Drift SAFE is designed to register more than 69,000 acres in the state¡¯s Missouri Plateau and Drift Prairie region to support waterfowl, shorebirds and terrestrial birds.? Through SAFE, state agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations, and even local groups work together to identify at-risk wildlife, and to submit proposals to USDA for review.? Once approved, agricultural producers within an approved SAFE area can voluntarily enroll acres in 10 to 15 year contracts. In exchange, USDA provides annual rental payments, incentives, and cost-share assistance for establishing plant species that attract wildlife. There are now 98 SAFE habitat partnerships in 37 states and Puerto Rico. And the numbers don¡¯t end there. Each year, through CRP programs, we work with hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers to implement voluntary conservation practices on their operations. CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, provides significant economic and environmental benefits to hundreds of rural communities. CRP initiatives, like SAFE, encourage federal, state and local partnerships, showing us that when we all work together, everyone benefits.

"Farm Service Agency Administrator in  Conservation  Nov 13,  Sample FSA County Committee election ballot. This is a great time of the year for the Farm Service Agency (FSA), not just because of another successful American harvest, but because of the opportunity for agricultural communities throughout the country to vote for officials to represent them on FSA County Committees. In my first year as FSA Administrator, I¡¯ve traveled to 32 states and visited with farmers and ranchers from California to Maine. I know firsthand the impact of successfully delivered farm programs in rural communities all across this great nation. Working with county committee members while serving as FSA state executive director for California and now as Administrator, I have a deep appreciation for the essential role these farmer-elected committees play in connecting FSA with the needs of local producers. County committees have been making a difference for producers for more than eight decades.? They were originally established back in to ensure that local producers could provide input to the federal programs that offered financial assistance to farmers.? Today, nearly 7,700 FSA county committee members serve nationwide by applying their knowledge and judgment to make important decisions on commodity support programs, conservation programs, indemnity and disaster programs, emergency programs and eligibility.? Each county committee has three to 11 elected members who serve three-year terms and one-third of county committee seats are up for election each year. Producers elected to committees have always played a vital role in local agricultural decisions. They are essential to the daily operation of nearly 2,200 offices across the country. It is a valued partnership that helps us better understand the needs of the farmers and ranchers we serve. That is why I am encouraging all eligible producers to vote during this year¡¯s county committee elections. Through your vote, you are selecting someone from your county who will provide critical local input on FSA programs.? The elections began Nov. 9, with the mailing of ballots to all eligible producers. Ballots must be completed and returned to the county office or postmarked by Dec. 7 to be counted. Voters who did not receive a ballot this week can pick one up at their local FSA office. To learn more, visit www.fsa.usda.gov/elections.? Make your vote count!

As rural communities search for new and viable economic approaches, it is becoming clear that one core component of many successful rural communities is the presence of vibrant arts and cultural opportunities. Last month I had the opportunity to speak about rural arts initiatives and how USDA Rural Development is engaged with local communities and private foundations to provide awareness of our infrastructure programs and how they can assist in supporting local cultural strategies. At the Americans for the Arts annual meeting I had the honor of representing USDA on two panels where our Rural Development programs were part of the mix.? The sessions included discussion of ArtPlace, a consortium of national and regional foundations, and their efforts to support rural communities. Projects in Lanesboro, Minnesota and Ajo, Arizona are recent ArtPlace grantees, and we had the opportunity to explore ways in which USDA¡¯s infrastructure programs might be able to leverage this new boost of philanthropic support as these communities work to demonstrate how cultural development is an essential ingredient for rural communities in the next generation. One recent example demonstrating strategic alignment between foundations and USDA is an artist housing project in downtown Minot, North Dakota.?? The Magic City Lofts received an ArtPlace grant in to help complete construction of the building.? And this June, one of the new tenants in the building, the Turtle Mountain Tribal Arts Association received a $97,000 USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant for technical assistance associated with establishing a storefront gallery for tribal artists in the new building. The conference also allowed USDA to discuss our various programs and those of other federal agencies.? Our ongoing collaboration with the Partnership for Sustainable Communities is one way the Obama Administration is supporting rural areas. Last year¡¯s Rural Jobs Accelerator grants were a call to promote regional approaches to economic development, and one of the successful grantees involved a regional cultural strategy in SW Virginia centered on the Crooked Road Heritage Trail.? The project involved funding from USDA, the Economic Development Administration, and the Appalachian Regional Commission.

Artists-in-Residents use their time onsite to build large sculptures that are then placed on display for free public viewing on a 20 acre site amidst the farmland.? Franconia, and its employees and artist residents, though more importantly its thousands of visitors, provide a noteworthy boost to the rural communities of Taylors Falls, MN and St Croix Falls, WI, the latter of which is home to a vibrant local performance theater, the St Croix Festival Theater. ??These engaging destinations struck me a wonderful places to help urban visitors gain a greater appreciation of how cultural enterprises help sustain rural communities. ¡°Franconia Sculpture Park in Taylors Falls, MN is a jewel amidst the farms and provides extra economic boost to the surrounding rural communities as well as cultural enrichment to both local residents and visitors from the Twin Cities.¡± Photo courtesy of Franconia Sculpture Park.

"In Charles City Iowa, USDA Officials Listen to Advice from Business Leaders at White House Roundtable Event  Access to capital, cutting edge technology and more responsive government programs will help drive rural innovation, according to participants at a White House Business Council roundtable in Charles City, Iowa yesterday. Facilitated by USDA Rural Utilities Service (RUS) Administrator Jonathan Adelstein, the forum drew a group of rural business leaders from around the region. They raised issues ranging from the length of time it takes to process passport and visa applications to new regulations on banks and financial institutions. Adelstein, who is one of the Obama Administration¡¯s leading advocates for rural broadband, heard an extensive discussion of the shortcomings of rural broadband in Charles City. At the same time, rural telephone cooperatives described their success working with RUS to improve their systems. Charles City Mayor Jim Erb told Adelstein there exists a ¡°rural-rural¡± divide in which some communities receive exceptional broadband service while others do not. Adelstein said the Obama Administration is working to extend high speed broadband throughout rural America and that USDA programs may be able to help. The probability that economic development and job creation in rural areas will be driven by access to high speed broadband was stressed.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Apr 04,  Dr. Samuel Discua is a postdoctoral researcher at University of Arizona Yuma in the Department of Entomology, where he studies the ecology and management of insect pests associated with leafy greens and melons in Arizona cropping systems. Yuma and the rest of the state lead national lettuce crop production. His research currently focuses on the role of host plants in the transfer of insect-transmitted diseases in lettuce and melons. He also teaches a series of courses at University of Yuma on Agricultural Systems Management and Crop Production. Discua first learned about the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) E. Kika De La Garza (EKDLG) Science Fellowship through Roberto Gonzalez, his local USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement (OPPE) liaison, who encouraged him to apply. Discua was looking for ways to connect and collaborate with USDA scientists, as well as opportunities to support his students by learning more about USDA grants and programs. EKDLG Fellowships are designed specifically to introduce faculty and staff from Hispanic-serving institutions (HSI) and Hispanic-serving school districts to the USDA resources available to them. After spending a week in Washington, D.C. with other EKDLG fellows learning about USDA opportunities and resources, Discua had the chance to engage with USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists in Salinas, California. ¡°They tackle similar agricultural challenges to those in Yuma,¡± he said. ¡°My work is interdisciplinary, involving collaboration with plant pathologists, weed scientists, and fellow entomologists, both within the university and ARS.¡± Since this experience, Discua has regularly shared information about various USDA opportunities with students and colleagues back at the University of Arizona Yuma. Discua considers the connections he made with fellow HSI faculty and staff among the most rewarding aspect of the fellowship, and he appreciates the opportunity he was given to connect with research colleagues from other Hispanic serving institutions. ¡°We share a desire to help students finish college and succeed,¡± he said. ¡°We established long lasting bonds as well as professional collaborations that will continue long after our fellowship experience.¡±  Category/Topic:  Equity  Initiatives  Tags:  Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement  OPPE  careers  jobs  equity  Hispanic-serving institutions  Arizona  You May Also Like  National Scholar¡¯s Roots Run Deep in Agriculture  CAPAL Intern Driven to Change Food Insecurity  HEP/CAMP Intern Draws Inspiration from USDA",What role do host plants play in the transfer of insect-transmitted diseases in lettuce and melons?,"According to Dr. Samuel Discua's research, host plants play a significant role in the transfer of insect-transmitted diseases in lettuce and melons.

"The Program The Farm Bill created the Program to help underserved farmers, ranchers and foresters who have historically experienced limited access to USDA programs and services. The Farm Bill expanded the Program to include veterans. The objective of the Program is to show USDA¡¯s commitment to ensuring that underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters can equitably participate in USDA programs. Grants are awarded to community-based and non-profit organizations, higher education institutions and eligible tribal entities with at least 3 years of experience in working with socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers or veteran farmers and ranchers. Individual farmers and ranchers are not eligible to apply for Program grants. Because of differences in demographics, culture, economics, language and other factors, there is no one single approach to identifying solutions that can benefit underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. Program partners are based in local communities and rural areas where they serve a critical role in maximizing USDA¡¯s outreach efforts by identifying systemic barriers that need to be removed and working to increase equitable participation in USDA¡¯s programs and services. Projects funded under the Program include, but are not limited to, conferences, workshops and demonstrations on various farming techniques and other efforts to connect underserved farmers and ranchers to USDA local officials to help communities increase their awareness of USDA¡¯s programs and services.

"Technical Information Specialist, National Agricultural Library in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 22,  What recipes are you looking forward to this fall? Do foods like pumpkin, apples, soups, casseroles and baked goods come to mind? Here are four recipe ideas to bring nutrition and seasonal flavors to your table:  Roasted Root Vegetables: This recipe is packed with fiber, vitamins and minerals. Get potassium from the potatoes and rutabaga, vitamin C from the turnips and sweet potatoes, and vitamin A from the carrots and sweet potatoes.  Lentil Soup: Warm up with soup as the weather gets cooler. One cup of cooked lentils provides nearly 18 grams of plant protein and 16 grams of fiber to help keep you full between meals.  Pumpkin Pancakes: Pumpkin is a fall favorite for kids and adults! These pancakes use one cup of whole wheat flour to add more fiber compared to all-purpose (white) flour alone. Try topping them with yogurt, fruit or nuts.  Banana Oatmeal Cookies: Baking is a fun family activity, especially when it is too chilly to get outside. With no added sugar, these cookies are sweetened naturally from bananas and raisins, which also provide potassium. These recipes are just some of the many flavorful and nutritious options that could be enjoyed this fall.

"ARS Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Jan 17,  It may be winter, but it is still possible to access fresh, locally-grown produce. How? With aquaponics. Americans and people living around the world can grow crops year-round in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of their regions¡¯ climate or season. It also has the added benefit of supplying fresh fish to the local food system. ¡°Aquaponics is a blend of aquaculture and hydroponics, and is the most rapidly growing segment of global agriculture,¡± said Carl Webster, research biologist at the Agricultural Research Service¡¯s (ARS) Harry K. Dupree Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center in Arkansas. The aquaponics system begins with tanks where fish are grown ¨C usually tilapia, channel catfish, and hybrid striped bass. In these tanks, bacteria breaks down fish waste (feces and ammonia) into natural fertilizer. Farmers then irrigate their plants with this fertilizer in a hydroponic growing chamber. Plants raised using aquaponics typically include crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers. The result of aquaponics is a steady supply of fresh fish and vegetables that are available in local communities throughout the year and are grown in just about any environment ¨C from an abandoned inner-city warehouse to a climate-controlled facility in the middle of a desert. Additionally, aquaponics does not just benefit local communities; it also serves as an innovative and invaluable tool in addressing some of the world¡¯s most pressing challenges like hunger and climate change. ¡°According to the United Nations, there will be more than 9 billion people living on our planet by . We need to be smarter about how we grow food,¡± said Benjamin Beck, research leader at the ARS Aquatic Animal Health Research unit in Auburn, Alabama. ¡°Minimizing the space used to grow food and/or growing more than one crop at the same time could help relieve pressure on land production of crops while still providing a locally-grown source of food.¡±  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  Agricultural Research Service  ARS  USDA Science  fish  aquaculture  hydroponics  aquaponics  sustainable farming  You May Also Like  USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians¡¯ Engines  Meet Mari Gomez¡ªPublic Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community  Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",What are some innovative ways to grow crops year-round in various environments using aquaponics systems?,"* Growing crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers * Minimizing space used to grow food by growing multiple crops at the same time * Growing crops in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of climate or season * Using abandoned inner-city warehouses or climate-controlled facilities in deserts as aquaponics systems"
"Posted by Agricultural Research Service Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Nov 23,  For many families, a Thanksgiving meal would not be the same without the sweet, tart goodness of cranberry dishes. A project funded by USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) at Oregon State University (OSU) is working to ensure that staple stays on the table. ¡°Weeds ¨C moss in particular ¨C are a big challenge to cranberry production, but the number of herbicides labeled for use on cranberry is relatively low,¡± said Cassie Bouska, associate professor of practice with OSU Extension Service. ¡°We lack effective controls for weeds that can, and ultimately will, take over a cranberry bed and drastically reduce production.¡± Research from Washington state found that increasing moss pressure reduced yield by at least half. With decreased cranberry yields and lower prices, some growers have struggled to break even in recent years.  ¡°That impacts the economic stability of farm families and rural communities,¡± Bouska said. ¡°An economically sustainable farm can move forward and find ways to improve its environmental sustainability.¡± A cranberry bed is a complete mat of cranberry vines ¨C 100% ground cover. Established weeds are difficult to control and hand weeding is time-consuming and expensive. As a result, the research team is studying various weed control tools and techniques to tackle troublesome weeds and may be closing in on a breakthrough. ¡°We¡¯ve tested some products that are very effective at controlling moss, while causing minimal or no damage to the cranberries,¡± Bouska said. ¡°Next year¡¯s field work will provide indications of whether there are additive effects of year-on-year applications. We¡¯re optimistic that we have some good candidates.¡±  Ensuring farming stays viable and profitable for our producers is essential. USDA research like this is helping to maintain and improve U.S. cranberry production so that your family can continue to enjoy your favorite cranberry dishes during the holiday season and throughout the year.

"USDA, FNS and written by Hannah Benson, Project Bread Program Manager in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 08,  Several studies consistently link poor access to food to poor health outcomes, including heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Project Bread, a Massachusetts¡¯ nonprofit focused on permanently solving food insecurity, teamed up with MassHealth to pilot the Flexible Services Program, or FSP, to bolster food security and meet nutritional needs from birth throughout childhood and beyond, improving health outcomes at every stage of life. Since April , over 7,000 MassHealth members (ranging in age from 0 months to 64 years) with complex health issues were given an array of food resources, including gift cards for groceries, cooking supplies, refrigerators, cooking classes, transportation assistance, and nutrition education. A recent evaluation of 491 clients, who engaged in the program between November ¨C October , significantly improved their diet and health as follows:  25% became food secure  Fruit and vegetable consumption increased by 3.5 servings per week  SNAP enrollment increased by 12.4%  99% reported that participation in FSP improved their health Project Bread employs 11 nutrition services coordinators to serve MassHealth clients across several languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Cape Verdean Creole, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Vietnamese. These coordinators help address racial inequity in underserved communities, as these communities are disproportionately affected by social and economic barriers to good health. The program has made life-changing improvements for many participants. When John A. in Gardner, MA lost his job as a cook at age 52, his diet and his health deteriorated, impacting his ability to regain employment. FSP resources gave John the opportunity to take back his diet and his future. ¡°Not only has this program helped me financially in terms of paying for groceries, but the cooking shows [hosted by Project Bread chefs and nutritionists] have reignited my passion for cooking.

Additionally, some effective ways to address food insecurity and improve nutritional outcomes in underserved communities through agricultural initiatives include: 1. Community Garden Projects: Establishing community gardens can provide access to fresh produce, increase food security, and promote physical activity. 2. Urban Agriculture Initiatives: Encouraging urban agriculture projects can help increase access to healthy foods, create jobs, and stimulate local economies. 3. Farm-to-School Programs: Implementing farm-to-school programs can connect schools with local farmers, providing students with fresh produce and educational experiences about agriculture and nutrition. 4. Agricultural Education and Training: Providing training and education on sustainable agriculture practices, food safety, and nutrition can help build capacity in underserved communities. These initiatives can be tailored to specific community needs and contexts, but they share the common goal of addressing food insecurity and improving nutritional outcomes through agricultural means."
"USDA Equity Commission Communications Lead in  Equity  Initiatives  Mar 14,  As a Latina woman, raised in a black community by a single white mother, Poppy Sias-Hernandez understands how access to equitable support and resources can have a life changing impact. In , Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer appointed Sias-Hernandez as the first-ever Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer (EIO) in the Executive Office of the Governor. In addition to her role as the Chief EIO, she also serves as the Executive Director of the Office of Global Michigan. In February , Sias-Hernandez became one of 15 members appointed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Equity Commission. Appointees serve two-year terms and bring a unique understanding of their individual fields and professional niches. The commission and its two subcommittees ¨C the Agriculture Subcommittee and Rural Community Economic Development Subcommittee - are tasked with evaluating USDA programs and services and recommending ways USDA can reduce barriers to access by implementing transformative changes. Sias-Hernandez credits gaining access to an affordable community college education with changing her life¡¯s trajectory. After high school, Sias-Hernandez moved to California to live with her father. There, she was able to take community college classes for $15 per credit hour, a complete departure from Michigan where community college was not financially accessible or feasible. This opportunity allowed her to become the first in her family to receive a college education, which included a bachelor¡¯s degree from University of California at Berkley and a master¡¯s degree in Organizational Change Leadership from Western Michigan University, where she received a Thurgood Marshall Fellowship. Her first class at Berkely was titled ¡°Women of Color in the U.S.¡±. According to Sias-Hernandez, that¡¯s where she did a lot of early thinking regarding issues concerning equity and inclusion. The experiences and knowledge gained from that course have been formative over the course of her personal and professional life. Sias-Hernandez credits the young female professor teaching the course with recognizing that the material had ¡°lit a fire within her¡±. Sias-Hernandez explains, ¡°She said to me, ¡®This is going to be a challenge in life. Are you ready? You are going to have to find a way to drive the change you want to see while understanding that you will likely never see it.¡¯¡± These words became the foundation to Sias-Hernandez¡¯s life. ¡°That was so formative and has been throughout my life because it is the truth,¡± said Sias-Hernandez. ¡°I still have that mindset. How do you keep showing up with love, integrity, and generosity knowing you¡¯re not always going to see the change you are working for?¡± As a professional, Sias-Hernandez has devoted much of her 20-plus year career to building and creating equity. During the pandemic, Sias-Hernandez partnered with other Michigan state government departments to build a migrant community response model to provide access to healthcare, financial assistance, and other resources to impacted farmworkers. One of her partners in this project, the Michigan Secretary of Agriculture, encouraged Sias-Hernandez to apply for the USDA Equity Commission. Initially, Sias-Hernandez was apprehensive about a potential role on the Commission, but says she quickly discovered how much good work was possible. More than six months into the work, she says she¡¯s impressed by the collective expertise of the Commission, and the group¡¯s willingness to collaborate and share their individual gifts, talents, and lived experiences. ¡°I am loving this Commission. I am loving the learning; I am loving the high level of commitment,¡± she said. ¡°It¡¯s the right formula to create terrific momentum and you have these Commissioners who are just super committed to doing good work.¡± From Sias-Hernandez's viewpoint, the work of the Equity Commission creates systems that are accessible to all population groups. ¡°Sometimes you hear equity talked about through an individual lens, referenced as meeting people where they are,¡± said Sias-Hernandez. ¡°But I really think about equity through a systems level lens and through a population level lens.¡± Sias-Hernandez describes governmental systems and programs like a current in a stream. ¡°These systems should be designed to keep people in the current. But what actually happens is that some people have to swim upstream to access the current, because it really wasn¡¯t made for them,¡± she said. ¡°My vision for equity is that we are creating a current that captures all people; that anyone can step into the stream and swim with the current rather than having to struggle against it.¡±  Category/Topic:  Equity  Initiatives  Tags:  equity  USDA  You May Also Like  Reflections from the Road in Pennsylvania: Charting the Path Forward with Urban Agriculture and the Next Generation  Dr. Jennie L.

"-Young, Under Secretary, Research, Education, and Economics & USDA Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Feb 28,  As I reflect on Black History Month, I think about the tremendous accomplishments and contributions made by Black Americans. I think of the past, present and future to acknowledge how far we¡¯ve come, where we are now, and the challenges ahead. For me, one the most concerning challenges still facing Black Americans is the disproportional high rates of cancer and chronic diseases. With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting half of all African American adults have some form of cardiovascular disease, and that Black men and women have the highest rates of dying from cancer ¨C something must change. This issue hits very close to home for me. Growing up in Georgia, food was a part of my communities¡¯ culture and heritage. Food brought people together, the dishes were delicious, however they weren¡¯t always good for our health. This led to many of our staple dishes being loaded with excess sodium and calories. Unfortunately, it was this approach to eating that left many of my family members ultimately fighting heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, and cancer. As jarring as this may seem, this is just one of many similar stories shared by Black Americans. Recently in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I heard similar experiences echoed by Black community members at a listening session at Southern University. This listening session was the first in a series hosted by USDA¡¯s Agricultural Science Center of Excellence for Nutrition and Diet for Better Health (ASCEND for Better Health) to discuss how food access, nutrition security, and diet affect health outcomes in underserved communities. ASCEND for Better Health is a new USDA initiative that aims to reduce the burden of diet-related chronic diseases, like cancer, by enhancing precision nutrition research and sharing that research with the communities it impacts. ASCEND for Better Health also supports President Biden¡¯s Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it and is tied to the goals laid out in the White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. As we step into National Nutrition Month tomorrow, I am hopeful for the future health and wellbeing of Black Americans thanks to initiatives like USDA¡¯s ASCEND for Better Health. A brighter future is ahead in which healthy, nutritious foods are accessible to all and specific nutrition advice is available so everyone can live long, high-quality and prosperous lives.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Jul 08,  According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 5.8 million Americans aged 65 or older live with Alzheimer¡¯s disease, and that number is projected to nearly triple by . Fortunately, USDA-funded research may have found a tasty way to slow disease onset. A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that diets high in flavonoids may protect cognitive health. Flavonoids are plant nutrients known for their antioxidant, antiviral, and anticancer properties and are found in berries, tea, dark chocolate, and other foods. ¡°Alzheimer¡¯s disease is a significant public health challenge,¡± said Paul Jacques, nutritional epidemiologist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. ¡°Given the absence of drug treatments, preventing Alzheimer¡¯s disease through a healthy diet is an important consideration.¡± Jacques¡¯s study, which followed 2,809 people for nearly 20 years, revealed that diets high in fruits and vegetables showed significant promise to quell the onset of Alzheimer¡¯s. ¡°Our study showed that individuals with the highest intakes of flavonoids were more than 50% less likely to develop Alzheimer¡¯s disease, relative to those with the lowest intakes,¡± he said. ¡°Plant foods, such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds are good sources of flavonoids.¡± According to Jacques, flavonoid-rich diets help more than just Alzheimer¡¯s disease and related dementia. ¡°The bottom line is that there are many reasons to consume a healthy diet, including lower risks of cardiovascular disease and some cancers.

"and Jess Ryan, USDA-ARS Office of Communications in  Research and Science  May 30,  The U.S. cotton industry contributes 35% of the cotton exported globally. Cotton processing can require intense work and training, including the proper use of the cotton gins commonly used to speed up the cleaning process of cotton seeds, removal of foreign materials, and compression of the cotton into lint bales. In perspective, one bale of cotton can make more than 200 pairs of jeans or 1,200 t-shirts. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service shows 509 active cotton gins are currently operating in the U.S. Recently, the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the National Cotton Ginners Association (NCGA) partnered in an annual outreach program to provide cotton ginners education and training for industry workers. USDA-ARS research leaders and the NCGA Vice President lead the efforts with assistance from USDA-ARS scientists, NCGA member associations, land grant universities, industry partners, and stakeholder groups. ""These annual schools are a significant outreach program to the industry and a diverse group of workers,"" said Greg Holt, research leader at the Cotton Production and Processing Research Unit in Lubbock, Texas.

"ARS Office of Communications in  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Jun 07,  Today is World Food Safety Day, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has launched a sweeping new initiative known as the Salmonella Grand Challenge. The project brings together an elite group of ARS, university and food industry scientists from different specialties to fight Salmonella, a foodborne pathogen that sickens over a million Americans each year, sometimes fatally. The challenge complements the work being done by the Food Safety and Inspection Service to develop a more effective strategy to reduce human Salmonella illness linked to poultry. ARS¡¯ goal is to integrate its research to learn more about how and where Salmonella causes the highest risk of contamination to meat and poultry products. That information will help researchers develop better monitoring tools for meat and poultry producers to detect Salmonella contamination. Salmonella, the bacterium that causes the illness called salmonellosis, lurks just about everywhere ¨C on animals (including pets), in food, water, soil and even air. People infected by Salmonella suffer symptoms that can include diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting. Serious infections can lead to life-long health problems and even death. The ARS team will integrate its ongoing research by combining, standardizing and coordinating efforts to create harmonized datasets. This will help them identify larger trends, emerging threats and novel Salmonella mitigation strategies. That¡¯s a large task because there are over 2,500 types of Salmonella bacteria and their risks are different across all production systems. The research team will use machine-learning tools to manage and bring together this huge amount of . The collaboration will help researchers learn from each other and will hopefully lead to break-through discoveries. The Salmonella Grand Challenge will enable researchers to better understand Salmonella risk, develop accurate models, and develop tools for meat and poultry producers to monitor their operations. Ultimately, the team hopes their efforts will contribute to the Healthy People objective of reducing salmonellosis by 25%.

"National Agricultural Statistics Service Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Mar 17,  The states that produce some of the most nutritious and most consumed commodities within each of the five food groups. Many people want to cultivate healthier eating habits and March, National Nutrition Month, may be a great time to start. USDA¡¯s Food and Nutrition Service¡¯s MyPlate website is a resource available to help get on (or back on) the nutrition track. MyPlate itself is divided into five major food groups ¨C vegetables, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy and fortified soy alternatives. But do you ever wonder where your food comes from, and how much our hardworking farmers and ranchers produce in a year? Here are facts about some of America¡¯s favorite, nutritious foods: According to USDA¡¯s Economic Research Service (ERS), the tomato is one of the most commonly eaten vegetables in the country. In , U.S. farmers produced 24.1 billion pounds of tomatoes with California producing more than 97%. Apples are also a big hit in the U.S.. In , our growers produced nearly 11 billion pounds, nearly 69% of which came from Washington state. The average yield from each of Washington¡¯s 172,000 total apple bearing acres was 44,200 pounds! For , check out the Non-Citrus Fruits & Nuts Annual Report. Wheat, a health-promoting grain found in many foods, is one of our largest field crops. In , U.S. farmers produced 1.8 billion bushels of it, with North Dakota producing more than 17% of the total. For animal protein, according to ERS, chicken still tops the list in American diets. In , 58.3 billion pounds of chicken were produced in the U.S., more than 14% or 8.3 billion pounds in the top producing state of Georgia. New will be available on April 29 in the Poultry Production and Value Report. Finally, there is dairy. Versatile and packed with important nutrients, fluid beverage milk is one of the most consumed dairy products in the country. Americans consumed more than 46.4 billion pounds, or 5.4 billion gallons, of it last year alone.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .23  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, Sept. 26, ¨C The U.S. Department of Agriculture today announced that it is giving an estimated 3,000 more school districts in high-need areas the option to serve breakfast and lunch to all students at no cost, by expanding the availability of the Community Eligibility Provision, commonly known as CEP. ¡°Today¡¯s announcement comes as we approach the one-year anniversary of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, where the Biden-Harris Administration promised to advance a pathway to healthy school meals for all students,¡± said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ¡°USDA has taken an important step toward fulfilling that promise by expanding access to CEP. Increasing access to free, healthy school breakfast and lunch will decrease childhood hunger, improve child health and student readiness, and put our nation on the path to better nutrition and wellness.¡± CEP is a simplified meal service option that allows schools to provide meals at no cost to all students without requiring families to apply for free and reduced-price meals. Instead, school districts receive federal funding based on a formula using existing from SNAP and other programs, and local or state funds must fill any gap between program costs and federal support. Before this final rule, at least 40% of students had to live in households participating in certain income-based federal assistance programs, in order for a school, group of schools, or school district to be eligible for CEP. This final rule lowers that threshold from 40% to 25%. While this change in CEP applies across the country, it will be particularly impactful in states and school districts which commit to supporting healthy school meals for all students with their own funds. Eight states have taken additional permanent actions to make sure hunger is not a barrier to children¡¯s success, in addition to allowing eligible schools to participate in CEP. California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont passed state laws allowing their schools to serve healthy school meals to all their students at no cost. In these states, schools that previously were not eligible for CEP can now take advantage of this final rule to experience more efficient, streamlined school meal operations as well as predictable federal funding levels. CEP ¨C and all models for providing healthy school meals for all at no cost ¨C is a win-win for schools, kids, families and communities and provides many benefits, including:  Lowering food costs for families;  Increasing food and nutrition security, especially for students from households that barely miss the cutoff to be eligible for free and reduced-price school meals;  Eliminating school meal debt;  Reducing social stigma for students who eat free or reduced-price meals, while other students pay full price;  Increasing student participation in school breakfast and lunch programs, which increases revenues and helps schools offer healthier meals; and  Saving time by simplifying program operations for hardworking school nutrition staff. ¡°Healthy school meals are an essential part of the school environment ¡ª just like teachers, classrooms and books ¨C and set kids up for success and better health,¡± said Stacy Dean, USDA deputy under secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. ¡°More children are fueled for learning and development when they can count on tasty, nutritious meals at school. While there is still more work ahead to ensure every K-12 student in the nation can access healthy school meals at no cost, this is a significant step on the pathway towards that goal.¡± USDA is also supporting expanded access to healthy school meals by offering extensive financial support for schools, including providing:  50 cents more per lunch and 18 cents more per breakfast for school year -24, compared to last school year¡¯s base reimbursement rates, through annual inflation adjustments and Supply Chain Assistance;  $30 million in Healthy Meals Incentives grants to 264 small and rural school districts nationwide;  $30 million in Equipment Grants for states and school districts operating school lunch programs; and  Nearly $11 million in Farm to School Grants, serving 1.2 million children. USDA also continues to expand its Direct Certification for Medicaid Demonstration Projects, which ensure that eligible children in households receiving Medicaid benefits automatically receive free or reduced price school meals without their families filling out an application. The demonstration projects have been implemented in 38 states, and USDA continues to invite more states to participate. In school year -, 1.4 million students received free and reduced-price school meals thanks to direct certification through Medicaid.

"State Director, Southern New England, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 26,  As USDA Rural Development (RD) highlights National Cooperative Month, one worker owned co-op in Massachusetts stands out as a model for sustainability, collaboration, and local food system resiliency. The saying goes ¡°it¡¯s not easy being green.¡± But for Real Pickles in Greenfield, Massachusetts, the co-op wouldn¡¯t have it any other way; they went green in with the addition of solar panels on its roof. Real Pickles Cooperative of Massachusetts RD assisted with the effort, providing $20,000 through the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). The 18.06kWH PV Solar System on the roof of the business was installed by neighboring worker owned solar co-op, PV Squared, and replaced 100 percent of the pickle co-op¡¯s energy needs at that time. So how did this green, innovative co-op come about? Two decades ago, Dan Rosenberg saw a need. Most pickles in the area were being produced with vinegar and preservatives. The old-fashioned pickle that Grandma used to make- naturally fermented with naturally occurring live cultures- was missing from local grocery store shelves. Determined to bring them back, Dan brought some veggies home from an organic vegetable farm where he worked and began making pickles the old-fashioned way. He was soon joined by wife and business partner, Addie Rose Holland, and Real Pickles launched in . They processed their pickles at a business incubator kitchen created by Franklin County Community Development Corporation, which provided a venue for making value-added foods with local farm ingredients. In , Real Pickles moved into their own building and expanded their operations. Today, the co-op sources its produce from eight locally owned farms and the future looks bright. Addie said, ¡°Real Pickles is rooted in this community and it has been supported by this community for the last 21 years. Becoming a worker owned cooperative helps to maintain jobs in our community and continues the cycle of local economic development.¡± When asked for her favorite pickle pun, Addie said, ¡°We¡¯re kind of a big ¡°dill.¡± We couldn¡¯t agree more.

"Public Affairs Specialist with guest author Somali Bantu Community Association (SBCA) of Maine Executive Director Muhidin Libah and SBCA Intern Holden Turner in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Sep 22,  It¡¯s eight in the morning, and farmers with hand hoes and buckets have been here for two hours already, weeding and watering their plots before the heat of the day. Over 200 members of the Somali Bantu community of Lewiston, Maine, make the short drive out to Liberation Farms a few times each week to tend their crops. Visitors to our farm often comment on how few weeds they spot between stalks of corn. It¡¯s not magic, we tell them: our farmers are constantly in friendly competition to see who can have the best-looking plot. Like a large-scale community garden, Liberation Farms allows families to grow food for themselves. We want to feed our kids the foods that we grew up with in Somalia, like corn, greens, and goat meat. Working together, we can make this happen in a way we never could have individually. In , support from community partners helped us move our farm operations onto a single property where we have room for everyone ¨C and a herd of goats, too! Many people in our community are supporting large families through hourly-wage jobs. Since high-quality produce is otherwise unaffordable for us, growing for ourselves at Liberation Farms is a path to financial savings and food independence. We also use the SNAP and WIC programs to give our community and others much-needed nourishment, boosting the health and cultural connections of younger generations. Liberation Farms is also growing our Iskaashito program, through which farmers work together to sell vegetables at our farmers markets and farm stand. People beyond the Somali Bantu community are buying everything from cornmeal to tomatoes from us, and we encourage them to use food stamps to turn just a few dollars into a fresh basket of veggies. We are so excited to see what the future brings now that we have found a home here in Maine.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Dec 20,  Years ago, I spent my days watching pecan roots change the color of solutions from clear to red as they reduced iron for uptake. It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children¡¯s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics. Now, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I¡¯m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change. As an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce. My internship introduced me to the importance of agricultural research and attracted me to a career where I could use science to inform agricultural policy.

"Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Jun 22,  The Food and Nutrition Service¡¯s Mid-Atlantic Region recently joined forces with the New Jersey Department of Agriculture to recognize Programs for Parents, a Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) sponsor in Essex County, NJ, with a regional CACFP Achievement Award for their creative and dedicated efforts to promote nutrition security among children. Their program emphasizes meal quality, nutrition education, and the overall wellness of its childcare providers, children and parents/caregivers. Programs for Parents uses a variety of communication tools, shared in both English and Spanish, to translate the dietary into easy-to-use materials for childcare providers and families. Targeted Facebook posts focus on the importance of incorporating fruit and vegetables into food patterns, watching sugar content, and reading nutrition labels. They recently established a CACFP Facebook group where local childcare providers can share healthy recipes and ideas while also receiving nutrition and wellness tips. Programs for Parents uses their monthly newsletter, ¡°Child Care Matters,¡± to educate providers, parents and stakeholders on the value of good nutrition in early child development. A recent article discussed studies that have shown kids who eat breakfast have better attention spans and included a list of good morning foods for kids. Programs for Parents also offers hands-on learning to their communities. A registered dietitian nutritionist facilitated a virtual cooking class for providers last fall. The program sent providers three recipes in advance and provided them with a $25 gift card to offset the cost of ingredients they purchased to use during the class. Participants learned to make tasty turkey burger sliders and healthy snacks for children. Last year Programs for Parents also launched incentive grants of up to $ for CACFP providers, enabling them to purchase kitchen and food prep items such as refrigerators, freezers, crockpots, and utensils to help providers make healthy snacks and meals. Nearly all of the providers participated, and CACFP enrollment increased by 25%. The Programs for Parents CACFP program, operating since , is a great example of the inroads that early childcare providers can make into better health and nutrition for children and families in need.

"APHIS Legislative and Public Affairs in  Animals  Dec 04,  Bats are crucial to the wellbeing of our natural ecosystems, but also have the potential to spread disease. APHIS Wildlife Services and the One Health Commission recently sponsored a student infographic contest to help change the narrative on bats. Lately, when we hear about bats in the news it's often in the context of emerging infectious diseases. Yet, despite potential public health threats, bats are extremely important to the health of our natural ecosystems. Zoonotic diseases, or zoonoses, are those diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans. To help educate young adults about the importance of bats to our environment, as well as the potential for some bats to transmit zoonoses, such as rabies, USDA Wildlife Services (WS) and the One Health Commission (OHC) recently sponsored an infographic competition among college students. An infographic is a creative collection of images, charts, and minimal text to present or other information. ¡°To ensure participating college students had a good understanding of the issues surrounding bats and disease before they started designing their infographics, we developed a 5-minute video explaining the One Health approach and why it is key to addressing wildlife diseases like rabies.¡± states Alison Barbee, a biological science technician with the rabies research project at the WS National Wildlife Research Center. The One Health approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of people, animals, and the environment. It also encourages experts from multiple disciplines to work together locally, nationally and globally to achieve the best health for all three. The control of human rabies deaths and exposures through the vaccination of animal reservoirs, such as domestic dogs and terrestrial wildlife, is considered an example of a successful One Health approach. WS, OHC, and other agencies are building upon that success to address concerns about bats and the spread of rabies, as well as other diseases. ¡°If we are going to successfully manage bat rabies and other novel viruses for the benefit of bats, people and the environment, we need to better understand how these pathogens are maintained and spread in bat populations,¡± states Barbee. ¡°We also need to effectively communicate that information with others.¡± Winning infographic on bats and rabies created by Colorado State University graduate student Brooke MacNeill. The winner of the infographic contest was Brooke MacNeill, a graduate student in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University. MacNeill¡¯s infographic focused on the role of bats in the environment, and what is being done to prevent the spread of rabies from wildlife to people. Her design targeted students in grades 6 through 12 and was created in both English and Spanish. She received a $500 cash award and her design was shared with natural resources, public health, and One Health practitioners around the globe. The runner up was Stephen Nachtsheim a graduate student in Biomedical Communications at the University of Toronto. His design focused on the benefits of bats and their population declines due to various diseases. He received a $100 cash prize.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Jan 27,  The Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program helps vets repay qualified student loans for service as food animal veterinarians in selected areas of the country. (iStock image) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio. A solid education is crucial to those seeking careers in animal science. However, many student loans can be burdensome. But a student loan payment the size of a mortgage couldn¡¯t stop someone who has wanted to be a veterinarian since they learned to talk. Dr. Annie Bowes is one of those people. After acquiring the knowledge to begin her dream career, Dr. Bowes was left with overwhelming debt.? Luckily for this Idaho-based veterinarian, she wasn¡¯t left alone to repay it. In , she received assistance through the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) a program funded by USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Through VMLRP, NIFA may repay up to $25,000 each year of student loan debt to eligible veterinarians. ?In return, qualified veterinarians must agree to provide food animal medical care for three years in certain high-priority veterinary shortage situations.? VMLRP has helped 245 veterinarians since the program¡¯s inception in . ¡°I am thankful for this assistance,¡± Bowes said. ¡°It allowed me to establish myself in a rural area where it¡¯s difficult to be successful. I am now able to treat animals at six to eight different farms per day and have more than 600 repeat clients.¡± Veterinarians are critical to America¡¯s food safety, food security, and to the health and well-being of both animals and humans. Studies indicate there are significant shortages of food animal veterinarians in certain areas of the country. A leading cause for the scarcity in this profession is the heavy price tag that four years of professional veterinary medical training carries, which leaves current graduates of veterinary colleges with an average debt of $162,000. Bowes owns Aspen Veterinary Service, a mobile service treating large animals, as well as an Emergency Clinic with a staff of 15 and more than 10,000 repeat customers. Dr. Tim VanDerPloeg is another veterinarian using USDA¡¯s assistance to expand rural veterinary services. VanDerPloeg will open Veterinary Center of Somerset, in Kentucky, soon. Pulaski County, where the clinic will be located, is the third largest cattle county in the state of Kentucky.? The clinic will have a 2,300-square-foot large animal facility in addition to the 3,400-square-foot small animal facility. ¡°Although recipients of the loan repayment assistance are only to commit to three years of veterinary service in a designated shortage area, veterinarians like Bowes and VanDerPloeg suggest that the impacts from this funding and connections to their service areas go well beyond three years,¡± said Gary Sherman, VMLRP national program leader with NIFA. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

He¡¯s committed to moving the program forward and addressing those needs.? ¡°The challenge is to re-strengthen and build us back to what we used to be.¡± Dr. Shere will bring his enthusiasm for learning to his new role.? While he already has many degrees ¨C B.S. in Biology and Chemistry, M.S. in Education with a minor in counseling, doctorate in Veterinary Medicine, and Ph.Ds in both Poultry Science and Microbiology ¨C Dr. Shere wants to continue to be a lifetime learner.? ¡°There¡¯s always new knowledge out there, and you can always acquire more.? It¡¯s just fascinating to know how much you won¡¯t ever know!¡± But what brought him to the veterinary field was his love of caring for animals.? As a child, he would often take wounded animals home to take care of, and Dr. Shere said his mother ¡°never knew what she would find in [his] top dresser drawer.¡±? A few years later, he made the conscious decision to become a veterinarian when dealing with his family¡¯s German Shepard puppy, which had become increasingly ill.? On a Friday evening, the puppy had a violent seizure.? The family vet said he was closing his office for the day, and recommended that the animal be euthanized on Monday morning if it was still alive.? Dr. Shere¡¯s father was left in a terrible position, and decided to put the animal out of its misery that night.? While heartbreaking, it prompted Dr. Shere to resolve that after becoming a veterinarian himself, he would always go and help an animal if he was called ¨C ¡°So when I was in practice, if anyone called me, I would go, no matter what the time.¡±? And he¡¯s kept that vow in the years since graduating vet school.

"Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service¡¯s Livestock and Poultry Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 15,  USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Purdue University have developed a series of training videos that illustrate proper sanitation assessment techniques to evaluate shell egg processing equipment. While the practices in these videos are in facilities that have USDA grading, they are valuable for any shell egg facility wishing to learn more about good sanitation techniques. To support emerging needs across the egg industry in recent years, AMS reviewed its internal procedures to assess equipment sanitation in shell egg processing plants. The agency visited over 30 shell egg processing facilities across the country to assess equipment sanitation and consistency. In order to document and share findings, AMS partnered with Purdue and ARS to develop this educational video series. The videos take the viewer through each phase of shell egg processing and explain how to inspect each component of the facility for sanitation effectiveness. The 18 videos are a great resource for shell egg processing facilities by illustrating what clean machines and facilities should look like prior to daily verification by USDA grading personnel.

"Senior Public Health Advisor, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service; and  Dr. Eileen Thacker, Center Director, United States National Poultry Research Center, USDA   Agricultural Research Service in  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Nov 15,  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on January 26, that it was going to require meat and poultry processing plants to have a science-based Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) food inspection system put into place. HACCP is a food production, storage, and distribution monitoring system for identification and control of associated health hazards using definitive scientific tests. Its purpose is to prevent contamination of food products during processing. USDA photo. Today kicked off ¡°Get Smart about Antibiotics¡± week in the United States and the World Health Organization¡¯s World Antibiotic Awareness Week in . During this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its other federal partners want to remind families and communities about the importance of responsible antibiotic use in both humans and animals, to help reduce the development of resistant bacteria. This week, we also celebrate the 20th anniversary of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS).? Through NARMS, USDA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborate on everything relating to antimicrobial resistant bacteria.? ?Since , USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) have been active participants in this combined federal surveillance program. So, what is antimicrobial resistance?? As you might recall, in , Dr. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug that revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections. In the years following, penicillin and the discovery and therapeutic use of other antibiotics, we have relied on antibiotics to treat and cure a variety of illnesses - in both humans and animals, across the globe. The use of these drugs has aided in the development of resistant strains of bacteria. Unfortunately, this development means that some previously treatable forms of bacterial infections are now resistant to the antibiotics that were designed to treat them. It is estimated that the decrease in effectiveness of antibiotics, results in more than two million U.S. cases of antibiotic resistant infections, annually. Some of these types of infections might require longer hospital stays and are more costly to treat successfully.? As scientists, we call this problem antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ?Dr. Fleming even raised this concern in after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of penicillin.? The AMR threat in humans and animals is becoming an increasing problem and requires the adoption of a One Health approach. ?This approach is founded on principles that recognize that the health of people and populations are linked to the health of animals and environments. For example, antibiotics are used in food-producing animals to prevent illness, limit the spread of infections in a herd or flock, and treat diseases. ?Because antibiotics are administered to animals, food products derived from them can serve as a vehicle for the movement of resistant bacteria to humans, just as antibiotics administered to people can affect the environment, including the environment of animals. The One Health approach brings together the expertise of physicians, veterinarians, environmental scientists, and other public health professionals so that problems can be identified and actionable solutions are developed that can minimize the emergence and spread of AMR. World Antibiotics Awareness Week USDA is uniquely positioned to contribute to the body of knowledge about resistant bacteria through the collaboration and ongoing work of experts both within and outside of the Department. For the last 20 years, ARS and FSIS have partnered alongside FDA and CDC to collect and define AMR bacteria in meat and poultry products. Through the NARMS program, ARS and FSIS continually monitor changes in AMR bacteria from animal meat through the FSIS regulatory testing program and from animals through the new cecal sampling surveillance program. ?The sampling results from these two programs help to identify new or changing resistant bacterial patterns and show comparisons between bacteria found in animals used for food and bacteria important in human medicine. This information is critically essential for scientists to understand how resistant bacteria emerge and spread. In , USDA in collaboration with its public health partners began using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to further characterize AMR bacteria in real-time. WGS is a process that can determine the DNA sequence of bacteria collected from food animal samples. This method allows scientists to understand similarities and differences between bacteria with greater detail than ever before. The information gained from WGS helps USDA and NARMS monitor AMR bacteria with more accuracy and to identify more specifically the types of bacteria that cause foodborne illness. Despite USDA¡¯s long history of significant activities and investments in AMR, including its strong twenty years of NARMS collaboration as well as USDAs¡¯ own AMR Action Plan (, 322 ); a considerable amount of work remains to be done to address knowledge gaps in AMR and for further strengthen the current programs. To achieve the greatest public health impact, USDA must continue to coordinate and leverage expertise across many areas. And to ensure that effectiveness of antibiotics is preserved for treating both people and animals and that it is extended to future generations, USDA, other federal agencies, industry, and academic partners are working together to better understand the role of animal production environments in the development and spread of AMR bacteria.?

The project included adding vegetation to eroding stream banks. (U.S. Forest Service) I am proud to announce that we exceeded our ecological restoration goals for Fiscal Year . This was no small feat. A lot of great people across the U.S. Forest Service worked hard to make it a reality. We did substantial homework and planning, and then based on that we made strategic investments across all agency programs to help us create resilient forests, grasslands and watersheds while sustaining communities. This work reduced the wildland fire threats to communities and firefighters and minimized the risk of forest pests and climate change, while supporting American jobs and rural economies. That is a fantastic combination. The results of this hard work are nothing short of amazing.? The projects we carried out lessened the threats to communities by reducing hazardous fuels on 1.7 million acres in the wildland urban interface, sustained or restored watershed conditions on 2.9 million acres and resulted in 2.8 billion board feet of timber volume sold. Impressively, we did all this despite simultaneously facing a government shutdown, as well as rising costs of fire-fighting that drain resources from our work across all program areas. On a personal level, these accomplishments reflect how much members of our Forest Service community are committed to improving the forests and grasslands that have been entrusted to us by the American people.

"DVM, Chief Veterinary Officer of the United States, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Dr. Kis Robertson-Hale, Chief Public Health Veterinarian of the United States, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Animals  Apr 27,  April 30 is World Veterinary Day: a day to celebrate veterinarians, their work and their impact. Although the importance of veterinarians is hardly a secret, people often forget that veterinarians¡¯ work goes beyond clinical care of animals. USDA employs more veterinarians than any other department in the federal government, with positions located across the nation and associated territories. The breadth of roles that veterinarians fill at USDA illustrates their versatility. Veterinary epidemiologist, emergency responder, laboratory diagnostician, and public health veterinarian are just some of the roles that USDA veterinarians fill every day. Resilience is the theme of this year¡¯s World Veterinary Day. From USDA¡¯s perspective, there could not be a more appropriate theme. From responding to the COVID-19 pandemic to inspecting livestock and poultry slaughter facilities to combating animal health threats like the recent detections of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, USDA veterinarians are on the frontlines protecting public health and animal health every day. Their contributions in both areas preserve an essential resource: a food supply that is both dependable and safe. As a nation, we can¡¯t be resilient¡ªin all senses of the word¡ªwithout that. Beyond ensuring a safe and dependable food supply, preparedness is key to staying resilient in the face of animal or human health threats. USDA works with state and tribal partners and other federal agencies in a collaborative effort known as One Health to protect animals, people, and the environment, which are all connected. The interplay of humans, animals, and the natural world affects diseases in animals and humans, and what we learn could help prevent or limit the next outbreak of diseases transmitted from animals to people, or even the next global pandemic. USDA veterinarians play a key role in the One Health approach. USDA veterinarians protect Americans and their animals every day. They make sure our country has a safe and dependable food supply and is prepared for whatever animal or human diseases may come. If you love agriculture and public health and are dedicated to helping your nation, we encourage you to explore opportunities at USDA.

"Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Mar 14,  Plan for spring cleaning, a checklist for a food safe pantry and fridge. The refrigerator and pantry are where most people store their food. But these storage areas may also be one of the less frequently cleaned places in your home, which could be hazardous to your health. The refrigerator is one of the most important pieces of equipment in the kitchen. Without it, our food would spoil and could make us sick. Refrigerators should be set to maintain a temperature between 34¡ã and 40¡ãF to preserve our foods. Setting the refrigerator temperature too low will cause your refrigerator to work overtime and could also freeze some of your foods. Many of today¡¯s advanced refrigerators have built-in thermostats that measure their internal temperature. If your fridge does not have a built-in thermostat, you should keep an appliance thermometer inside in a visible place to monitor the temperature. Here are some tips to make your fridge (and your home) more healthy and safe:  Clean spills immediately ¨C Clean surfaces thoroughly with warm, soapy water; then rinse. Do not use solvent cleaning agents or abrasives, as these may allow chemical fumes/tastes into your food and ice cubes and make them unsafe to eat.  Store leftovers safely ¨C Throw out perishable foods that have spoiled and no longer can be eaten. Leftovers like meatloaf, pizza or casseroles shouldn¡¯t be left in the refrigerator more than four days. Refrigerate raw poultry and ground meats for no more than one to two days.  Clean the exterior ¨C Keep your refrigerator free of dust and lint. Clean the condenser coil several times a year with a brush or vacuum cleaner to remove dirt, lint or other accumulations to ensure efficiency and maintain proper temperature. Cleaning your pantry will save you money by keeping you aware of what you have and help you avoid a pantry insect infestation. It will also ensure your foods are safe to consume. Here are some tips for a clean, bug-free pantry:  Check your cans ¨C Discard cans that are leaking, rusted, bulging or badly dented. Never use food from cracked jars, jars with loose or bulging lids, or any container that spurts liquid when you open it.  Throw out any food you suspect is spoiled ¨C Never taste food to determine its safety. Wipe off sticky containers, along with crumbs and spills on your pantry shelves with all-purpose cleaner, vinegar, or warm soap and water.  Check the dates on your foods ¨C ¡°USE by¡± date indicates that perishable products should be consumed by the date listed on the package or discarded once the date has passed. ¡°BEST if Used By¡± date informs shoppers that after the specified date, the shelf-stable product is safe to use or consume, but has exceeded the window of its optimal taste or performance. High-acid canned food such as tomatoes, grapefruit and pineapple have a shelf life of 12 to 18 months beyond their listed dates. Low-acid canned food such as meat, poultry, fish and most vegetables can be kept for two to five years beyond their listed dates ¡ª if the can remains in good condition and has been stored in a cool, clean and dry place. If you have questions about storage times for food or beverages, we recommend downloading our smartphone and tablet application, the FoodKeeper. With more than 150,000 downloads for Android and iOS smartphones, the FoodKeeper is quickly establishing itself as the quick reference go-to guide for safe food storage and preparation.

"White House Fellow in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 02,  A local WIC staff member holds her sleeping baby as she listens to the peer counseling instructor. March is Women¡¯s History month, a time when we highlight everything woman.? In the midst of farming and biofuels, research and forestry would you believe that the USDA also finds time to promote breastfeeding?? The answer is absolutely!? You already know that the agency supports a myriad of nutrition programs to help make America¡¯s children healthy and hunger-free.? Research has shown that there is no better food than breast milk for a baby¡¯s first year of life. Breastfeeding provides many health, nutritional, economical and emotional benefits to mother and baby. Since a major goal of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) Program is to improve the nutritional status of infants, WIC mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their infants. WIC promotes breastfeeding to all pregnant women as the optimal infant feeding choice, unless medically contraindicated.? So what exactly is WIC doing to support breastfeeding?? The answer is a lot! WIC moms and babies who exclusively breastfeed receive an enhanced food package for a longer duration than non-breastfeeding mothers. Exclusively breastfed babies do not receive formula in their package. Breastfeeding moms can receive breast pumps, breast shells, and other nursing supplies to encourage increased initiation and duration of breastfeeding. WIC mom¡¯s who breastfeed receive support through counseling, educational materials, and peer support from fellow WIC moms that have breastfed their babies. We recognize that the food package alone is not enough to change behaviors.? Mother¡¯s need support education, and encouragement to breastfeed.? WIC clinics provide peer counselors, women who can personally relate to other WIC moms, to help support breastfeeding.? Some WIC clinics also provide education to fathers and grandmothers as we recognize that they play a crucial role in a mother¡¯s decision to breastfeed. USDA doesn¡¯t just promote breastfeeding for the clients it serves; we are helping to support women who choose to breastfeed when they return to work at USDA as well.? The Nursing Mother¡¯s Working Group is committed to investigating whether USDA is currently meeting the needs and requirements of its new and expectant mothers who wish to continue lactation after they return to the office.? A Department-wide effort is underway to assess the current state of the USDA Nursing Mother¡¯s Program and identify where improvements need to be made.? The USDA hopes to be a leader in the Federal Government in changing the culture of the workplace to support employees who are devoted to their families. USDA is in the midst of updating its Loving Support makes Breastfeeding Work campaign. This is a nationwide social marketing campaign to encourage the initiation and duration of breastfeeding for all women. Stay tuned for events leading up to World Breastfeeding Week in August.

"USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  Jun 20,  Josepha preparing amaranth greens for a recent dinner put together by some of our gardeners from Burundi. Every month, USDA shares the story of a woman in agriculture who is leading the industry and helping other women succeed along the way. In honor of World Refugee Day, this month we hear from Josepha Ntakirutimana, a refugee from Rwanda who settled in Tucson, Arizona in . Josepha is now an invaluable part of the Tucson New Roots Program which brings together refugees and their community around production and nutrition education activities. Josepha¡¯s journey to Tucson is a long one ¨C as for any refugee, the memories are sometimes painful. When she was a girl, at the age of 12, Josepha started helping her mom at a local farm before school. Later, she worked on a farm during school holidays and, when she was married, her family had a small plot in town where they could grow vegetables and grains to help reduce food costs. After the war, when she left Rwanda and entered into a refugee camp in Malawi, agriculture continued to help her and her family survive. There wasn¡¯t enough food but she was able to start a garden and grew amaranth, squash, and carrots. Being able to carry out this activity in the refugee camp was a welcome change of pace to the camp life, which was hard and full of uncertainty. Gardening also allows for refugees to have access to fresh food, which is welcomed in refugee camps, where food is very limited in amounts and variety.  Now, Josepha considers it a ¡®great joy of living¡¯ to be able to garden and grow her own vegetables in her new home of Tucson. Agriculture is a thread that connects Josepha¡¯s past, present, and future ¨C and is a veritable lifeline. Her refugee story is a real inspiration. Like all the refugees the IRC works to help resettle in the U.S,. she is a survivor, and we are honored to be working with her to help refugees to start a new life in her community. The IRC has 29 offices and helps? 6,000 - 10,000 new arrivals each year in acclimating to their new communities. Over the past 10 years, the IRC has reshaped expectations for nutritional well-being among its refugee clients, and has developed a multifaceted food security and agriculture program called ¡°New Roots"" to increase the supply of and demand for fresh, culturally appropriate foods within immigrant and refugee communities To learn more about their work please visit www.rescue.org/ and follow on twitter at @theIRC. 1. Josepha, can you share your story with us? As a refugee, what was your journey to the United States like? I was a nurse for 21 years in Rwanda. In , there was a genocide in Rwanda. My husband, four children and I were displaced from southern Rwanda to western Rwanda. There I worked as a nurse at a Hospital with a humanitarian aid organization and my husband worked as an interpreter. Because the organizations trusted us, our coworkers became jealous and falsely accused my husband of participating in the genocide. My husband was summoned to the police station and put in jail. He was jailed in prison in southern Rwanda, where he spent nine years. I consider agriculture to be a very important aid during this tough time in my life. Alongside my career, I was practicing agriculture to be able to feed my children and be able to bring biweekly food to my husband in prison. My husband was freed from jail in , but we fled our country so he would not be detained again. We traveled to Malawi and ended up in a refugee camp. It was my first time outside of my country and it felt like going to hell. I was depressed and could not see my future. Much of the food was spoiled, but I fed my family beans, which were still safe to eat. To feed my family, I would ration the beans to the last month. Eventually, I started a garden of amaranth and squash and would mix the beans with the squash to make them last. After a few years, we moved to another refugee camp in Malawi where I could see people I knew from Rwanda. My mind was renewed. I started to go to school to learn English, tailoring, computer skills and counseling. To support my family, I worked in a tailoring shop. After getting a counseling certificate, I became a school counselor and started a group for unaccompanied minors. I created projects to help them make money while encouraging them to stay in school. After nine years in refugee camps, my family resettled in Tucson, Arizona. Fortunately, after 5 months my husband and I found caregiver jobs and I began interpreting for the IRC. Eventually, I became a Community Well-being Promoter and was able to combine my interpretation skills and my passion for food and agriculture. 2. How has your connection to agriculture changed depending on the country in which you live? The biggest difference is in climate ¨C the desert here is dry and hot ¨C Rwanda is dry and humid. Here there¡¯s use of irrigation systems, but in my native country, we depend only on rain.? I was able to raise animals for compost, but I am not allowed to do that here.? There are many plants that are new to me and each has its own season with new tastes, new textures. 3. What is the New Roots Program? The New Roots program helps refugees to become involved in agriculture and to grow their own food. We connect interested refugees to community garden space and provide them with seeds and other resources. We host trainings to help gardeners transfer their agricultural knowledge to the particular climate of the Sonoran Desert. We also enroll clients in public benefits (such as SNAP and WIC) upon arrival, and we implement a 3-module nutrition education with families in need. 4. Have you experienced culture shock? The trip to the United States was difficult; it was my first time flying. We were served new food in flight.? English was a problem because of the difference in pronunciation. My family thought the United States was cold but when we arrived in Tucson at night it was still 100¡ã F when we got off the plane. I had hoped to continue my nursing and counseling education in the U.S., but the cost of living is too high, making it unaffordable to also pay for my education.? Finding work is difficult in a new country and bringing in an income was my first priority.? 5. From which communities do you receive the most support and what have you learned from them that is the most valuable to you? Most of my support has come from International Rescue Committee and from an elderly Caucasian woman whom I met soon after arriving in Tucson.? We have become as close as mother and daughter and from her I can always receive help and advice. 6. Who are your role models? My mother, who just died in Rwanda, was a hard-worker and a confident lady who introduced me to agriculture.? I have her to thank for my love of agriculture. 7. Where do you see yourself in 5, 10, 20 years; how to get there? In five years, I hope to have developed my back yard into a large garden to raise enough food to feed my family with more that I can sell.? In ten years, I hope to have the mortgage on my home paid off.? In twenty years, I hope to be retired and able to enjoy my garden and my grandchildren. 8. What advice for young women interested in agriculture? Share experiences with others, listen to others and share knowledge, never give up their dreams, no matter what they aspire to be in this world. 9. What¡¯s best advice you receive from someone? To trust in myself. Learning doesn¡¯t stop: continue to learn in different ways as long as you are alive. To learn more and connect with other women leaders in agriculture across the country, we encourage you to visit?

Seventy years ago, when Nat ¡°King¡± Cole first regaled us about roasted chestnuts in The Christmas Song, not many Americans could actually enjoy the treat because American chestnut trees were in dire straits. The predominant tree in Eastern American forests was nearing the tail end of a 50-year blight that killed an astonishing three to five billion trees, making the species functionally extinct. Now, however, researchers supported by USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) are working to restore the American chestnut and may be only a few years away from bringing back the iconic tree.  Alexandra Wilson, National Institute of Food and Agriculture  Posted in  Research and Science  May 10,   5 Responses",What are some ways that agricultural research can help restore and bring back functionally extinct species?,"1. Developing disease-resistant varieties through breeding programs, such as the American chestnut's blight-resistant trees. 2.

"Pacific Southwest Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 08,  Barbara C. Weber in as director of the U.S. Forest Service¡¯s Pacific Southwest Research Station. (Photo courtesy Barbara C. Weber) As the oldest of 11 children, Barbara C. Weber is accustomed to being the ¡°first.¡± With top family ranking comes responsibility, and Weber had plenty of it. Growing up on her family¡¯s 160-acre dairy farm in Bloomington, Wis., Weber, along with her siblings, helped clean the barn, pick up eggs and tend to the animals.? Her innate curiosity and connection to nature led to her love of science. She was the first in her family to go to college, graduating from Viterbo College, a women¡¯s school in LaCrosse, Wis., with a degree in biology. She would go on to earn a master¡¯s degree in entomology at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and a doctorate in zoology from Southern Illinois University. Few women ranked among the agency¡¯s scientific community when Weber joined in . She became the first woman scientist at the North Central Research Station¡ªwhich later became the Northern Research Station. But being first had its challenges. In , Jackie Robertson, a research entomologist at the Pacific Southwest Research Station became the first to head a research project. Five years later, Weber followed suit.

For these reasons and more, America¡¯s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. Texas Producer Changes his Mind about Leaving the Farm Jonathan Cobb had made up his mind. He was leaving the farm. ¡°I was disillusioned with farming in general because we were just pushing long days and chasing acres and it didn¡¯t seem like there was very much reward,¡± Cobb said. ¡°That quality of life was not very good. My wife was having to work a lot of hours full time and really support the family. Twenty-five hundred acres really didn¡¯t support two families, and we weren¡¯t living extravagant lifestyles by any means.¡± Then came the drought of . ¡°I thought, maybe this is a sign from God ¨C maybe we shouldn¡¯t be farming. Maybe we should move on to something else,¡¯¡± Cobb said. ¡°I was looking into moving down to Austin, Texas and being involved in some urban farming setups.¡± In time, he and his wife Kaylyn put their house on the market and prepared to move, abandoning a century-old tradition of Cobb family farming. Using diverse cover crops and diverse animal grazing, the Cobbs are building soil health on their farm. Photo: Ron Nichols. Shortly after making that painful decision, Cobb¡¯s father asked him to stop by and review some soil test results that had just arrived at USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service¡¯s office in Temple, Texas. But before he could complete the chore, Cobb found himself ""trapped"" in a soil health workshop featuring NRCS¡¯ Ray Archuleta and Willie Durham. Too polite to leave, he took a seat on the front row. Within minutes, Cobb was entranced by what he was hearing from the presenters and the presentation he was seeing with his own eyes. What he heard that morning from the soil health presenters rekindled a passion and love that conventional agriculture had nearly extinguished. ¡°By the end of the day I knew I was going to stay and be a part of the paradigm shift.¡± Cobb said. Since that fateful day, the Cobb¡¯s have downsized their farm from 2,500 acres to 450 and transitioned from row crops to cover crops with multi-species livestock grazing systems. ¡°We planted over a thousand acres of cover crops the very next year, got rid of all of the tillage equipment, and just dove in,¡± he says.? Cobb admits his farming operation is still evolving, but improving soil health remains the central goal. ¡°One very high priority is to help with the soil and building up the soil and the carbon in the soil,¡± he says. ¡°We will probably make thousands of mistakes but we¡¯ll learn along the way.¡± Whatever happens, he says, ¡°The goal is to build the soil.¡± While Cobb¡¯s new business model hasn¡¯t fully evolved, he and his family are already reaping some of the intrinsic rewards he fondly remembered as a child growing up on the farm ¨C like enjoying the smell of blooming clover in the evening and watching the sun rise on a warm summer day. ¡°If we can make a living and stay here then we couldn¡¯t ask for anything more,¡± he says.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 30,   NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we¡¯ve been featuring the stories of America¡¯s Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for. From laying the foundation for the next generation of farmers putting down roots in rural America, supporting the fruit and vegetable growers who are helping to build healthier communities, bolstering new markets for the products of agricultural innovation, to harvesting renewable energy that is made in Rural America, with USDA¡¯s support our farmers are yielding strong results for every American. This blog focuses on two heroes of a different kind of harvest ¨C clean, renewable energy that is . I spent some time in Montana earlier this month to attend the Harvesting Clean Energy conference in Billings. We talked about options for continuing to support clean energy development, whether it's bio-based, geothermal, solar, or wind ¨C and how rural America fits in to the picture of clean energy development. Our Rural Energy for America Program was, unsurprisingly, a key focus by the participants. Having been reauthorized by the recent Farm Bill, Congress put REAP in a position to have very real impact on clean energy development in our rural communities. If properly leveraged with other programs, both private and public, and investment from the private sector ¨C the funding made available by Congress could conceivably have a billion-dollar impact on clean energy development in our nation. Red Lodge Ales owner Sam Hoffmann (middle) explains his brewery¡¯s thermal solar heating system to Montana State Director Janelle Gustafson (l) and Deputy Under Secretary Lillian Salerno (r). Hoffmann used the Rural Energy for America Program to purchase and install the thermal system. What strikes me the most is, how many of the projects to this point have been implemented. Rather than just the large complexes ¨C which certainly have their place in the overall picture ¨C rural America has responded by implementing small-scale projects, often at an individual business level, that have had noteworthy impact on the energy structure in their communities. While in Montana, I was able to see first-hand how these small scale projects have made a positive change on not just the carbon footprint and energy consumption of rural small businesses, but on their operational bottom line. I visited Red Lodge, Montana, a small community southwest of Billings that acts as a gateway in to Yellowstone National Park via the Beartooth Highway. Two particular businesses stood out for me, the Yodeler Motel, and Red Lodge Ales. Both companies had made investments in their businesses through the Rural Energy for America Program, and done so on a relatively small scale ¨C yet had seen a direct and positive impact on their operations due to the cost savings from the renewable energy sources. Harnessing the sun's radiant thermal energy to heat water, both the Yodeler and Red Lodge Ales have utilized the water in different ways to benefit their businesses. The Yodeler uses the heated water in their boiler to heat the rooms and common areas of the historic motel on the south end of Red Lodge. Mac Dean of the Yodeler Motel in Red Lodge, Mont. explains the thermal transfer system that supplies the motel's boiler with heated water, providing warmth to the Yodeler's rooms and common areas. Red Lodge Ales takes the pre-heated water, and superheats it to clean their brewing tanks, as well as maintain the necessary heat to brew their beer. It's a prime example of two different businesses using similar technology to harvest the abundant, clean, and free energy around us to benefit not only the businesses themselves ¨C and their bottom line ¨C but to benefit their community and the environment as a whole. I'm proud that USDA Rural Development could play a role in that.  Category/Topic:  Rural  Tags:  harvest heroes  Rural Development  Rural Energy for America Program","""What are some ways in which small-scale renewable energy projects can benefit rural businesses and communities?""","Implementing small-scale renewable energy projects, such as harnessing solar thermal energy to heat water, can have a direct and positive impact on rural businesses and communities by reducing their carbon footprint and energy consumption, while also providing cost savings that can be reinvested in the business. These projects can benefit individual businesses, such as breweries like Red Lodge Ales, and motels like the Yodeler Motel, by using pre-heated water to clean equipment or heat rooms, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing expenses. Furthermore, these small-scale projects can contribute to the overall energy structure in rural communities, making them more sustainable and environmentally friendly."

"Deputy Secretary in  USDA Results  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Initiatives  Mar 08,  Rossie Fisher, co-owner of Brookview Farm in Manakin-Sabot, VA. March 8 is International Women's Day. Today, March 8th, is International Women¡¯s Day. What better day to recognize the incredible achievements of women in agriculture? Women have always played a key role on the farm or ranch. Traditionally, women often kept the books and ensured the solvency of the business while men ran the day-to-day production operation. That is still the case in many households, but these days, we are seeing more and more women take a lead role in farm operations as well. In ¨C the year of USDA¡¯s most recent agricultural census ¨C some 30 percent of farm operators in the U.S. were women. That¡¯s a 19 percent increase over the census. Fourteen percent of U.S. farms listed women as the principal operator in , meaning that women made the day-to-day decisions on the farm. (Women listed as farm operators, rather than principal operators, likely run the farm along with a partner or spouse). That¡¯s a 24 percent increase over . Individual states are showing even more involvement of women in farming. Arizona and New Hampshire have the greatest number of farms whose principal operator is a woman; one out of three New Hampshire farms is run by a woman, more than twice the national average. We know that American agriculture is constantly innovating to meet new demands. Women are part of a new wave of innovation in the industry. Women-operated farms tend to be very diverse, producing more vegetables, fruit and nuts, horticultural crops, poultry and sheep or goats than male-operated farms. They are also smaller on average, suggesting that they may engage in more direct-to-consumer sales or sell to local grocers, restaurants, or institutions. These strategies require new, creative business models and innovative production methods. And women are leading the way. As a historically disadvantaged group, women face unique challenges entering agriculture. I¡¯m proud of USDA¡¯s efforts to meet the needs of women farmers through training and business planning programs, mentorship opportunities, support for value-added product development, and our efforts to build strong local food systems through USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative. You can learn more about USDA¡¯s support for women in agriculture by searching for projects on the KYF Compass Map using the search term ¡°women.¡± Today, let¡¯s all take some time to thank women for their hard work on farms, ranches and in rural communities.

For these reasons and more, America¡¯s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. A towering, craggy McIntosh apple tree in the center of the orchard at Red Apple Farm in Phillipston, Massachusetts, has weathered 113 winters, borne many tons of crisp, tart apples and fed generations of customers. Planted in , it¡¯s the oldest commercially planted McIntosh tree in New England and possibly the country. Thanks to care by generations of the Rose family, that ancient apple tree still produces fruit today. Al Rose and his wife Nancy, who operate the fourth-generation farm, have introduced an innovative, modern growing system just a stone¡¯s throw from the century McIntosh. To ensure success in an area that sees its share of dry summers, the Roses sought the help of USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). ¡°It may be challenging, but I think we¡¯ve got a natural environment that¡¯s conducive to growing great apples,¡± said Al Rose. ¡°We have cold nights for a good part of the growing season, which are great for the color of the apples. Fall without apples in New England just wouldn¡¯t be the same.¡± A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ¡°We¡¯re at one of the highest elevations for orchards in New England ¨C 1,250 feet,¡± said Rose, standing in the orchard on a windy day. ¡°We have a wind turbine that¡¯s been cranking today. Between that and our solar panels, we¡¯re a red farm and a ¡®green¡¯ farm.¡± Red Apple Farm is protected under the state Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) program. ?Through a state grant program to help the viability of APR farms, Rose developed a business plan that called for planting an acre of trees in a new trellis system. ¡°We¡¯re not creating more land here; we have to be more productive on the land that we do have,¡± explained Rose. The ¡°fruit wall¡± is small trees, shallow-rooted and spaced as close as a foot apart. ¡°It¡¯s the most productive way and, from a cost standpoint, it¡¯s easier to maintain,¡± said Rose. ¡°But, to do that, you have to have a pond in place.¡± So, Rose reached out to NRCS for help with irrigation. ¡°I know they have the technical expertise to do it right and give us advice,¡± said Rose, who also got financial help through the federal Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program. Dave Bacon, NRCS Soil Conservationist, has been assisting Red Apple Farm for more than a decade. He explained that, in Massachusetts, the AMA program is used for drought mitigation. ¡°We didn¡¯t want to have an acre¡¯s worth of apple trees fail because there was no irrigation water available,¡± said Bacon. Al Rose stands near the McIntosh tree, planted in . Bacon explained that soil indicated that there was adequate ground water to create a pond, a more reliable water source than drilling a well. With well drilling, there is a risk that there won¡¯t be enough water to meet the plants¡¯ needs.? A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ¡°As we slowly change to the newer high production, higher density plantings, it¡¯s going to make us a lot more successful for the current generation and future generations,¡± said Rose. ¡°If you want to do something right, get the experts involved,¡± said Rose.? ¡°NRCS has experts; they know how to do it and they know how to do it right.

"Associate Deputy Administrator for APHIS Animal Care in  Animals  Plants  Jul 14,  Dr. Morgan, pictured here with her horse, Belle, knew at a young age that she wanted to be a veterinarian when, on a road trip with her parents, she saw the horses in Louisville and Lexington. Hello, I¡¯m Dr. Andrea (Andy) Morgan, Associate Deputy Administrator of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)¡¯s Animal Care (AC) program. In , when I hadn¡¯t been out of vet school long and was working at a small animal practice, I got ahold of a brochure about APHIS¡¯ Public Veterinary Practice Career Program. I was interested in working not just with small animals but with other animals, too¡ªexotic animals and horses, to name a few. So I joined APHIS that year, and here I am, still working for the agency 26 years and many important experiences later. My current position involves a lot of strategic planning and working within the program to find ways USDA can be more effective with Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act inspections. Before I joined the AC program, I held a number of positions in APHIS¡¯ Veterinary Services. I served as National Incident Commander for the U.S. response to an Exotic Newcastle Disease outbreak and National Coordinator for the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance program. The most memorable experience I¡¯ve had at APHIS was ensuring the U.S. Equestrian Team horses could travel to the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. An unidentified equine illness hit New England that year before all of the ates. The European Union (EU) Commission wanted to ban the entry of all U.S. horses into EU Member States. I was a staff vet with APHIS¡¯ National Center for Import/Export, and I had to assure the EU that none of the Equestrian Team horses had been affected by the outbreak. Dr. Morgan shares her insights and perspectives with APHIS employees. For several hours, my EU counterpart Dr. Bernard Van Goethem and I were on the phone and faxing proposals back and forth. Keep in mind this was before e-mail was widely used. We were just two vets, hashing it out across the ocean. Dr. Van Goethem would share the proposals with EU Member States¡¯ Chief Veterinary Officers and get back to me. Eventually, we all agreed on a proposal. I was especially glad to learn that Irish, one of the horses that wouldn¡¯t have made it to Spain without those efforts, won the Olympic bronze medal in show jumping. It¡¯s the coolest thing to negotiate on behalf of the United States, or to make things happen in any number of ways when there¡¯s a problem to solve. Are there challenges when working as a public veterinarian? Always. But it¡¯s like swimming¡ªthere are no standard operating procedures¡ªyou have to just dive in. I¡¯ve learned a lot about myself and my core values in my time at APHIS. This is my legacy.

The Act, and accompanying regulations developed by APHIS, set Federal standards of care for animals that are bred at the wholesale level, used in research, transported commercially, or exhibited to the public.? Under the law, APHIS has the authority and obligation to confiscate any AWA-regulated animal that is in a condition of unrelieved suffering. When APHIS inspectors identify a suffering animal, they intervene quickly on its behalf and make sure the animal gets the care it needs.? First, inspectors will clearly explain to the owner what needs to be done, such as requiring the facility¡¯s veterinarian to tend to an injury or health issue, and then set a short deadline ¡ª usually 24 hours ¡ª for when corrective action must be taken. ?Under the AWA, if proper care is not provided by the deadline, APHIS must ensure that the animal is taken to a facility where it will receive humane care according to Federal standards.

Anchored by a strong foundation of market and consumer research and analysis, the USPB domestic and international potato marketing programs include:?advertising, nutrition science, public relations, retail and foodservice marketing, and issues management.?Whether the potato is grown for fresh, frozen, chip, dehydrated or seed use, the USPB is dedicated to positioning potatoes as a nutrition powerhouse¡ªtruly, goodness unearthed.? And all of these efforts mean more economic growth and market viability for American potato farmers. For Fiscal Year (July ¨C June ), U.S. potato exports were a record $1.6 billion, an increase of 4% over FY12 The volume of exports increased 4% to 1,561,896 metric tons, or 66 million hundredweight at the fresh weight equivalent The volume of U.S. exports has increased 26% over the past five marketing years, led by a 62% increase in fresh, a 36% increase in dehydrated and a 17% increase in frozen For the first six months of FY14, the volume of exports of frozen products is up 2%, dehydrated is up 10% and fresh is up 2% The National Mango Board¡¯s (NMB) mission is to increase the demand for fresh mangos in the U.S. by conducting promotion, market and production research. The NMB accomplishes this through three core programs: marketing, research and industry relations. Understanding consumer purchasing behaviors is key to increasing mango consumption in the U.S. The NMB conducts ongoing consumer research to explore consumer awareness, knowledge about mangos, buying habits, barriers to purchase and many other facets of consumer attitudes relative to mangos. ?Results from their consumer research help create, support and guide marketing efforts and messages to increase mango demand. Demand is the most direct and practical way to monitor consumer purchasing behavior since it reflects all of the conditions impacting buying decisions. Most of the changes in the demand for mangos come from attracting new households to buy (market penetration) and far less in changing the number of mangos purchased (market intensity) per buyer. With NMB programs, market penetration increased from under 3% in to over 13% in . Mango availability per capita has increased 53% since to an estimated 2.87 pounds per year in . This means that increased mango sales are related to more consumers perceiving mangos as an option, and much of this is due to NMB¡¯s work.? Through market penetration more consumers are likely to make mangos a routine part of their diets.? By providing promotional information to increase consumer awareness of the fruit, NMB¡¯s efforts convince more potential customers to give them a try. Whether engaging in consumer research, nutrition education or advertising, ag promotion groups help America¡¯s farmers and agribusinesses navigate through marketing challenges, opening doors to new markets and broadening our food options. Results from consumer research conducted by the National Mango Board helps create, support and guide marketing efforts and messages to increase mango demand. Increased consumer demand means economic viability for mango producers, importers and businesses.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 28,  Dianilda Rodriguez of GR Management Corp., Arlene Zambrana from USDA Rural Development, and Maria Rodriquez-Collazo of PathStone stand in front of the completed Alturas de Casta?er housing complex in Puerto Rico. In the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico, lies Alturas de Casta?er, a small, mountainous community that is home to 24 agricultores and their families. The agricultores - or farm workers - work hard year-round to produce coffee, bananas, root vegetables and citrus fruits that are then sold in local markets and to area restaurants. Before coming to the community of Alturas de Casta?er, many families lived in cramped conditions, sometimes with two or three other families.? Conditions were unsanitary and children were constantly sick.? Some homes did not even have roofs, and residents suffered dangerous exposure to the natural elements, including torrential rains during hurricane season. Alturas de Casta?er resident Maria Rodriguez and her husband recall renting a house that they could barely afford. The home was in disrepair, they had to use a ladder as a makeshift set of front steps to their home, and finding snakes and rats in their living space was commonplace. With the help of USDA Rural Development's Farm Labor Housing Program, the Municipality of Lares was able to build an affordable 24-home rental community, Alturas de Casta?er, dedicated solely to farm workers and their families. After moving into this community, living conditions improved dramatically for many residents. Residents like Jomar, an agricultor who uses a wheelchair for mobility; the closets and kitchen in his Alturas de Casta?er home were built for wheelchair accessibility. The community is quiet and clean, the children of the farm workers have a safe place to play, and the homes are well maintained by an experienced management company. It's affordable, too; farm workers living in this community are only to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent. Built in , Alturas de Casta?er was a product of a partnership between USDA Rural Development, Rural Opportunities Puerto Rico, Inc. (ROPRI), an affiliate of PathStone, the Puerto Rico Department of Housing, and the Federal Home Loan Bank. USDA and ROPRI have realized the success of the investment despite the significant challenges in planning and building a community in rural Puerto Rico. USDA and its partners are now looking forward to the development of self-sustaining community gardens which will also support a summer food program for children. An investment like Alturas de Casta?er, the only one of its kind in Puerto Rico, helps us realize that a better future is possible for rural Puerto Ricans.?

En el municipio de Lares, Puerto Rico, se encuentra Alturas de Casta?er, una comunidad en las monta?as donde viven 24 agricultores y sus familias. Los agricultores trabajan arduamente durante todo el a?o para producir caf¨¦, pl¨¢tanos, viandas y frutas c¨ªtricas que luego se venden en los mercados locales y a los restaurantes en la zona. Antes de llegar a la comunidad de Alturas de Casta?er, muchas familias viv¨ªan en espacios estrechos, a veces con dos o tres otras familias. Las condiciones eran insalubres y los ni?os estaban constantemente enfermos. Algunos hogares ni siquiera ten¨ªan techo y los residentes estaban peligrosamente expuestos a los elementos de la naturaleza, como las lluvias torrenciales durante la temporada de huracanes. Maria Rodriguez y su esposo, residentes de Alturas de Casta?er, recuerdan haber alquilado una casa que apenas pod¨ªan pagar. La casa estaba en mal estado, tuvieron que usar una escalera como escalones improvisados en la entrada de la casa y era com¨²n encontrar culebras y ratas dentro de la casa. Con la ayuda del Programa de Vivienda para Trabajadores Agr¨ªcolas de la Oficina de Desarrollo Rural de USDA, el municipio de Lares pudo construir Alturas de Casta?er, una comunidad de 24 viviendas de bajo costo para alquiler, destinada ¨²nicamente para los trabajadores agr¨ªcolas y sus familias. Luego de mudarse a esta comunidad, las condiciones de vida mejoraron dram¨¢ticamente para muchos residentes.

The Norfolk, Nebraska Area Habitat for Humanity (NAHFH) wanted to expand the impact of its home construction program, and get a more immediate return on investment so it could help the greatest number of people in need. USDA Rural Development was the agency NAHFH felt was best met that need. NAHFH utilized a community revitalization grant administered by the Northeast Nebraska Economic Development District (NENEDD), managed by Northeast Economic Development, Inc. (NED, Inc.) to demolish the dilapidated property that previously existed on the lot site.? The new construction was completed through donations of supplies and expertise, sweat equity and primarily through the building trades program at Northeast Community College. USDA Rural Development worked with Donald Parkos, the potential homebuyer, throughout the application process.? USDA Rural Development provided the first mortgage for him to purchase the home.? In addition to this, Parkos received down payment assistance.? Through the hard work of a number of partners, Donald was able to afford a newly built home for less than $100,000.? Today he resides in his 1,100 square foot, two bedroom, one bath home. The partnership had an impact far beyond that of just homeownership. The process helped revitalize a neighborhood by placing a nice, newly built home where a dilapidated structure once stood. It also helped create a sense of community and ownership in the neighborhood by all involved.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Food and Nutrition  May 16,  Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ¡°organic¡± really means can help consumers make informed choices. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ¡°Made with organic oats and cranberries.¡± A more generic statement like, ¡°Made with organic ingredients,¡± is not allowed. This is the sixteenth installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Deciphering food labels and marketing claims can be a challenge for the average consumer.? Companies use production and handling claims as a way to differentiate their products in the marketplace. Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ¡°organic¡± really means can help consumers make informed choices. USDA certified organic products have strict production and labeling requirements. ?The U.S. organic industry is regulated by the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service.? Certified organic products are produced without excluded methods such as genetic engineering or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). ?The organic standards are designed to allow natural substances in organic farming while prohibiting synthetic substances. There are four distinct labeling categories for certified organic food products ¨C 100% Organic, Organic, Made with organic ***, and specific organic ingredients.? There are also labeling requirements for organic livestock feed. Today, I wanted to talk more about the ¡°Made with organic***¡± category. Multi-ingredient agricultural products in the ¡°Made with organic ***¡± category must contain at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients (not including salt or water).? These products may contain up to 30 percent of allowed non-organic ingredients. ?All ingredients ¨C including the 30 percent non-organic ingredients ¨C must be produced without GMOs. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ¡°Made with organic oats and cranberries.¡±? A more generic statement like, ¡°Made with organic ingredients,¡± is not allowed. If an ingredient is identified in the ¡°Made with organic ***¡± statement, it must be a truthful claim. This means the product can only contain organic forms of that specific ingredient.?? For example, if the label states ¡°Made with organic corn¡± all raw and processed corn-based ingredients¡ªsuch as blue corn, corn oil, and corn starch¡ªmust be certified organic. The USDA organic regulations provide a set list of ¡°food groups.¡± All raw and processed forms of ingredients in that food group must be certified organic. For example, if a product states, ¡°Made with organic grains,¡± all ingredients derived from grains¡ªsuch as enriched wheat flour, corn oil, or oats¡ªmust be certified organic.? If a product contains both organic and non-organic forms of the same ingredient, they must be identified separately in the ingredient statement. ¡°Made with organic***¡± products can¡¯t use the USDA organic seal, but must identify the USDA-accredited certifying agent. You can look for the identity of the certifier on a packaged product for verification that the product meets USDA¡¯s organic standards.? Certifying agents are accredited by the USDA, and are responsible for ensuring that the USDA organic products meet or exceed all organic standards. The NOP recently put out final guidance on this labeling category to ensure consistency in labeling practices throughout the organic industry.? Consumers purchase organic products expecting that they maintain their organic integrity from farm to market, and USDA is committed to meeting these expectations.? Or, as we like to say at NOP, ¡°organic integrity from farm to table, consumers trust the organic label.¡±  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Tags:  AMS  Certification  farming  food labels  GMO  handling  National Organic Program  NOP  organic  Organic 101  organic certification  Organic Literacy Initiative  USDA Organic","What percentage of non-organic ingredients can an agricultural product contain while still being labeled as ""Made with organic***""?",Up to 30 percent.

Fortunately, Experimental Forests and Rangelands offer access to natural testing grounds for exploring puzzling forest and range management issues, such as how to contend with invasive species, wildfire and climate change. The educational materials from Experimental Forests and Rangelands provide a window into some of the research that these sites make possible. Spanning ates, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, they offer an unparalleled opportunity to view local, regional and national environmental change at the continental scale. Besides their comprehensive scope and stunning diversity, another distinguishing feature of Experimental Forests and Rangelands, is the long-term nature of their mission. Some collection efforts stretch back more than 100 years and others are projected to continue for another two centuries. The value of this information is immense, as there are very few comparable opportunities to capture long-term changes on forests and rangelands. Until a few decades ago, scientists and managers could not have predicted they would need to understand the effects of a changing climate on our natural resources. Fortunately, we have the long-term records from Experimental Forests and Rangelands.

"Economist at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 13,  Families Projected to Spend an Average of $233,610 Raising a Child Born in . USDA recently issued Expenditures on Children by Families, . This report is also known as ¡°The Cost of Raising a Child.¡± USDA has been tracking the cost of raising a child since and this analysis examines expenses by age of child, household income, budgetary component, and region of the country. Based on the most recent from the Consumer Expenditures Survey, in , a family will spend approximately $12,980 annually per child in a middle-income ($59,200-$107,400), two-child, married-couple family. Middle-income, married-couple parents of a child born in may expect to spend $233,610 ($284,570 if projected inflation costs are factored in*) for food, shelter, and other necessities to raise a child through age 17. This does not include the cost of a college education. Where does the money go? For a middle-income family, housing accounts for the largest share at 29% of total child-rearing costs.? Food is second at 18%, and child care/education (for those with the expense) is third at 16%. Expenses vary depending on the age of the child. As families often need more room to accommodate children, housing is the largest expense. We did the analysis by household income level, age of the child, and region of residence. Not surprising, the higher a family¡¯s income the more was spent on a child, particularly for child care/education and miscellaneous expenses. Expenses also increase as a child ages.? Overall annual expenses averaged about $300 less for children from birth to 2 years old, and averaged $900 more for teenagers between 15-17 years of age. Teenagers have higher food costs as well as higher transportation costs as these are the years they start to drive so insurance is included or a maybe a second car is purchased for them. Regional variation was also observed. Families in the urban Northeast spent the most on a child, followed by families in the urban West, urban South, and urban Midwest.? Families in rural areas throughout the country spent the least on a child¡ªchild-rearing expenses were 27% lower in rural areas than the urban Northeast, primarily due to lower housing and child care/education expenses. Child-rearing expenses are subject to economies of scale. That is, with each additional child, expenses on each declines. For married-couple families with one child, expenses averaged 27% more per child than expenses in a two-child family.? For families with three or more children, per child expenses averaged 24% less on each child than on a child in a two-child family.? This is sometimes referred to as the ¡°cheaper by the dozen¡± effect. Each additional child costs less because children can share a bedroom; a family can buy food in larger, more economical quantities; clothing and toys can be handed down; and older children can often babysit younger ones. Food costs have decreased over the years thanks to increased efficiency in American agriculture. This report is one of many ways that USDA works to support American families through our programs and work. It outlines typical spending by families from across the country, and is used in a number of ways to help support and education American families.? Courts and state governments use this to inform their decisions about child support and foster care payments.? Financial planners use the information to provide advice to their clients, and families can access our Cost of Raising a Child calculator, which we update with every report on our website, to look at spending patterns for families similar to theirs. This Calculator is one of many tools available on MyMoney.gov, a government research and clearinghouse related to financial education.

"Director, National Grain Center, GIPSA in  Research and Science  Oct 29,  Sec. Tom Vilsack visited the grain grading laboratory of GIPSA's Board of Appeals and Review (BAR) and the Grading Service Laboratory (GSL) on October 23, . BAR staff explain their grading review process while BAR Chairman Jim Whalen looks on. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration¡¯s (GIPSA) National Grain Center (NGC) was proud to host Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Wednesday, October 23.? The NGC, located in Kansas City, MO, is home to the Federal Grain Inspection Service¡¯s (FGIS) Technology and Science Division along with staff from FGIS¡¯ Quality Assurance and Compliance Division and Field Management Division. The grain inspectors, scientists and engineers at the NGC provide a broad spectrum of grain inspection services and support within recently renovated state of the art laboratories.?? During the visit, NGC staff demonstrated how they oversee, develop and approve methods and instruments used for grain inspection that ensure the consistent standard of measuring quality essential to grain marketing. Members of the Board of Appeals and Review (BAR) and the Grading Services Laboratory (GSL) described their critical role within the grain inspection process.? When a grain quality factor is measured through sensory evaluation ¨C how the grain looks or smells ¨C all grain inspectors looking at and smelling the grain sample must be looking for exactly the same thing. Tom Weber, Leader of GIPSA's Trace Analysis Laboratory, explains the process of preparing and testing grain samples for the presence of pesticide residues as Dr. Tim Norden, Chief of GIPSA's Analytical Chemistry Branch, and Mary Alonzo, Director of GIPSA's Technology and Science Division, watch. The BAR¡¯s experienced eyes and noses establish the point where a quality factor impacts a grain sample¡¯s overall grade.? The GSL monitors the accuracy of individual grain inspection results while the BAR monitors the overall grain inspection results against the BAR¡¯s standard of performance.? Both resolve appeals of grain inspection results determined at the initial point of inspection.? The BAR¡¯s interpretation is USDA¡¯s final and binding determination. Equating the process to finding a needle in a haystack, Dr. Tim Norden described how specialized instruments allow his team to analyze grain samples for trace amounts of pesticides and mycotoxins. The results are often used to confirm that U.S. grain meets international limits for these harmful chemicals.? Dr. Norden also emphasized that evolving technology requires that his staff and laboratory constantly maintain their skills. The NGC¡¯s Biotechnology Laboratory develops and validates methods to identify genetic events in grain.? Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief, Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discussed the multi-step process used by her team.? Dr. Bell also emphasized the collaborative nature of biotechnology methods development.? GIPSA¡¯s Biotechnology Proficiency Program, now in its tenth year, collaborates with over 200 laboratories around the world to ensure their ability to accurately detect genetic events.? GIPSA also works closely with other USDA agencies with biotechnology programs. Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief of GIPSA's Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discusses with Secretary Vilsack GIPSA's role in supporting agricultural biotechnology.  Test weight and moisture are the most commonly measured quality factors in all types of grain.???FGIS has developed a prototype for a training tool to improve inspector skills. Secretary Vilsack was able to see that technique does indeed make a difference while trying out a test weight trainer being developed by FGIS.? The test weight trainer measures a grain inspector¡¯s strike off technique against the approved standard.? New and experienced grain inspectors can use it to perfect their technique on this critical measurement. FGIS approved two instruments to measure moisture in all officially graded commodities over the past year.? The Unified Grain Moisture Algorithm (UGMA)-Compatible moisture meters offer improved performance under a wider range of conditions.? Dr. Dave Funk, GIPSA¡¯s Chief Scientist, developed the UGMA algorithm that is the basis of the measurement process of the new meters.? Dr. Funk recounted the development process, and demonstrated how the two machines offer equivalent results. The renovated NGC enhances GIPSA¡¯s ability to certify the accuracy and stability of instruments that measure various quality factors in grain. We all thank Secretary Vilsack for allowing us to show him how the NGC and FGIS support U.S. agriculture. TSD engineer Jason Jordon demonstrated to Secretary Vilsack the proper method for leveling off grain in the kettle used to measure test weight.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  May 14,  Organic certification cost share programs puts organic certification within reach for farms of all sizes. It is of great value to organic farmers and supports the integrity of the organic label. Consumers are increasingly looking for organic products when they visit the supermarket.? Last year, organic products reached a record number of sales, accounting for over $39 billion in U.S. retail sales.? To meet consumer demand, the industry needs more organic operations to produce everything from organic milk to organic granola bars.? Thanks to support from the Farm Bill, USDA has two cost share programs that assist organic farms and businesses with about $11 million per year in certification assistance¨C making it possible for producers and handlers of all sizes to consider organic certification.? Cost share programs support certified operations across the organic supply chain by making certification more affordable. The USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers these programs through grants to participating states. In , USDA funding allowed states to issue nearly 10,000 reimbursements worth more than $6 million, helping the organic community thrive and grow.? ""The U.S. is currently experiencing an explosion of demand for certified organic products and our goal is to see that demand is met by U.S. farmers,¡± said Abby Youngblood, Executive Director of the National Organic Coalition.? ¡°We expect that the organic cost share programs will encourage more U.S. farms to certify and/or add another certification scope to meet this demand."" Cost share programs cover a wide range of certification-related expenses, and cover 75 percent of the cost of each certification, up to a maximum of $750 annually. Here¡¯s how it works: If you¡¯re not yet certified, contact a certifier and get certified. If you are already a certified operation, contact your state agency; Submit your information ¨C a short application and tax form, proof of certification, and itemized expenses; and Get reimbursed by your state agency. ¡°As a small seed company, the cost share program helped make becoming certified organic a reality for us,¡±?said Ken Greene, Founder of the Hudson Valley Seed Library. ¡°We are proud of our certification, what it means about our seeds, and are committed to increasing the diversity and availability of certified organic seed for organic growers.¡± Organic certification lets consumers know that the products they buy meet the USDA organic requirements.?

"Kentucky State Director in  Rural  Jun 09,  Tex Peyton's new home is shown under construction next to the old one. USDA celebrates National Homeownership Month each year in June, and we continue to shine the spotlight on projects across the nation. I wanted to illustrate the work we do to provide ladders of opportunity for rural residents who might not have such an opportunity without the support of USDA Rural Development. I had the pleasure of meeting one such person this week. His name is Tex Peyton and for the past 18 years he lived in a basic two-room house in Eastern Kentucky that lacked indoor plumbing. Thanks to a team of partners that includes USDA Rural Development, Habitat for Humanity, Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and Columbia Pipeline, Peyton now has an affordable energy-efficient house that he is proud to call home ¨C in the community where he grew up in West Liberty. Habitat for Humanity provided the labor to build the home while USDA, along with our partners at Columbia Pipeline and Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, provided the financing for Peyton to purchase it. The house is incredibly energy-efficient and features a Lennox mini-split HVAC system, low e-argon windows and above-standard insulation in the walls, ceiling and floors ¨C building components that will significantly reduce the monthly cost of heating and cooling the home. Persistent poverty counties in Kentucky, like Morgan County where Peyton lives, face challenges that are unique to rural communities. They are often geographically isolated, lack educational opportunities, have high rates of unemployment and are usually underserved ¨C qualities that impede economic opportunity and reduce quality of life. USDA places special emphasis on persistent poverty counties and utilizes a strategy of partnering public resources with local expertise to grow rural economies and create jobs in these poverty-stricken areas. It is because of this emphasis, and the hard work of all our partners, that we had the ability to help Tex Peyton ¨C and the privilege of celebrating with him as he opened his home to us this week. USDA has a proud tradition of assisting rural residents like Tex achieve the dream of homeownership that encompasses more than 60 years. We look forward to continuing that tradition.

"AMS National Organic Program Deputy Director in  Conservation  Jul 30,  To protect the integrity of the organic industry and its products, farms must certify that their operations are following USDA organic regulations. The USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service offers farms resources to help offset the certification costs. This is the seventh installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Annual organic certification fees allow certifiers to carry out their responsibilities. These fees vary according to an operation¡¯s size and other variables. In light of that, the USDA organic cost share programs help to ensure that these costs don¡¯t discourage those wanting to pursue organic certification. The programs make certification more affordable by reimbursing producers and handlers for as much as 75%¡ªup to a maximum of $750 a year¡ªfor their certification costs. Eligible costs include application fees, inspection fees, travel for certification inspectors, and even postage. ¡°After I figured out how to apply, I found it to be easy,¡± said Gary Philbrick of Philbrick Farms, a Paso Robles, Calif., organization that is certified to produce walnuts. ¡°I just save my receipts and fill out the necessary form and send it in [to the state].¡± State governments administer the organic cost-share funds, appropriated by Congress under the Farm Bill. State governments, usually Departments of Agriculture, work with USDA to administer the program and distribute funds to growers, ranchers, and handlers that are currently certified to the USDA organic regulations. Applicants submit a short form along with proof of certification and an itemized invoice to their state agencies. The state verifies these applications before disbursing funds to eligible organic operations. The program is not competitive, so anyone who is eligible may apply for a reimbursement. ¡°I¡¯m a small farmer, and this program helps me a lot,¡± said Nancy Abramson of Rooster Ridge Farm, a 20-acre operation that devotes one-fifth of its acreage to growing everything from organic citrus to flowers to herbs. ¡°In the beginning, I had a huge fee [getting certified], but the cost share gave me two-thirds of it back. The paperwork is nothing. I think the program is fantastic, and it makes organic farming very affordable for small farmers.¡± Philbrick Farms, based in Paso Robles, Calif., harvests its certified organic walnuts in the fall. With the help of a shaker truck, walnuts fall to the ground and are collected to be sent to the processor for further handling. In particular, smaller operations like Philbrick Farms benefit from USDA¡¯s organic cost share programs, which reimburse producers for as much as 75% of their certification fees. Photo courtesy of Philbrick Farms. When it comes to organic certification, there are many things small growers or handlers have to consider. Affordability is important and often at the top of the list. Organic certification not only fulfills a desired method of farming, but also meets the increased consumer demand for foods farmed and handled organically. ¡°It¡¯s a huge benefit for me that I can advertise that I¡¯m certified organic,¡± said Abramson. ¡°There¡¯s such a marketing plus, and it gets [my product] into grocery stores that require me to be organic.¡± In addition to stocking grocery stores, Abramson takes pride in being able to market her products as organic when selling to consumers at the local farmers market and to the restaurants near her Santa Cruz operation. They all appreciate her organic spinach. The organic cost share program is one of many programs that USDA offers to support emerging, transitioning, or current organic growers and handlers.

"NRCS Oregon in  Conservation  Jan 18,  Sarahlee Lawrence inspects a row of organically grown flowers on her organic farm in the high desert of Central Oregon. Business is blooming for Sarahlee Lawrence and her organic food-and-flower-growing operation, Rainshadow Organics, in the Central Oregon high desert. The 28-year old organic pioneer is proud of her venture and credits USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a key component to her success. Lawrence approached NRCS several years ago to start the process of making her farm organic. NRCS helped her plan and implement a nutrient management program and address irrigation issues on both a two-acre vegetable-and-flower plot and a 25-acre field where she grows a mix of cover crops like wheat and clover. NRCS provided assistance to Lawrence through two Farm Bill programs. The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) Organic Initiative is a nationwide special effort to provide financial assistance to National Organic Program (NOP) certified organic producers, as well as producers in the process of transitioning to organic production. And the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) is a cooperative program to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Drip irrigation system made possible by the NRCS Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP). Lawrence is especially pleased with the newly installed drip irrigation system that supplies water to more than 100 varieties of produce and a colorful assortment of flowers on her two-acre parcel. ¡°I could not have afforded or done that by myself,¡± she explains. To be certified organic, a U.S. agricultural operation has to be approved by a USDA Accredited Certifying Agent. Applicants must comply with USDA Organic regulations and submit documentation on their property and farming practices. Transitioning to organic is often a lengthy process, as Lawrence knows. Fields may require preparation to support organic production, including the planting of cover crops, incorporating compost and other soil-enhancing practices. While it takes a while to transition an operation to a Certified Organic one, Lawrence is pleased with her progress. The market for fresh, locally grown food continues to expand in Central Oregon, and her customers include a local hospital, schools and restaurants. Over 100 different types produce are grown on this two-acre organic operation, ranging from beets and beans to cabbage and strawberries. She has also generated a new, dedicated client base through community supported agriculture (CSA). CSA is a way for consumers to directly invest in local farms and receive a regular delivery of fresh fruits, vegetables and other local products. Lawrence looks forward to a bright, rewarding and sustainable future. Find out more about the EQIP Organic Initiative. Check out more conservation stories on the USDA blog. Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"Writer, Analytics Center of Excellence, Office of the Chief Information Officer in  Technology  Jun 17,  Hackathon participants use sensors and robotics to create solutions with USDA . Photo credit: BeMyApp The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently took another step forward on its path to accelerate information technology (IT) modernization and improve how it designs agricultural services and interacts with agricultural producers. This spring, USDA joined technical experts, IT professionals, and application developers for the first hackathon at the Internet of Things (IoT) World Conference in Santa Clara, California. Working collaboratively, the hackathon teams developed new solutions to challenging issues affecting agriculture. What are Hackathons? Hackathons are typically multi-day events where programmers and designers engage in collaborative computer programming. ¡°The goal is not gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, or to necessarily produce a completely polished product,¡± said Andrew Brown, Soil Scientist at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and mentor at the hackathon. ¡°Rather, hackathons focus on innovation, collaboration, and rapid application development.¡± The hackathon was a fitting channel to address key challenges the USDA is working to solve. ¡°Hackathons are a great way to spur innovation and have the potential to solve real issues,¡± said Ted Kaouk, Chief Officer (CDO) for USDA¡¯s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). ¡°Farmers and ranchers are using from satellites, weather forecasts, sensors, and other technology for more precise agriculture, which is helping to improve agricultural processes on their operation while increasing profits and providing even better protection to the environment.¡± USDA employees supported the hackathon by serving as judges and mentors for the competition. Inside the Hackathon Hackathon participants were challenged to use USDA¡¯s soil, geospatial, and water forecasting to develop IT products that addressed access to water resources and wise water use to support the sustainability, growth, and viability of agriculture. They were to consider the following in their solutions: limited use of broadband in the rural U.S., cybersecurity, and applying machine learning models to make -driven decisions. The hackathon event was preceded by a discovery interlude where participants explored water challenges in agriculture and brainstormed ideas on possible solutions given their shared knowledge of the domain, technology, , and other areas. A webinar one week prior to the event provided an overview of the hackathon and discussion of the datasets, and messaging application, Slack, was used where USDA mentors could answer questions regarding USDA , tools, and resources. The hackathon was a two-day event that included participation from eight teams ranging from two to seven people. During the event, each team gathered around a table to devise a solution while mentors walked around the room to check in, ask questions, and provide guidance. ¡°Mentors worked one-on-one with hackathon participants to help them conceptualize the challenge and apply the datasets,¡± said Brown. ¡°Most participants had an approach in mind and a general goal and needed help with conceptual aspects of interpreting the . Agricultural production systems have fundamental limits and unique considerations that make subject matter expert input very valuable. The mentor cadre¡¯s practical experience in agriculture and environmental problems was critical to helping teams keep their solutions in the realm of possibility.¡± By 1:00 p.m. on the second day, all code needed to be completed. In the afternoon, each team had three minutes to ¡°pitch¡± their solution. Of the eight groups that were formed, three finalists were selected to present their solutions on stage at the ¡°EcoCenter System Stage¡± located on the Expo Center floor. After the judges reviewed the presentations, Carlos Suarez, NRCS State Conservationist for California, announced ¡°Team Smart Ag¡± as the winner and presented them with the hackathon trophy. Team Smart Ag¡¯s Winning Solution Team Smart Ag developed a low-cost, low-power smart-farming solution that would enable farmers to use devices to monitor a variety of conditions, such as water needs for crops and livestock health. The open-source, conversational artificial intelligence (AI) platform includes a phone application that allows farmers to ask questions, such as ¡°Where do I need to water today?¡±. Team Smart Ag also created a 3D visualization of a hypothetical farm to provide a first-person view of the land, so farmers can locate runoff and areas that need water. In addition to winning the hackathon trophy, Team Smart Ag received prizes valued at $15K total, which included an interview with ITPro Today and opportunities to present their winning solution at highly-visible events at the conference. Hackathons as Part of IT Modernization Model The hackathon follows the White House¡¯s push toward IT modernization through the new Center of Excellence (CoE) model. The model has five focus areas: cloud adoption, IT infrastructure optimization, customer experience, service delivery analytics, and contact centers. USDA, which has been designated a CoE, is using this new model to support the improved use of IT resources throughout the department. The CoE is planning to support additional competitions this year.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jul 13,  The Stoltzfuses use high tunnels to lengthen the growing season for fresh fruits and vegetables. They built the first high tunnel on their own, and they liked it so much, they decided to build a second one with the help of NRCS.  For many farmers, the lessons of agriculture begin at a young age. This is true for Florence, Miss., farmer Kathy Stoltzfus, who says that her dad taught her what she knows when she was a child. She has fond memories of running barefoot through rice fields and the taste of freshly grown food. Now Stoltzfus and her husband, Bob, run a small farm in central Mississippi, where they raise fruits, vegetables and eggs. Her farming experience, coupled with his grocer experience, makes them a powerhouse at the Mississippi Farmers Market in Jackson, where they sell many different vegetables, including a variety of greens, broccoli, onions, radishes, peas, tomatoes, squash and zucchini. Their eggs are a hit, selling out every Saturday at the market. The Stoltzfuses started selling at the farmer¡¯s market as part-time farmers in , but two years later, the couple decided that they would leave their day jobs to farm full-time. While operating a small farm is hard work, they are happy with their successes and grateful for help from USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency that helps private landowners implement conservation to protect the environment and improve productivity. They learned about NRCS from a fellow producer at the market who told them about the technical assistance and cost-share assistance offered by the agency. Through NRCS¡¯ Environmental Quality Incentives Program, their farm is on pace to be certified as organic as early as the end of this year. NRCS also worked with the couple to build a seasonal high tunnel to keep their fruits and vegetables safe from the cold weather and construct a wildlife fence to protect their crops from hungry deer and rabbits. Bob and Kathy Stoltzfus (center) are working with NRCS conservationists Malcolm Lowe (left) and Mark Scott (right) to make their Florence, Miss. farm more productive. High tunnels have a metal frame wrapped in plastic and are easy and fairly cheap to build. They are designed to extend the growing season into the cold months, helping to increase productivity, keep plants at a steady temperature and even conserve water and energy. NRCS funds high tunnels as part of USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, launched in to help local food systems thrive. The Stoltzfuses plan to continue enlarging their operation. With 32 acres at their disposal, they hope to start a small beef cattle operation. Both say that they¡¯re doing what they¡¯re meant to do. Bob enjoys the quiet of the countryside, and Kathy is happy to have returned to her heritage. Learn more about the Environmental Quality Incentives Program Follow NRCS on Twitter.

USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. This challenge served as an important backdrop for USDA to hear feedback from the community on how the agency could prioritize its resources and shape future workplans related to organic agriculture and markets. Anchoring the panel of listeners were Mark Lipson, organic policy advisor to the Secretary and key coordinator of the department¡¯s organic agenda, and myself, as well as a host of rotating officials who represented agencies like the Foreign Agriculture Service, which engages in trade negotiations to expand agricultural product exchange with other countries, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which administers the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). A full spectrum of topics was covered during the day. Some shared their concerns about effects of genetic engineering on their businesses (genetic modification is an excluded method in the organic standards). Some emphasized the need to continue international negotiations that would facilitate trade and expand markets for their organic products. Some recognized the value of small farmers in organic sector innovation. Others highlighted the vital role of NOP enforcement in ensuring organic integrity. And still others highlighted the importance of engaging a new generation of farmers and expressed their support of programs that help alleviate the cost of certification. The wide range of topics and the people who shared them speak to the unique market value of USDA organic and the desire of organic stakeholders to protect the integrity of the seal. A transcript of the listening session will be available on the AMS website soon. For those that were not able to attend in person, we are continuing to accept comments about the activities and priorities related to our continued support of organic agriculture production, handling, and markets.

"Risk Management Agency Administrator in  Rural  Jul 21,   USDA¡¯s Risk Management Agency (RMA) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) working together have made great strides in making acreage reporting simpler for farmers and ranchers. ?The Acreage and Crop Reporting Streamlining Initiative (ACRSI), seeks to reduce the reporting burden on producers submitting to USDA. In listening sessions with producers last year, FSA and the Office of the Chief Information Officer found some common themes emerged: 1) Producers want to provide their information such as acreage reporting , just once, and expect USDA agencies to share the internally -¡®one-stop¡¯ reporting; 2)? Producers currently provide the same information multiple times; and 3)? Acreage reporting is inefficient and is not always accurate ACRSI will standardize requirements and automate the reporting process.? It is a huge step toward one-stop reporting and permits easier identification of discrepancies and misreporting. Ultimately, ACRSI could allow for automated reporting from a producer¡¯s GPS monitoring equipment. Another big benefit:? Reduced USDA operating costs and improved integrity and accuracy Now we want more input. We believe the public, especially producers, ranchers, and the crop insurance industry may have suggestions to help further reduce the reporting burden.

"Legislative and Public Affairs, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in  Animals  Jun 01,  If you are moving this year from a location within the gypsy moth quarantine area to a location outside the quarantine area, please inspect outdoor household items for pests. This is a federal requirement for homeowners moving from gypsy moth quarantine areas. By complying with the law, you may also save a forest. Gypsy moths are destructive, invasive pests! European gypsy moth larvae feed on over 300 plant species including oak, aspen and elm. Gypsy moths have defoliated more than ates since . About 70% of susceptible forests have never been infested and are at risk. Male gypsy moths are brown and smaller than female gypsy moths, which are primarily white. Females lay fuzzy yellowish-brown egg masses from which caterpillars emerge bearing distinctive red and blue dots. Like many invasive insects, gypsy moths can spread long distances with human assistance. They are notorious hitchhikers and lay their eggs on patio furniture, grills, lawn mowers, children¡¯s toys, and other outdoor items. Larvae can hide on untreated firewood or other wooden items such as pallets and crates. The good news is you can help stop them. If you are moving, use the self-inspection checklist (, 3.6 ) and remove any insects or egg masses you find. To learn more about protecting your neighborhood and how you can help, visit USDA¡¯s Your Move Gypsy Moth Free website.

Collaborating with U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the ports, APHIS intercepted more than 109,000 plant pests at our borders. Allocating over $70 million to support plant protection projects nationwide under the Plant Protection Act¡¯s Section Program, APHIS continues to protect our crops and natural resources. In , APHIS swiftly responded to a detection of Ralstonia solanacearum. Employees tested over 4,000 plant samples across 12 states and 16 facilities within 21 days. In June, APHIS released the Spotted Lanternfly 5-Year Strategy, a unified approach to combat the invasive insect. This year, APHIS also evaluated the Agriculture Quarantine and Inspection user fees to address inflation, capital improvements, and staffing needs, to ensure the program¡¯s continued ability to protect U.S. agriculture, trade, and commerce. Throughout the year, APHIS scientists conducted around 200 pest risk analyses, enhancing the agency's ability to make informed policy decisions and protect against invasive pathogens. Internationally, a significant achievement was negotiating with Bangladesh to eliminate a fumigation requirement for U.S.-sourced cotton, potentially expanding the $475 million cotton export market. These accomplishments underscore APHIS' dedication to its mission. For a deeper dive, explore our most successful plant programs and activities in Plant Protection Today.

"Coordinator, USDA Caribbean Climate Hub in  Climate  Nov 09,  Four years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the Caribbean, there is still an urgency to understand how to best prepare farmers and working lands for future hurricanes. Agricultural advisors are first responders and witnesses of hurricane impacts and strategies used in hurricane preparedness and recovery. A new study by the USDA Caribbean Climate Hub analyzes the experiences of agricultural advisors involved in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to identify gaps in hurricane preparedness and recovery measures. ¡±Climate projections indicate the Caribbean will experience more intense hurricanes, which will increase the challenges to agriculture and food security. There is an urgent need to improve hurricane preparedness to minimize hurricane effects on the agricultural sector in the Caribbean,¡± said Dr. Nora ¨¢lvarez-Berr¨ªos, the study¡¯s lead author. The research team surveyed over 200 advisors from eight institutions who reported on the difficulties farmers face in the recovery process, including lack of supplies such as seeds, fertilizers and animal feed, lack of equipment and machinery for clean-up, impaired access to farms, and the need to expedite government assistance to meet farmers¡¯ needs. Importantly, advisors indicated that while farmers and ranchers do apply recovery practices, the application of short-term preparedness practices is limited, and long-term preparedness practices are generally uncommon. The advisors also reported on the challenges they face in assisting farmers, such as the inability to access farms, transportation issues, and lengthy times to reach farmers. They highlighted the need for more training and educational resources to improve hurricane recovery response, and more tools to help farmers cope with emotional distress post-disaster. The Caribbean Hub disseminates information on hurricane preparedness and best management practices to help reduce risks and mitigate hurricane effects.

"Pollinators like honeybees, butterflies, birds, bats and other animals are hard at work providing vital but often unnoticed services. They pollinate crops like apples, bananas, blueberries, strawberries, melon, peaches, potatoes, vanilla, almonds, coffee and chocolate. Pollinators by Numbers Three-fourths of the world¡¯s flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world¡¯s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. That¡¯s one out of every three bites of food you eat. More than 3,500 species of native bees help increase crop yields. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators like bees, butterflies and moths, birds and bats, and beetles and other insects. The Pollinator Partnership The Pollinator Partnership offers 32 different planting guides to improve pollinator habitat, each one tailored to a specific ecoregion in the United States. Each guide is filled with an abundance of native plant and pollinator information. Enter your zip code to find your planting guide. How Animal Pollination Works Pollinators visit flowers in their search for food (nectar and pollen). During a flower visit, a pollinator may accidentally brush against the flower¡¯s reproductive parts, unknowingly depositing pollen from flower to flower. The plant uses the pollen to produce a fruit or seed. Many plants cannot reproduce without pollen carried to them by foraging pollinators. Pollinators Are in Trouble You may have heard that bees are disappearing and bats are dying. These and other animal pollinators face many challenges in the modern world. Habitat loss, disease, parasites, and environmental contaminants have all contributed to the decline of many species of pollinators. Pollinators that can¡¯t find the right quantity or quality of food (nectar and pollen from blooming plants within flight range) don¡¯t survive. Right now, there simply aren¡¯t enough pollinator friendly plantings to support pollinators. Learn more about how USDA is helping pollinators. Learn more about these pollinators: Bats Butterflies Helpful Hint: Did you know dandelions are the first food for bees emerging in the spring. Leave them in your yard and feed the bees! Dandelion petals and leaves are also edible and can be used in salads. You Can Help Pollinators You can help pollinators in your garden at home. Pollinators make use of food and habitat anywhere it is found, whether on roadsides, in a schoolyard garden or a planter on a windowsill. Here¡¯s how:  Complete a Wildlife Assessment. One of the first steps in creating new habitat for pollinators is to first assess and evaluate your existing space. Habitat assessments can be great tools to identify practices where you can improve or confirm good practices you already have in place. The Xerces Society has several different habitat assessment guides for different types of landscapes or specific insects. The Habitat Assessment Guide for Pollinators in Yards, Gardens, and Parks is a great resource for small and urban sites, including urban farms. The Pollinators: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and Beneficial Insects: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and two other great options for assessing agricultural lands. For more information on providing ground, stem, and cavity nesting sites and overwintering sites, be sure to check out Xerces guide on Nesting & Overwintering Habitat for Pollinators & Other Beneficial Insects.  Types of Habitat. There are several habitat opportunities and strategies you can use to invite pollinators into your urban farms, gardens, or yards. Pollinator habitat can beautify your space, increase native biodiversity, increase pollination services and biological control of ¡°pest¡± insects, and provide community engagement and learning opportunities. Often for smaller scale gardens in urban areas, plugs or transplanted plants from pots are preferred over pure live wildflower seeds.  Plant Native Plants. Native plants are considered the best choice because of their abundance of nectar and pollen in addition to being low maintenance, generally pest free, drought tolerant, and ability to control erosion. They are good sources of food and shelter for wildlife, and naturally beautiful.  Plant a continuous food supply. Make sure you have at least 3 different species throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons to provide adequate food when pollinators emerge from and prepare for winter hibernation. Plant in groupings (clumps) of each plant species for a greater impact.  Include a diversity of plants. Different flower sizes, shapes and , as well as varying plant heights and growth habits, support a greater number and diversity of pollinators. Include a combination of native plant species, heirloom plants and herbs in your pollinator garden. Common herbs such as rosemary, oregano, basil, marjoram, and borage are excellent pollinator plants. Allow unharvested fruits and vegetables to bolt (go to flower) for added pollinator and beneficial insect food.  Limit or eliminate use of pesticides. A healthy garden with the appropriate plant species and an abundance of pollinators will support natural beneficial insects¡ªreducing the need for pest control.   Install bat boxes. Bats are also pollinators that need our help. Leave snags for habitat or install a bat box. Learn more about the benefits of bats!  Spread Awareness. Educate others about the importance of pollinators and share how you planted for bees, butterflies, birds and other animals at home.

"It's ideal to have host plants and nectar plants growing in your garden if your goal is to attract butterflies. Selecting what to plant varies enormously based on what butterfly species you wish to attract. Butterflies will roam in search of food and egg-laying sites for many miles¡ªeven hundreds to thousands¡ªof miles. Butterflies lay their eggs on host plants that the emerging caterpillars will eat. Different species of butterflies prefer different types of plants to lay their eggs on. Milkweed and Monarch Butterflies The monarch butterfly however is very specific and only lays her eggs on species of Asclepias - commonly known as milkweed. Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies migrate from the United States and Canada to overwintering areas in Mexico and California and make the return flight in spring. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat, are having a devastating impact on monarch populations.

"The People's Garden Apiary, installed in , is located on the roof of the Jamie L. Whitten Building and has homed up to approximately 80,000 Italian honey bees. USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Bee Research Lab in Beltsville, Maryland, helps keep these colonies of bees strong and healthy so they can pollinate crops growing in the People's Garden and neighboring landscapes. They also produce delicious honey! Beehives are often important elements of urban gardens due to the pollination services they provide. They¡¯re also big business. Honeybees pollinate $ates each year, including more than 130 types of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Honeybees also produce honey, worth about $3.2 million in according to USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). How are hives constructed? The beehives are wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other. Each box (or super) holds 8-10 wooden frames which include a thin sheet of wax foundation in each frame. The bees build their combs on these foundations. How is honey extracted? Honey is stored in the combs in the upper parts of the hive. When the bees have filled the combs in the upper section with honey and covered them with wax caps, the beekeeper takes them away to extract the honey. Are honey bees native to the United States? Honey bees are not native to the United States. The scientific name for honey bee is Apis mellifera. Since humans first began keeping honey bees, their principal aim has been the harvest of honey. Beekeepers select the appropriate type of honey bee based on temperament, physical characteristics, disease resistance, and productivity. Italian honey bees were selected for the People's Garden Apiary because they are most often used in commercial beekeeping in the United States. These bees have a relatively gentle disposition and are good honey producers. They are not the most resistant to disease, but they excel in most other areas. There have been some queen survivorship issues in both of the People's Garden colonies, which actually mirrors what's going on in the rest of the country. Queen health is an issue for everyone who buys queens, commercial or hobbyist. The exact underlying reasons for poor queen survivorship is unknown, but the ARS lab is actively researching this problem.",What are some common issues affecting queen honey bee survival in commercial and hobbyist beekeeping operations?,"Some common issues affecting queen honey bee survival include queen health problems, disease resistance, poor temperament, physical characteristics, and productivity.

"Bats occupy almost every habitat in the world. There are over 1,300 species of bats worldwide. Bats are one of the most misunderstood animals. People imagine them to be blood-sucking, rabies-ridden, hair-tangling, night-stalking, loathsome creatures. The truth is, very few bats (less than 1 percent) carry rabies. Even fewer bats are bold enough to come near people, and most feed on pollen or insects. Many are listed as endangered. Bats reportedly eat as many as 600 insects in an hour. By leaving snags and habitat or putting up a bat house, you provide a safe place for bats to live and you may notice fewer mosquitoes and insects around your home or in your garden. Bats devour tons of insects nightly, pollinate flowers, and spread seeds that grow new plants and trees. They are our most important natural predators of night-flying insects, consuming mosquitoes, moths, beetles, crickets, leafhoppers and chinch bugs, among others. Many of these insects are serious crop or forest pests, while others spread disease to humans or livestock. Every year, bats save us billions of dollars in pest control by simply eating insects. Bat houses are easy to build. The narrow slats in the bat house give bats a safe dark place to crawl in and sleep during the day. It often takes 2 years for bats to occupy a new bat house because bats don¡¯t relocate often. Bats are loyal to a roost site, so unless it¡¯s destroyed or overcrowded bats won¡¯t move to another location. Even if only about 15 percent of bat houses are occupied at any time, by building one and putting it up in the right place, you're doing your part to help and encourage bats in rural, suburban, and urban areas.

"Vermont/New Hampshire USDA Rural Development state director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 12,  USDA Rural Development¡¯s Business and Loan Guarantee Program supported new construction for an expanded Brattleboro Food Coop in Brattleboro, Vermont. The original plan for two stories was expanded to four thanks to an innovative partnership with the Windsor Housing Trust to develop mixed-income apartments. ¡°Smart Growth¡± is a term we hear more and more often.? It is the idea that as communities plan for the future, they consider the highest and best use of every resource ¨C land, infrastructure, organizations and people.? ? From housing to transportation to energy to food; community developers and planners are asking how Smart Growth principles can be applied to ensure a sustainable and dynamic future for their communities and their residents. How is USDA involved in these efforts? Consider Brattleboro, Vermont.? With a population of 12,000, Brattleboro sits on the state¡¯s southeastern border, and is a vibrant mix of industry, art and education.? ??Brattleboro¡¯s downtown district was one of the first communities to take advantage of Vermont¡¯s Downtown Program giving it access to state tax credits and shining a spotlight on its rich history. Its vibrant downtown is an inviting mix of shops, restaurants, offices and an art deco theatre and hotel.? ??Anchoring one end of the downtown is the Brattleboro Food Coop. Founded in , the Brattleboro Food Coop started as a local buying club.? It eventually grew into a popular retail destination featuring a wide range of products from nearby farms in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. ?By , the Brattleboro Coop was outgrowing its space.? It considered moving to a new location outside of downtown.? The Board of the Coop, however, decided that its mission was much more compatible with a Smart Growth solution to its expansion needs.? ? In the meantime, the Windham and Windsor Housing Trust (WWHT) and Housing Vermont, were looking for a solution to?Brattleboro¡¯s need for more mixed income housing that was easily accessible to downtown¡¯s services and amenities. With support from a loan guarantee from USDA¡¯s Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program, the Brattleboro Coop remained downtown in a new, highly energy efficient building with expanded retail space. ?The new Coop space was originally envisioned as a two story building.?? Through innovative partnerships, an additional two stories on the new building were sold to WWHT and Housing Vermont.? ?Though the Coop and the housing complex have separate ownership, they have similar commitment to the sustainable future of Brattleboro. The Brattleboro Coop is featured in the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass for its dedication to local food and local communities. It recently received a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its commitment to Smart Growth principles.  The results are stunning.?

"Chief, FSA Public Affairs in  Conservation  Aug 22,  New Jersey farmer Liang Shao Hua listens to NRCS technical advisor Frank Wu provide advice in Chinese Mandarin, Liang¡¯s native language. His limited English proficiency restricted his exposure to USDA farm programs until Tropical Storm Sandy made it necessary for Liang to connect with the department for assistance. He is now an FSA loan recipient and appreciates the cost-share benefits of the Emergency Conservation Program funds that assisted his family¡¯s clean-up efforts. Disasters create pain.? And recovery from disasters creates partnerships and opportunity. That is the lesson Liang Shao Hua learned in the past year after Tropical Storm Sandy, also known as Super Storm Sandy, destroyed his New Jersey high-tunnel farming operation and left him wondering how to manage his loss. Liang, a Chinese American with very limited English proficiency, relied first on his American-born son, Peter, a 21-year-old college student studying at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York. Peter obtained USDA paperwork from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) that helped his father apply for Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funds.? He, his brother, David, 19, and mother, Pei Yin, joined Liang in the clean-up efforts. Liang Shao Hua was among 315 successful applicants for ECP, one-third from New Jersey.? The applicants stretched from West Virginia to New Hampshire. That was the wide swath where Sandy and her trailing cold front left a path of destruction to Atlantic Coast and New England farms. Congress authorizes ECP funds to assist farmers and ranchers with removal of debris.? Funds can be used to do tasks like repair fences.? The objective is to return the land that has been damaged by a natural disaster to normal productive use. Liang began farming his New Jersey acreage in .? After immigrating to the United States in , Liang had tried his hand in the restaurant, clothing and local trucking industries. ?He said a friend told him to look into farming, so he did.? He bought land and began to grow vegetables. His 54-acre farm in Mercer County, 60 miles southwest of New York City, did well in the summer.? He grew traditional Asia vegetables ¨C bitter melon, Chinese long beans, greens and various choy sum, also known as Chinese flowering cabbage. Liang said through an interpreter that he enjoys farming because ¡°I¡¯m my own boss.¡± He chose to expand his growing season in . He erected 20 high tunnels to heat, water and protect his seedlings so he could produce well into cooler outdoor temperatures.? The high tunnels went up two months before Sandy hit. Once the storm struck, Liang needed help. ?FSA came to his aid. ?So did others with more than financial assistance. ?Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) New Jersey Partner Employee Frank Wu appeared with multiple skills. One of which was the ability to speak Mandarin Chinese.? He also provided technical counsel. Among the FSA staff called on to take a lead role was Matthew Pavone, a Farm Loan Specialist.? Pavone began processing an emergency loan, a low-interest rate credit tool made available when the Secretary of Agriculture declares a county a natural disaster area.? Coincidentally, Pavone is married to an Asian American, although he says she was adopted by an Italian American family, so ¡°she¡¯s more Italian than I am.¡±? Still, her birth heritage drew both of them to study and appreciate the Asian culture.? Pavone and Liang related well. The other FSA knights in shining armor were Monmouth County Executive Director Gabor (Gabi) Grunstein and Program Technician Beth Pine.? Grunstein and Pine set up the cost-share ECP to help the Liang family clean up Sandy¡¯s mess. The storm ripped apart the new high tunnels, folded aluminum piping, snapped wood braces and irrigation water lines, and threw nearby trees into the structures.? Clean-up was laborious, but it got done. With FSA¡¯s loan funds in hand, Liang quickly rebuilt his high-tunnel operation for this season¡¯s production.? His voice radiates excitement when speaking.? He is clearly much happier in than he was a year earlier.? He knows who to thank: Pavone, Grunstein, Pine and Wu, among others as USDA. New Jersey FSA State Executive Director Paul Hlubik said the experience was a significant breakthrough for the department as well.? Liang was a typical small-farm producer handicapped by his language barrier.? That put Liang in a category that the department recognizes as an important contributor to the overall farm economy, but one needing special assistance. ?Liang¡¯s limited ability to know about the services available from his adoptive national government calls for extraordinary outreach to assist him and farmers like Liang. Hlubik asserts that Liang¡¯s son, Peter, was clearly one who helped his father become aware of opportunities because of the young man¡¯s schooling.? Now that his father understands one of USDA¡¯s roles in assisting agricultural producers, he may become a valued customer for life. Liang says he¡¯s eager to expand his operation, buy more land and grow more vegetables.? He said the Asian market is growing.? Hlubik and Pavone say the grocery stores and chains like H-Mart appreciate operations like Liang¡¯s.? The New Jersey farmland is perfectly located to easily serve markets and restaurants from New York City to Philadelphia. No natural disaster is welcomed, but it did open up new opportunities for Liang Shao Hua.? He discovered new partners and new ways of doing business through USDA.? Meanwhile, USDA discovered a new customer who produces a highly valued crop. Does he fear future storms?? Liang says, ¡°weather doesn¡¯t matter; it¡¯s going to happen.?

My curiosity about the natural world never slows down, and I am not intimidated by difficult problems.? But the research I¡¯ve been doing since has been the most challenging:? how do we transform what we know about weather, weather variability, climate, and climate change into practical advice for farmers and ranchers?? This is not just one problem in my mind, but three.? Three huge gnarly problems, each close to intractable.? But these new USDA Climate Hubs are an opportunity to make progress on all three.? What follows are thumbnails of the three problems I have in mind, and then briefly how I see the Climate Hubs providing a handle on them.  Jeanne Schneider of USDA's Grazinglands Research Laboratory, El Reno, Okla.  Posted in  Conservation  Feb 11,   3 Responses","What are the three huge problems that farmers and ranchers face due to weather variability, climate, and climate change, as perceived by a research scientist working on transforming climate knowledge into practical advice?",1. Transforming weather and climate knowledge into practical advice for farmers and ranchers. 2. Managing weather variability and its impact on agricultural production. 3. Adapting to climate change and its effects on agriculture.

"Secretary's Column: The White House Rural Council: Partnering in Support of Rural America  Rural America faces tremendous uncertainty today. Congress has not yet passed a Food, Farm and Jobs Bill, and the current extension of Farm Bill programs will soon expire. Additionally, thus far, no budget has been provided by Congress to continue funding the Federal government past September 30. Amid this uncertainty, USDA remains focused on our mission and on our work to revitalize the rural economy.? We have delivered record investments under President Obama¡¯s leadership, and we will continue working to do so. ??In a time of reduced resources, we¡¯ve also taken a wide range of new, collaborative approaches with other government agencies¡ªcomplementing our public-private partnerships and creating better collaboration among state and local partners.  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack  Posted in  Conservation  USDA Results  Sep 20,   1 Response",Will the expiration of Farm Bill programs cause a significant impact on rural America's agricultural sector?,"Yes,  the expiration of Farm Bill programs will soon expire and Congress has not yet passed a new Food, Farm and Jobs Bill, which may cause uncertainty and potentially have a significant impact on rural America's agricultural sector."
"USDA Kansas Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  May 22,   The City of Quinter, Kansas, had a groundbreaking ceremony for a new fire station earlier this month. ?All of the city¡¯s fire equipment will soon be under one roof, which will help improve the fire station¡¯s efficiencies when crews respond to emergencies in its 400 square mile service area.? The new station is being built with funding support from USDA and a local electric cooperative. Earlier this month, the City of Quinter, Kansas, celebrated the groundbreaking of a new fire station with city employees, members of the volunteer fire department, USDA Rural Development staff, and representatives from Midwest Energy and Quinter Manufacturing & Construction (QMC). This photo was taken by a USDA employee. According to City of Quinter Administrator, Ericka Gillespie, the city of less than 1,000 needed a new fire station because the old facility was not meeting the needs of the community. ?A larger space was needed for training, storage, and additional fire protection equipment and trucks.? The larger fire station will also improve the department's fire rating, resulting in lower insurance costs. ¡°The new fire station will allow us to add to our fleet of fire equipment, and will ultimately help better serve the residents of Quinter and Gove County,¡± said Gillespie. ¡°Our fire department serves the agricultural community as well as the cities in our county, and this new fire station will help us have adequate equipment to help protect our farmer¡¯s crops and the people in the community.¡± The new fire station will be a 5,400 square foot pre-engineered metal building for fire equipment storage that includes bathrooms, changing rooms, and space for a future training room.? In the new facility, there will be room for two fire trucks, and the city is looking forward to adding to its fire protection capabilities. The fire department currently has 13 volunteers, and with the new equipment and facility the city is hoping to attract more volunteers to serve on the fire department. Midwest Energy, an electric cooperative in western Kansas, received financing through USDA¡¯s Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant (REDLG) program to assist the City of Quinter with building the new station.? The cooperative will establish a revolving loan fund through the repayment of this initial loan to the City of Quinter.? As the revolving loan fund is established, Midwest Energy can use that capital for additional community development projects, or to assist for-profit businesses within their service area. ¡°The REDLG program is a great partnership with our local Kansas cooperatives to provide support to our rural entrepreneurs and public bodies,¡± stated USDA Rural Development State Director Patty Clark.? ¡°The new fire station will provide the City of Quinter with an opportunity to expand its fire station to better serve residents in Quinter and surrounding communities.¡± Since , USDA Rural Development has provided $18.5 million to rural Kansas utility companies for economic development in rural Kansas communities.

"Alaskan Forest Floors Sprout Array of Interesting Mushrooms  The fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) sits on the forest floor in Alaska as if it is waiting to be cast in an Alice in Wonderland movie. Its recognizable bright red cap dotted with white warts belies their toxic nature. Although the effects vary, experts warn against eating them.

"Veterans Restore Historic Site on North Carolina's Uwharrie National Forest  Under a new program to help veterans re-enter civilian life and find career-oriented employment, eight military veterans visited the Uwharrie National Forest near Asheboro, N.C. as part of their summer program to gain experience in developing historic preservation skills, they restored a historic site of farm buildings on the forest. ¡°I recognized the importance of preserving these buildings for generations to come and am grateful to be just a small part of the process,¡± said Tyler Price, a veteran and history and anthropology student at California University at Fresno.  Stevin Westcott, National Forests in North Carolina, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Jul 22,   Respond to this story",What conservation efforts can be implemented on historic farmland sites to preserve agricultural heritage?,"1. **Restoration of original farm structures**: Restore or rebuild farm buildings, such as barns and silos, using traditional materials and techniques to maintain their historical integrity. 2. **Soil conservation**: Protect and restore soil health by implementing sustainable farming practices, like crop rotation, cover cropping, and reduced tillage. 3. **Crop preservation**: Identify and preserve heirloom crops or varieties that are significant to the site's agricultural history, through seed banks or controlled environments. 4. **Wildlife habitat creation**: Establish wildlife habitats that promote biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as pollinators, beneficial insects, or fish, which were likely present in the historic farm setting. 5. **Education and outreach**: Develop educational programs, tours, or workshops to share the site's agricultural history with visitors, promoting an understanding of the importance of preserving heritage farming practices. These efforts can be implemented by collaborating with local farmers, historians, conservation organizations, and government agencies to ensure the long-term preservation of historic farmland sites."
"Restoration Efforts May Mean More 'Chestnuts Roasting....'  ¡°Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,¡± is a line from a song that conjures up fond holiday memories for some Americans. For others, the joy of roasting chestnuts has yet to be experienced. But the lack of American chestnuts could change in the coming years, thanks to some very dedicated people. The U.S. Forest Service and its partners may be one step closer to restoring the American chestnut tree to parts of the mountains and forests of the southern United States. Since , they planted close to 1,000 potentially-blight resistant American chestnut trees on national forests in North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.

"Posted by Written by Katie Yocum, USDA Rural Development in  Initiatives  USDA Results  Technology  Jun 11,  While the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is rich in cultural pride, identity and history, its remote location in the rugged terrain of Southeast Oklahoma has severely limited the tribe¡¯s economic development efforts.? But a Broadband Initiative Program grant, made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will enable Pine Telephone Company (PTC) to use innovative wireless technology to deliver affordable broadband service to portions of this rural, remote and economically disadvantaged region in Southeast Oklahoma. During World War II, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma provided an invaluable service to the United States by pioneering the use of Code Talking, using the native Choctaw language, to prevent enemy forces from intercepting the transmission of army secrets. And in , the Choctaw Nation was awarded the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition of support of employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.? So while the Choctaw Nation has shown outstanding compassion for the nation and its tribal members, the local economies of Choctaw communities have suffered tremendously.? Of the five counties on tribal lands that will be served by PTC, all of them are plagued with unemployment rates that soar above the state average and a substantial proportion of residents living below the poverty line. PTC spent years testing broadband technologies that would offer reliable internet service to residents of this remote region, and they determined that advanced 3G technology presents the most viable solution. The system is designed to be scalable and to cost-effectively accommodate technology upgrades, so that it will remain viable for years to come. PTC¡¯s system will offer service to nearly 5,000 households, 10 school districts, and 12 volunteer fire departments and ambulance services. With reliable, high speed wireless access, the region will be able to overcome their geographic isolation to stimulate the sustainable economic growth that it needs.? And offering quality internet access to key community institutions, like schools and public safety bodies, will mean better educational opportunities and enhanced health care and public safety for residents of this region. And in addition to the many benefits to be reaped by members of the Choctaw Nation, this Recovery Act project will also create more than 150 jobs over the multi-year construction period.

"Southwest Regional Assistant WIC Director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 21,  Claudia Crow, a farmer from Shawnee, OK, assists a customer during the Pottowatomie County Famers Market Five-Year Anniversary.  In the hustle and bustle of working for the WIC program in the Southwest Region, I travel quite often, attending meetings and ensuring logistics much like many of my fellow federal and state co-workers. Recently I had the privilege to attend the Pottawatomie County Farmers Market five-year anniversary in Shawnee, OK. Having grown up in a very rural town, representing FNS was a learning experience that reminded me of home. The event was a total success, as the market was full of people including farmers, seniors, families and children. Celebrating five years of service, the event included live music, family and children¡¯s activities, and most important of all: fresh fruit and vegetables. I learned that famers drive hours to sell their crops at the market, and it accounts for as much as over two-thirds of their income. Most farmers market customers swear by the produce bought there, as it is much fresher and lasts longer than normal store-bought produce. In some cases, supermarket produce makes a week-long journey of over 1,500 miles before getting into the kitchen. But the most important part was seeing FNS programs like WIC and SNAP EBT represented. All of the farmers were knowledgeable about Farm to School and Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, and have even started farm tours for children and have working relationships with local schools. Getting fresh vegetables in school cafeterias straight from the farm is great on so many levels! Observing our partnerships at the grassroots stage from farmer to a customer, or farmer to a school sets a tone for the whole region. The relationships I see built are ones that last for years, and I wish the Farmers Market all the best in their future endeavors. Here¡¯s to another five years of successful farming and selling!

"In USDA, there are five types of Departmental Directives: Departmental Regulations, Departmental Manuals, Departmental Guidebooks, Departmental Notices, and Secretary¡¯s Memoranda. DR -001, Departmental Directives System prescribes the policies, responsibilities, standards, and procedures for issuing Departmental Directives. Departmental Regulations (DR). Departmental Regulations (DR) promulgate Departmental policy; delegate authority; establish responsibility; establish statutory or interagency committees; and prescribe high-level procedures governing USDA activities and operations. DRs also may include selected material of an administrative nature that is published in the Federal Register or the Code of Federal Regulations. DRs must be reviewed and revised or reissued at least every 5 years to ensure they remain aligned with current applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements. Departmental Manuals (DM). Departmental Manuals (DM) are used for detailed, relatively lengthy but higher-level technical guidance that is procedural in nature and Departmentwide in scope. Manuals generally are written for ""specialist"" audiences. They provide standards and guidance pertaining to a particular subject or administrative function, generally of the type that must be referred to on a daily or frequent basis. Some manuals implement external agency directives with USDA policy and procedural guidance. DMs must be reviewed and revised or reissued at least every 3 years to ensure they remain aligned with current statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements. Departmental Guidebooks (DG). Departmental Guidebooks (DG) provide guidance and very detailed information which may be more technical or programmatic in nature, which assists in implementing policies found in DRs and processes and procedures found in DMs. DGs may include guides, handbooks, standards, reference books, standard operating procedures, and other similar documents. DGs may not establish policy or impose roles and responsibilities beyond those found in the governing Departmental directive. Unlike DRs and DMs which should remain technology agnostic, DGs may be used to provide highly detailed technology or system specific procedures, instructions, or standards. DGs will be subject to a streamlined formal clearance process (see DM -001) and will provide OPIs with a method to quickly issue enforceable guidance in an agile environment under the Departmental Directives System. DGs must be reviewed and revised or reissued at least every 3 years to ensure they remain aligned with current statutory, regulatory, and/or policy, technical, and standards requirements. Departmental Notices (DN). Departmental Notices (DN) announce: (a) policy or procedure of Departmentwide interest that is temporary or of a onetime nature that addresses a single subject; (b) permanent policy or procedure which requires immediate dissemination and will be codified into a DR or DM within 1 year; or (c) delegations of Authority from the Assistant or Under Secretaries or other General Officers pending publication in the Federal Register. DNs may not be in effect for more than 1 year and cannot be renewed or reissued. Secretary's Memoranda (SM). Secretary¡¯s Memoranda (SM) establish or announce changes in major policy concerning missions and programs of the Department, direct or implement action on Departmental programs, or redirect or change policy or action in Departmental programs. Examples include actions which by law require the endorsement of the Secretary of Agriculture and delegations of authority by the Secretary. SMs may not be in effect for more than 1 year and cannot be renewed or reissued.","What is the minimum frequency at which Departmental Regulations (DR) must be reviewed and revised or reissued to ensure they remain aligned with current applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements in USDA?",At least every 5 years.
"The USDA Departmental Directives system is the online repository of all USDA Departmental Regulations, Notices, Manuals, Guidebooks, and Secretary¡¯s Memoranda. The Departmental Directives system is managed by the Office of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA), Departmental Policy Office (DPO). OBPA DPO facilitates the final editing, review, clearance, and publication process for all Departmental directives. USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices will use the Departmental Directives system to issue policies, procedures, and guidance which have general applicability to employees and two or more agencies or staff offices. Directives that are applicable to only one agency or staff office are not part of the Departmental directives system; those guidance documents are managed by the respective agency or staff office. The Directives system can be accessed by selecting ¡°Directives by Category¡± from the navigation panel on the left of this screen. From that web page, users can find resources for creating and clearing Departmental directives, plain language support, and the listing of all active Departmental Directives.","What is the primary process by which USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices issue policies and procedures related to agricultural practices?","The primary process by which USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices issue policies and procedures related to agricultural practices is through the Departmental Directives system."

"The Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 require agencies to prepare inventories of the commercial and inherently governmental activities performed by Federal employees.

"U.S. Forest Service, Office of Communication in  Forestry  Aug 08,  Researchers prepare for the next phase in examining physical fire processes by adding the effect of a slope. Photo credit: Mark Finney In recent months, we have all become familiar with images in the media of wildland firefighters digging lines, air tankers dropping retardant and fire engines dispersing water. You may wonder ¡°how do these firefighters know what it takes to fight fire?¡± The short answer is: research. Before a wildland firefighter sees his or her first fire, they are given the tools and training on how to fight fire and its behavior. The information passed onto them is not learned overnight but rather through years of research. In the US Forest Service¡¯s Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory, in Montana, employees conduct research on flame, smoke, fuel types and how fire spreads. The lab has six different focus areas including one called the Physical Fire Processes which studies the fundamental physics of fire spread. Another one, Fuel Dynamics, works to make the process of fire behavior and its effects more accurately predictable, and the Smoke Emissions and Dispersion area¡¯s focus is on a better understanding of smoke movement from fires and potential impacts. Other focus areas concentrate on the effects of fire on plants and the study of how a forest responds to fire disturbances and climate change. Fire and firefighting have been around for centuries, so what else can we learn? The answer is a lot. In fact, we learn more each day. For example, in the lab received an award for its research in buoyant flame dynamics in wildfire spread. As everyone knows, fire is hot, but the question that remained unanswered was ¡°how is heat from a fire transferred to other fuels like pine needles so that it spreads?¡± Our lab researchers discovered convection, or hot gasses bursting rapidly forward from the flames, which occurs by contact of air or fluid moving past an object, transferred fire.? Before this discovery, most scientists had considered radiation, the heat we feel from the sun or a fire, to be the key heat transfer mechanism in wildfires. The research showed that flame and hot gasses are forced into contact with new fuels because the rising motion of hot flames actually causes downward flow of cooler replacement air nearby. Thus flames form an alternating pattern of up and down motions along a fire front, and these motions cause the air to spin in the direction wind is moving. After reading about the research our agency has been doing, you might have some ideas yourself, such as having the Forest Service test a new retardant (something that can be very time consuming and expensive).

"Special Projects Coordinator, National Agricultural Library in  Forestry  Dec 16,   Nine days til Christmas. Many of you already have your trees up, I'm sure, but for just as many, if not more, your tree will be making it's way home sometime over the next week. The National Christmas Tree Association estimates that 25-30 million trees are sold in the U.S. each year. All but a tiny percentage of those are grown for harvest on Christmas tree farms in 49 of our 50 states. (The Census of Agriculture indicates no tree farms in Wyoming now, though it had 8 in . I can't say that none exist, only that none are reported. But doesn't that seem odd -- no Christmas tree farms in Wyoming, but 37 in Hawaii? Who would have thought?) As for buying a tree, I know you don't need me to tell you about all the commercial options at your disposal. You probably passed a handful on your latest trip to the grocery store. But if you like the idea of selecting and cutting your own tree, check out this directory of u-cut farms. In addition, many National Forests, particularly in New England and the West, allow you to select and cut your own tree with a pre-purchased permit. (Rules are set and permits sold by regional forests, so do your research before heading out.) Once you get the tree home, follow the resources for keeping it green that my plant-loving colleagues have pulled together. Water, you might guess, is the key. So, what's your favorite type of tree to use at Christmas? Blue spruce? Douglas fir? Scotch pine? Something else? And, dare I ask, are you pro- or anti-tinsel?

"Bear Proofing Your Home: Simple Fix Can Reduce Bear Conflicts  Like the famous cartoon character Yogi Bear, black bears are quick to take advantage of food left out by people. Black bears forage on garbage, bird seed, dog food, and other food items commonly found around homes and businesses. This has led to an increase in conflicts between bears and people in cities and towns across America. Unfortunately, these conflicts often end badly for the bears with many being killed or moved to prevent injuries to people and property damage.  Gail Keirn, USDA APHIS Public Affairs Specialist  Posted in  Animals  Jun 21,   1 Response",What are common food sources that attract black bears to residential areas and how can they be managed to reduce conflicts?,"Common food sources that attract black bears to residential areas include garbage, bird seed, dog food.

"USDA Undersecretary Saddles up for Clean Energy, Business and Economic Development in Nevada  With Nevada USDA Rural Development State Director Sarah Adler as his side-kick, Agriculture Under Secretary Dallas Tonsager hit the trail earlier this month in Nevada, kicking off a major job-creating clean energy announcement, meeting with business owners and talking to ranchers severely challenged by the drought. Tonsager kicked off his trip with a news conference to announce a loan guarantee to Fulcrum Sierra BioFuels to build an advanced biofuels refinery in northern Nevada. The refinery will convert 147,000 tons of municipal solid waste into more than 10 million gallons of advanced biofuels each year, creating 430 jobs during construction and over 50 permanent jobs. He met with state agency representatives interested in capitalizing Nevada small business projects, and met with a USDA Business and Industry loan guarantee recipient ¨C a manufacturer who recently attended a White House conference on manufacturing.  Kelly Clark, USDA Nevada Public Information Officer  Posted in  Rural  Aug 22,   Respond to this story",How can advanced biofuels production from municipal solid waste help mitigate the impact of drought on ranchers and farmers?,"Advanced biofuels production from municipal solid waste can help reduce the demand for water-intensive crops, such as corn and soybeans, that are often used to produce traditional biofuels. By using waste materials instead, land can be preserved for food crop production, thereby mitigating the impact of drought on ranchers and farmers who rely on these crops for their livelihoods."
"Plant to Cut Landfill Deposits, Create Nearly 500 Jobs  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .12  Contact:Jay Fletcher, 690-  WASHINGTON, August 6, - Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced a $105 million loan guarantee to Fulcrum Sierra BioFuels, LLC to finance development of a ground-breaking facility to convert municipal solid waste into advanced biofuels. The project will help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil, relieve pressure on existing and future landfills, and stimulate economic growth in Northern Nevada through job creation.""The time is now to embrace alternative American-produced feedstocks that support our nation's energy independence, provide jobs in rural areas, and support the Obama Administration's 'all of the above' energy strategy,"" Vilsack said. ""At USDA we are focused on the production of renewable energy from a wide variety of non-food sources, including waste, algae, wood, and switchgrass as a long-term solution to America's energy needs. The facility we are announcing today will help create nearly 500 jobs in Nevada and is a perfect example of how producing home-grown energy is good for the economy and good for our energy future.""The Nevada plant is expected to create an estimated orey County, 20 miles east of Reno. Once operational, the plant is expected to convert 147,000 tons of processed municipal solid waste into over 10 million gallons of advanced biofuels annually using a two-part thermo-chemical process.Based in Pleasanton, California, the operator, Fulcrum Sierra BioFuels is a privately held company that focuses on developing facilities that convert municipal solid waste and other waste products to a low-cost, reliable and environmentally clean renewable transportation fuel.USDA, through its Rural Development Biorefinery Assistance Program (Section of the Farm Bill), approved an 80 percent loan guarantee to finance the project, with a conditional commitment that Fulcrum Sierra BioFuels, LLC must meet before loan closing.Today's announcement is part of a larger USDA effort to produce advanced biofuels in every region of the country. USDA has funded 7 additional biorefineries that are using feedstocks like agriculture residue, woody biomass, municipal solid waste, and algae in states from Florida and Michigan to New Mexico. USDA is also investing in research by coordinating with five regional research centers to work on the science necessary to ensure profitable biofuels can be produced from a diverse range of feedstocks. To encourage the production of advanced biofuels from non-food, non-feed sources, USDA has incentivized farmers to grow advanced feedstocks on nearly 60,000 acres, helping companies across the country spur production of new biofuels from non-food, non-feed sources.The Biorefinery Assistance Program, administered by Rural Development's Business and Cooperative Service, is designed to financially assist with the commercial deployment of production technologies to produce advanced biofuels, and thereby increase the energy independence of the United States; promote resource conservation, public health, and the environment; diversify markets for agricultural and forestry products and agriculture waste material; create jobs and enhance the economic development of the rural economy.The Obama administration, with Agriculture Secretary Vilsack's leadership, has worked tirelessly to strengthen rural America, maintain a strong farm safety net, and create opportunities for America's farmers and ranchers. U.S. agriculture is currently experiencing one of its most productive periods in American history thanks to the productivity, resiliency, and resourcefulness of our producers.Creating new markets for the nation's agricultural products through biobased manufacturing is one of the many steps the Administration has taken over the past three years to strengthen the rural economy. Since August , the White House Rural Council has supported a broad spectrum of rural initiatives including a Presidential Memorandum to create jobs in rural America through biobased and sustainable product procurement, a $350 million commitment in SBA funding to rural small businesses over the next 5 years, launching a series of conferences to connect investors with rural start-ups, creating capital marketing teams to pitch federal funding opportunities to private investors interested in making rural and making job search information available at 2,800 local USDA offices nationwide.Since taking office, President Obama's Administration has taken historic steps to improve the lives of rural Americans, put people back to work and build thriving economies in rural communities. From proposing the American Jobs Act to establishing the first-ever White House Rural Council - chaired by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack - the President is committed to a smarter use of existing Federal resources to foster sustainable economic prosperity and ensure the government is a strong partner for businesses, entrepreneurs and working families in rural communities. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio.?? Let¡¯s talk turkey. You¡¯re going to hear a lot about food safety as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, but what you often don¡¯t hear about is how U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists are working to make turkey, chicken and other poultry products safer to eat long before they reach your table.? USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are developing alternatives to antibiotics that can help prevent turkey diseases and reduce bacteria such as Salmonella and Campylobacter¡ªtwo of the main pathogens in poultry that cause foodborne illness in people. While we depend on antibiotics to treat bacterial infections in people, it also is necessary to treat these infections in food animals.? Through U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, USDA works with veterinarians and producers to be more judicious in their antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe. This is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics.? Other USDA work in this area was covered last week during World Antibiotics Awareness Week.? For example, at the USDA-ARS Poultry Production and Products Safety Research Unit in Fayetteville, Arkansas, scientists are studying the effects of adding natural supplements such as yeast and vitamin D to turkey feed to help keep them healthy and control poultry diseases.? In one study, retired ARS microbiologist Geraldine Huff, physiologist Narayan Rath and their colleagues found that adding yeast extract to feed eaten by turkeys could help protect them against Clostridial dermatitis, a disease that causes lesions and sudden death in male turkeys. They concluded that feeding yeast extract¡ªan inexpensive and widely available feed additive¡ªto turkeys can help in managing the disease and keep turkeys heathy.? Finding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply. ??Last week was World Antibiotics Awareness Week.?? Using natural supplements is just one method ARS researchers are exploring to help improve the safety of turkey products that can be enjoyed Thanksgiving and the year round.

With a little help from USDA, consumer-grade photo scanners could revolutionize rice grading. Consumers much prefer whole kernels of milled rice over broken pieces.? Whole kernels offer more consistent cooking qualities and are in many cases considered more visually appealing.? As a result, the price paid to a rice producer for a load of rough rice can be impacted by the percentage of broken kernels within a sample of rice after it has been milled. USDA¡¯s Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration is developing software for use with consumer-grade photo scanners to measure the percent of broken kernels in milled rice quickly and accurately.? ?When rough rice is graded in accordance with USDA¡¯s Rice Grading Standards, the percentage of broken kernels within a sample is determined by a trained grader¡¯s visual inspection. Mechanical sizing equipment instead of visual inspection is routinely used for separating whole and broken rice pieces at various points of the rice marketing process to save time and cost, but mechanical sizing doesn¡¯t account for inherent differences in rice kernel size. USDA¡¯s Rice Studio software rapidly analyzes images of milled rice from a flat-bed scanner.? It identifies fully intact kernels, and then precisely compares fractured kernels with the most similar fully intact kernels to determine whether each fractured kernel is whole or broken.? The program then computes the percentage of broken kernels by weight.? ?The entire process requires less than five minutes.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Oct 01,  Rangeland fires can sweep out of uncontrol across thousands of acres in the Great Basin. Photo credit: ARS Northwest Watershed Research Center, Boise, Idaho Cattle grazing on a nearly half mile wide targeted strip of cheatgrass near Beowawe, Nevada, created a firebreak that helped limit a rangeland fire to just 54 acres this past August compared to rangeland fires that more commonly race across thousands of acres of the Great Basin. The same grazed fuel break held the Boulder Creek Fire in July to just 1,029 acres. This ¡°targeted grazing¡± firebreak and eight others are part of an evaluation project being managed by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), partnering with other federal, state and local agencies and local cattle ranchers in Idaho, Nevada and Oregon. These demonstration sites are being studied so the concept¡¯s efficacy and environmental impacts can be uniformly evaluated and compared. ¡°The basic idea is to use cattle grazing in the early spring to mow extensive strips of highly-flammable cheatgrass down to 2- to 3-inch stubble in strategic places to remove the fuel that can turn small rangeland fires into megafires in a matter of hours. These fuel breaks are intended to slow fire spread, make it less intense, and provides places from which firefighters can more safely attack and contain the fire,¡± explained ARS Rangeland Scientist Pat Clark with the Northwest Watershed Research Center in Boise, Idaho, who directs the project. Clark is tracking how much fuel is reduced by targeted grazing, whether these fuel reductions can be maintained up to the start of the wildfire season, typically July 1 in the Great Basin, and what effects targeted grazing might have on environmental health such as changes in plant composition. Cheatgrass is an invasive annual that dominates more than 100 million acres of the Great Basin in the western U.S. Germinating each winter, cheatgrass grows furiously in spring and dies in early summer, leaving the range carpeted in golden dry tinder. The Great Basin now has the nation¡¯s highest wildfire risk, and rangeland fires are outpacing forest fires when it comes to acreage destroyed. ¡°The most challenging part of the project is getting the targeted grazing treatment applied within the narrow and dynamic window when cheatgrass is palatable and sought out by grazing cattle,¡± Clark said. The duration and timing of that palatability window changes every year, depending on temperatures and soil moisture. The logistics of getting cattle to the right place at the right time and keeping them there is challenging,¡± Clark added. Part of the evaluation project is to look at the impact of targeted cattle grazing on environmental health as well as the effectiveness of the firebreak.

"Research and Development, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 30,  Cattle grazing at sunset in fall on public lands in Malheur County, Oregon, the Steens Mountains are in the distance. (Photo Credit: Greg Shine, Bureau of Land Management) Drought can be a serious game changer for rangeland, wildlife and wildland fire managers. America¡¯s 662 million acres of public rangelands support wildlife like sage grouse, game species like deer and elk, and support rural communities by providing forage for livestock and places to enjoy the great outdoors. This is why ranchers and range management specialists have a long history of working together to assess healthy range conditions. Until recently though, the lack of cost-effective and impartial monitoring of range conditions has been a challenge. In , the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) rose to that challenge when research ecologist Matt Reeves partnered with private industry and developed the Rangeland Production Monitoring Service (RPMS), an online tool for managing healthy rangelands that¡¯s available to everyone. A variety of maps are available through the Rangeland Production Monitoring Service including changes in forage amount and predictions of future forage availability. (Photo Credit: USDA Forest Service) The RPMS features maps and on rangeland forage between and and is updated every year. It also projects available forage in future growing seasons to help with annual operating plans and grazing permits. RPMS proved invaluable in and , when several Arizona counties experiencing severe drought were able to identify where available forage was most affected and planned accordingly. The RPMS application has also helped ranchers qualify for assistance through other programs like the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP), which provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers to address environmental and resource concerns. Reeves worked with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to identify eligible ranchers, and developed a targeted conservation strategy as part of USDA Strategic Goals. The USDA Farm Service Agency is also using RPMS. Through its Livestock Forage Disaster Program, Forest Service permit holders and other producers may receive financial compensation due to forage loss. Users outside the livestock industry have also taken notice. Most recently, wildland fire managers are using the RPMS forage projections to estimate wildfire potential. While fires in national forests capture public attention, rangeland fires can burn just as often and can spread farther and faster than fires on the forest. ¡°We¡¯ve stepped up the game for the fire and fuels folks,¡± said Reeves. ¡°We¡¯re directly translating those projections into fuel so fire managers can make a weekly projection of the fire behavior.¡± Reeves envisions other uses for this , like how rangelands are managed under a changing climate. ¡°As managers and producers, we need to understand the impacts of our management and the climate that¡¯s been unfolding over the last 30 to 40 years,¡± he said. ¡°It¡¯s important to use this information for prioritizing where we might want to change our management scheme.¡± The Huachuca Mountains located in the Coronado National Forest are an example of the rangelands found in southern Arizona.

"A year-long monthly series of climate change science seminars have been developed by USDA¡¯s Office of Energy and Environmental Policy and the USDA Agriculture, Forestry, and Climate Science Working Group. These seminars are designed to provide USDA employees and key Cooperative Extension personnel with the scientific foundations of climate change, and an understanding of how climate change influences USDA¡¯s mission and daily work. The series features leading scientists, both internal and external to USDA, who provide information and respond to questions on a range of climate change related topics, including the foundational science of climate change, the effects of climate change on U.S. croplands, animal agriculture and forests, and the impact of climate extremes on agriculture and forests. These discussions are designed to be of use to USDA conservation, resource management, commodity, and service staff, and accessible to anyone, regardless of their level of familiarity of the subject matter. Climate Change 101: The Foundational Science Dr. Keith Dixon (NOAA) is an award winning science communicator with more than 30 years of experience as a research meteorologist and climate modeler. In the inaugural video of the climate seminar series, Dr. Dixon discusses what is known about our planet's changing climate, how that knowledge is developed, and how certain we are that humans are responsible for the change we are observing.  View on YouTube Climate Effects on U.S. Agriculture and Forests Climate change effects are already evident in U.S. forests and agroecosystems. We are on the cusp of additional and potentially more severe effects, primarily facilitated by increased frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events (drought, heavy rainfall, heat waves) and associated disturbances (wildfires, insect outbreaks).   View on YouTube Climate Extremes in Agriculture and Forests Atmospheric CO2 in the atmosphere is now likely higher than at any point in the last two million years. The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 are interconnected, leading to changes in extremes in both weather and climate. USGS's Dr. Adam Terando discusses the consequences of changes in temperature, precipitation and drought to U.S. agriculture and forests, and approaches to adaptation.

"The Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment, released on ?November ?14, , demonstrates how climate change is affecting America¡¯s working lands, how communities are reducing their risks, and how winning solutions to climate change can be found in productive landscapes. Mandated by the Global Change Research Act of and produced approximately every four years, the U.S. National Climate Assessment provides authoritative scientific information about climate change risks, impacts, and responses in the U.S.? Climate change is affecting agriculture, forests, rural communities, water, and natural resources across the U.S., and will continue to over the next century through changing temperatures, precipitation patterns, drought, flooding, and increasingly more severe extreme events, such as wildfires.?   Climate change affects the livelihoods of USDA¡¯s stakeholders, the economic conditions in which they operate, and the choices they must make regarding their operations in response to changing conditions.   While specific climate impacts vary based on regional conditions and context, no region of the Nation is immune from the impacts of climate change.  Impacts are not limited to U.S. agricultural and forest producers; they are felt globally through the supply chains that depend on working lands in the U.S. They are also felt by consumers in the U.S. who depend on globally-integrated food and forest-product supply chains.  Innovations in adapting to changes in climate show promise and will be central to the future success of working lands. However, frontline, rural, Tribal, and other historically underserved communities are disproportionately affected and may have differing capacities to adapt.   Agricultural and forest production have central roles to play in reducing the intensity of climate change and its impacts over the next century.

"Administrator, Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Jan 20,  USDA¡¯s Food and Nutrition Service is committed to providing equitable access to food to all Americans, but racial disparities in food security still exist. With the rate of food and nutrition insecurity higher among Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations, the bears this out. In response, both USDA and the Biden-Harris Administration have implemented programs targeting racial injustice and inequity in food and nutrition. Since January , FNS has worked tirelessly to combat the impacts of food insecurity and racial inequity by advancing WIC, providing equity in access to SNAP, expanding culturally appropriate meals for children, extending food assistance to American territories, and improving nutrition assistance for Tribal communities. Through these programs, USDA helps millions of Americans of all backgrounds receive access to nutritious foods. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) Self-Determination Demonstration Project, for instance, empowers Tribal Nations with more purchasing options to buy food that better aligns with culture and traditions. Since October , we¡¯ve awarded $3.5 million to eight Tribal Nations. ¡°This project is a big deal. It¡¯s a great showing of how FNS supports the interests of Indian Country to ensure more Tribal people have the chance to partake in Native foods grown by Native people,¡± said FNS Tribal Affairs Specialist Michael Ladd. In Wisconsin, the Oneida Nation and Menominee Indian Tribe have used the FDPIR project funds to purchase tribally procured meats, fish, and apples from the Oneida Nation Farm and the Oneida Nation Apple Orchard.

"Senior Policy Advisor for the Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Aug 18,  Tribal nations across what we now consider the Great Plains relied for millennia on their buffalo relatives for food, medicine, clothing, tools, and shelter. Yet today it is hard to find buffalo meat on school meal trays in the very areas where they once sustained Native communities. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is working with tribal partners to figure out why and to remove the barriers we can. The Biden-Harris Administration and Secretary Vilsack have made it a priority to better meet our federal trust and treaty responsibilities. Historically, the U.S. government played a significant role in the decimation of the buffalo population in the North American continent, with a policy of destroying buffalo in order to starve Native Americans into submission. We recognize the weight of these actions and our obligation to better support tribes in restoring buffalo across their lands. On Monday, June 6, my colleagues at FNS, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Rural Development, Agricultural Marketing Service, and the USDA Office of Tribal Relations, and I were honored to be invited by the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC) and members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to participate in a traditional buffalo slaughter and field harvest. ITBC is a coalition of 69 federally recognized tribes that has led the work to restore buffalo to Indian Country since . Our traditional harvest was led by Lisa and Arlo Iron Cloud who work with Makoce Agriculture Development, an Indigenous agriculture organization led by Nick Hernandez on Pine Ridge. Ms. Iron Cloud is also partnering with USDA¡¯s Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative to help create resources on sustainable, Indigenous food foraging practices. This ¡°hands-on¡± experience was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for which we are so grateful to Lisa, Arlo, the ITBC, and the Oglala Lakota Nation Tribal leadership to get a glimpse into the cultural, spiritual, and practical contributions of buffalo to the Lakota people. We saw first-hand the importance of providing opportunities for American Indian children to engage in hands-on nutrition education about buffalo and to be able to taste and regularly eat buffalo as part of their school meals. FNS has worked to address some of the barriers that make it challenging for schools to serve buffalo, but we recognize that we must do more. We look forward to continuing to partner with ITBC and tribal leaders to advance Indigenous food sovereignty priorities and restore buffalo in Indian Country.

"USDA NASS Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Jun 16,  Farming is hot! From sweet corn to watermelon and apricots to tomatoes, a lot is growing on the farm this summer. Millions of producers across our nation continue to work tirelessly to produce safe and delicious food. According to the latest Census of Agriculture, more than a quarter of these producers are new and beginning farmers, proving that many people are unable to resist agriculture¡¯s magnetic appeal. USDA defines a beginning farmer as anyone who has farmed for 10 years or less. In , the United States had 908,274 producers who identified as beginning farmers, and they accounted for 27% of the country¡¯s 3.4 million producers. How old are these new farmers? The average age of a beginning farmer is 46.3, much younger than the average age of all farmers . Without a doubt, the art and science of producing food attracts people of all ages. If we look for younger farmers, we find 26% of beginning farmers are under the age of 35. The under 35 age group represents only 8% of all U.S. farmers overall. Will more young people find a match in farming as time goes on? Look for an update in the Census of Agriculture. States with the largest share of beginning farmers are mostly on the east and west coasts. However, just as Texas is the state with the most farms and the most producers, Texas leads in the number of beginning farmers.

S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. More than a dozen spotters and equipment operators manipulated the tree into position as the Mack Truck pushed the trailer underneath. The enormity of the Engelmann spruce became apparent as the tree floated above the trailer while a few extra feet from the trunk had to be removed. Every December, the Speaker of the House hosts a lighting ceremony on the U.S. Capitol grounds. With a simple flip of a switch roughly 10,000 lights bring the tree to life. But first it has to make the journey. The progression of the tree across the country may be tracked on the Capitol Christmas Tree website, on their Facebook page and @CapitolTree on Twitter.

(U.S. Forest Service photo) The 88-foot Engelmann spruce tree that will grace the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol as a gift from the people must first get from Colville National Forest in Washington State to Washington, D.C. That means careful packing with special attention paid to cocooning the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree so the thick branches stay intact and nothing hangs over the side of the trailer it is placed on. ¡°What does it take to wrap an 88-foot-tall Engelmann spruce?¡± said Franklin Pemberton of the Colville National Forest. ¡°Also a lot of hard-working volunteers, 4,000 feet of parachute cord with a 550-pound breaking strength and a huge building.¡± The tree wrapping process started at the harvest area on the Colville. Two large industrial cranes gently lowered the tree onto a custom-made cradle atop a special tractor trailer. ¡°The longest of the branches were tied up so they wouldn¡¯t drag on the road for the trip from the harvest site to the Newport (Wash.) celebration and then to the wrapping site,¡± Pemberton said. More than ate to help prep the tree for the journey. ¡°Once at the wrapping site, this is where the sticky, prickly and labor-intensive part of the process starts,¡± he said. ¡°Volunteers start to move the branches towards the center of the tree, using ratcheting straps to move the larger branches into place near the trunk so that the tree will fit inside its protective box trailer.¡± Keeping the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree from drying out is important during the 5,000-mile trip from Washington State to Washington, D.C. The end of the trunk is wrapped with a 40-gallon bladder that is refreshed throughout the trip. The tree needs more than 50 gallons of water each day to stay fresh. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Once those branches are tucked as close as they will go to the trunk, volunteers tie the branches in place with the parachute cord. While doing this, the trees pitch, or sap, covers the volunteer¡¯s hands, clothes and hair making for a sticky, but pleasant smelling ordeal. Once tucked away, the tree is cocooned by aluminum frame and plywood siding. Hoops straddle the top to provide support and protection for a decorative tarp. The only exposed parts of the tree can be seen through three viewing windows. Two of the windows will let onlookers see the top of the tree decorated with lights and a few of the thousands of ornaments created by children in Washington State. The third viewing area will give visitors a chance to see the 40-gallon bladder used to keep the thirsty tree moist and healthy along its trip. The tree will stop in 22 cities on the way to the Capitol. The tree is expected to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Nov. 24. On Nov. 25, the tree will be escorted into Washington, D.C. A tree lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 3. The tradition of a Christmas tree on the U.S. Capitol lawn began in . The first several years live trees were planted but did not thrive.

Since then, a national forest is chosen each year, and residents of the state where the forest in located work together with partners throughout the state to take care of a variety of logistical needs. The community buildup starts roughly a year in advance as a grass-roots community effort to give the gift to all Americans, which is why it is dubbed ¡°The People¡¯s Tree.¡± No tax dollars are used. However, Forest Service employees are assigned to help oversee the project. Follow the tree¡¯s journey. The Capitol Christmas Tree arrives in Colville, Wash. on its cross-country trip.

"Gopher Tortoise Habitats Thrive along Alabama's Gulf Coast  Longleaf pine forests once dominated the Southeast. But over the past two centuries, many of these forests have disappeared along with the wildlife that called them home. Recent efforts to enhance longleaf forests on private lands are helping the ecosystem rebound as well as wildlife like the gopher tortoise. The gopher tortoise is a keystone species of the longleaf forest, known for their deep burrows that provide vital habitat and shelter for not only itself but many other species. The gopher tortoise is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in the western part of the longleaf range, including parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government¡¯s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world¡¯s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack¡¯s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA¡¯s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization¡¯s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA¡¯s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA¡¯s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways. The Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice. The size of the gift matters much less than the fact that each employee participates on some level.

One of the best destinations to visit in New England is the White Mountain National Forest, with its campgrounds, hiking trails, scenic drives, beautiful landscapes and world renowned fall foliage. The forest has recently been adopted by the National Forest Foundation as one of its “Treasured Landscapes,” for its on-the-ground restoration needs due to damage from flooding, woody debris, sediment and erosion caused by Tropical Storm Irene in . In , the Foundation launched its Treasured Landscapes, Unforgettable Experiences campaign to focus on building public-private partnerships in support of large-scale forest and watershed restoration across America’s National Forest System and community engagement. This campaign is concentrated in 14 iconic sites from Alaska to Florida, with the White Mountain National Forest becoming one of the campaign’s newest sites this year. “This new partnership with the Foundation, allows us to continue ongoing watershed restoration, repair trails and bridge damage, and address any spread of invasive plan species caused by the storm” said White Mountain National Forest Supervisor Tom Wagner. Perhaps your next stop during the fall or winter season will be the White Mountain National Forest. Whether you’re a returning or first-time visitor, you must explore this “Treasured Landscape” in New England. NOTE: Recent weather events have impacted some national forests on the East Coast. Campgrounds, roads and trails may be closed because of the storm. Visitors are advised to call ahead to the local ranger district office to find out about forest openings and closures before setting out on a trip.

Youngsters will have an opportunity to enjoy the Shawnee National Forest, like the kids here at the Young Trekkers afterschool program. Photo used with permission. With declining budgets in the public school system, there has been a steady decrease in school fieldtrips in recent years. This plight further widens the disconnect between children and nature. To help bridge the gap between the schoolroom and the natural world, the Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom.  The program will be piloted to third- through fifth-grade students in Union and Alexander counties located in southern Illinois, and will focus on two themes – forest ecology and wetland ecology. Forest Service employees will visit the classroom several times during the semester to cover topics, such as the role of water, the function of wetlands, forest functions, and tree identification, or subjects identified by the teacher.  Naturalist in the Classroom will culminate in a one-day field trip at a Forest Service site with Forest Service natural resource and conservation education professionals to show students how what they learned applies in the field and in national forest management. There will be hands-on activities and games from various national curriculums, such as Project Learning Tree, Project Aquatic Wild and WOW! Wonders of Wetlands will be used. Naturalist in the Classroom aims to strengthen and expand the Shawnee’s environmental education program, get kids outdoors, and assist local educators in meeting Illinois’ learning standards.  Schools benefitting from the program are located in areas with high unemployment and have some of the highest underserved populations in southern Illinois. “We are really excited about implementing this new program in local schools,” said Allen Nicholas, forest supervisor at Shawnee National Forest.  “There are so many barriers to getting children in the outdoors these days.  We hope the Naturalist in the Classroom project will be the bridge in getting kids into the outdoors, as well as connecting them to the expertise of our natural resource professionals.” The spring application deadline is Feb. 5; the fall application deadline is Sept. 5.

"USDA Borlaug Fellow Helps Farmers in His Native Country  Issah Sugri of Ghana is helping his nation feed itself and improve its farmers’ efficiency thanks to a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) program. The Norman E. Borlaug International Agricultural Science and Technology Fellowship Program, funded by USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), is a six to 12 week training program that pairs up-and-coming researchers from selected countries with mentors from a U.S. land-grant institution or government agency. Sugri, one of 36 FAS Borlaug Fellows in , was assigned to the University of Florida with the specific goal of reducing post-harvest losses of tomatoes by better understanding climate-relevant, low-tech methods of extending shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables. When he returned to Ghana, Sugri put his fellowship training to immediate use. Collaborating with fellow researchers at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research – Savannah Agricultural Research Institute (CSIR-SARI), based in Bawku, Ghana, he published fact sheets for local farmers describing optimal harvest and storage conditions. Sugri even included his mobile phone number so he could accept field questions and provide clarification.  He also worked with extension agents to train producers on post-harvest loss avoidance techniques and their economic benefits.

ARS photo  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. News by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) indicates that moving dairy cows out of climate-controlled barns and onto the land may help to lessen the ecological impact of dairy farming without any corresponding loss of production. A team of ARS scientists in University Park, Pa., conducted a modeling study that evaluated how different management systems on a typical 250-acre Pennsylvania dairy farm would affect the environment.  The scientists collected a range of field and input it into their model to evaluate the environmental dynamics of four different dairy farms in all types of weather over 25 years. All four systems were set to produce the same amount of milk, adjusting for fat and protein, on the same land.  The model generated estimates for ammonia emissions from manure, impact on the soil including erosion and leaching of nitrates, and phosphorus losses from field runoff. Total emissions for the greenhouse gases methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were 8 percent lower in year-round outdoor production than with cows tucked away in the barn.  Keeping dairy cows outdoors all year reduced the dairy operation’s ammonia emissions by about 30 percent. While barn-bound cows were estimated to each produce 22,000 pounds of milk per year, compared to only 13,000 pounds per foraging cow, the total amount of milk protein and fat produced was essentially the same.  That’s because the foraging cows produced milk that contained more fat and protein.

"Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Research and Science  Nov 04,  Dr. Woteki works with 4-H members. The past eight years have been an extraordinary time for agricultural science, and for the application of new insights from other fields to enhance agricultural productivity and the overall agricultural economy. As the final days of this administration are approaching, it gives me a great deal of pride to look back at what USDA has accomplished in the areas of research and innovation. Scientific research is a fundamental part of our mission at USDA. But, ultimately, what's behind all the science is people – people who do the research and people who are affected by it. As USDA's Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics, I've met and worked with both as I've traveled across the country and around the world. I've seen the dedication and innovation of researchers at a USDA laboratory in California as they developed uses for drones and laser-guided sprayers as part of a ""precision agriculture"" movement. Their work allows the wise, efficient application of water and chemicals – as well as increased crop yields – in drought-ridden areas. I've seen the confident, solitary efforts of a Cornell University professor in the field of urban aquaponics who, with USDA funding, proved that he can not only raise 10,000 tilapia in fish tanks housed in the unlikely location of a high school basement in midtown Manhattan, but could then recirculate the fish tank water to nourish a thriving edible garden a few floors up in the school building. And I've seen the eagerness reflected in the faces of two young girls taking part in 4-H National Science Day activities in the nation's capital, applying science and technology skills and equipping themselves to possibly become part of the next generation of leaders in agricultural science. These people, and so many before them, embody the commitment to scientific innovation that is a major reason why Americans have not had to worry about food security since the Dust Bowl days of the s. To learn more about USDA's important scientific work, I invite you to take a few minutes to take a look at our results over the past eight years in our USDA Medium Chapter 11: Food and Ag Science Will Shape Our Future. The 21st Century has been referred to as the “Century for Biology,” and we are witnessing the applications of our heightened understanding of genes and gene traits to enhance crops and livestock. These applications, in turn, have been integral to USDA efforts like the transfer of germplasm and new plant varieties to the private sector here in the U.S. We are helping, through USDA’s partnership with the Agency for International Development and the “Feed the Future” initiative, in delivering UG99-resistant wheat varieties and improving the nutritional content of legumes—two examples of how our research and innovation are being applied to help improve food security around the world. Our work has been informed by projections that our global population will reach over 9.5 billion people by the year . To adequately feed that number of people would require an almost doubling of the world’s current level of agricultural production and a reduction in food loss and waste, at the same time the amount of farmable land is decreasing. As we continue to learn about the effects of a changing climate, our focus is on sustainably intensifying agricultural production to deliver the array of foods to provide for good health and foods that are free of disease-causing pathogens and toxins. We have developed a vision of a bioeconomy that by the year will produce a billion tons of biomass – agricultural residues, grasses, energy crops, forestry trimmings, algae and other sources – that will provide alternative sources of fuel, energy and other bioproducts. We have also focused research on developing agricultural systems that will be able to provide all of these services and be resilient in the face of climate change. Over the last eight years. We have faced numerous challenges and the results have been remarkable. There is still much to do, but we have left a solid foundation for continuing USDA’s work to support the American agricultural economy, to strengthen rural communities, to protect and conserve our natural resources, and to provide a safe, sufficient, and nutritious food supply for the American people.

On November 22, the United States and Israel came one step closer to renewing agricultural research and development activities that could produce new knowledge and innovations beneficial to both countries and increase the economic bottom line for farmers and ranchers. Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and Edo Chalutz, executive director of the U.S.–Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD), signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to promote collaboration via NIFA among U.S. and Israeli scientists and engineers. BARD and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s intramural research agency, have cooperated on research together since BARD’s inception. While the MOU does not obligate either agency to specific funding, it offers the framework for facilitating collaborations through the partnership that BARD and the U.S. government have shared since . “The United States and Israel have a shared stake in dryland agriculture, high-value horticultural crops, and pest management. There should be ample opportunity for American and Israeli scientists to jointly continue to advance these and other important areas of science,” Ramaswamy said. One example of cooperation between the nations is water and soil management. Efficiency in water use is of particular interest since the Israelis have worked for years in to develop drip irrigation and have grappled with issues of soil salinity. Many U.S. scientists are conducting similar research, so this may be an area where the MOU could strengthen or begin new collaborative efforts. “This agreement will facilitate many mutual benefits, and we look forward to getting started,” Ramaswamy said. “In fact, we plan to use this MOU as a model for building other important global partnerships.” Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Cooperative Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Aug 22,  USDA’s Agricultural Research Service and Purdue University researchers are working together to develop biological controls that protect against white grubs, which eat turf grass roots. During the U.S. Open held this summer in Erin Hills, Wisconsin, some of the world’s top golfers competed for a shot at becoming the champion (won by Brooks Koepka). The course’s meticulously groomed putting greens and fairways—like those of so many other golf facilities—are an inspiration to lawn-care enthusiasts near and far. But professional golf course superintendents and lawn-loving homeowners alike face a common foe: chubby, C-shaped pests called “white grubs,” which eat the turf grass roots. Unchecked, they cause brown spots or barren patches that mar the turf’s aesthetic value and even playability. Robert Behle isn’t an avid golfer, and you won’t find him competing with his neighbors for the best-looking lawn. But he does know a thing or two about insects—and even more about controlling them using their natural enemies. An Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologist, Behle specializes in ways to formulate naturally occurring fungi and other microorganisms into bio-based pesticides. In fact, he and Purdue University colleague Doug Richmond recently finished a three-year project funded by the U.S Golf Association (USGA) to evaluate the potential of the fungus Metarhizium brunneum to kill white grubs, the larval stages of Japanese, June, and other scarab beetles. The practice, known as “biological control,” is one that’s already found its way onto some golf courses. Indeed, a survey by the Environmental Institute for Golf found that 42 percent of 27-plus-hole golf facilities sometimes or frequently use biocontrol in their pest management practices. The researchers used an ARS patent-pending process called “liquid culture fermentation” to mass-produce the fungus and turn it into clay granules, which they applied at different rates to grub-infested turf grass plots at Purdue University. When they rolled back patches of the turf, a grizzly sight awaited them. Depending on the rates applied, 50 to 70 percent of the grubs lay dead beneath the soil, covered in a fuzzy growth that confirmed the fungus had infected and killed them—typically 7 to 10 days after exposure. An insecticide applied to different plots worked even faster, killing 95 percent of the grubs. However, when used in the fall, the chemical had lost some of its “punch” against larger-sized grubs compared to the fungus, which worked better with the cooler temperatures.  The findings, which the researchers published in a USGA annual report, could help golf course superintendents identify ways to use the fungus as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which combines judicious insecticide use with cultural, biological and other controls. Golfers needn’t be distracted by the prospects of this biocontrol fungus quietly working underfoot, though. Its absolute preference for infecting white grubs and other insect turf eaters means people, pets and wildlife won’t suffer the same fuzzy fate as these pests.

"International Programs Office, USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Trade  Oct 20,  In Nigeria, NASS representatives Matt Deaton, Terry Holland and John Campbell worked with Kaduna State Agricultural Development Programme, National Bureau of Statistics Federal Department of Agriculture to develop a stronger national agricultural statistics program. Today the United Nations is celebrating the first World Statistics Day, to raise awareness of official statistics, which are premised on the core value of service, professionalism and integrity. As one of the principal statistical agencies in the U.S., the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has been heavily involved in establishing and improving agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II. Food insecurity, shortfalls in regional food production and lack of reliable information on the agricultural sector are major concerns in many countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information to address these issues. This is why, over the past 10 years, NASS international projects have been instrumental in helping more than 30 developing and emerging market countries in Africa, Central and South America, Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe to develop and improve their agricultural statistics programs. Using our experience in conducting the census of agriculture, NASS is currently working with the Armenian National Statistics Service and the Ministry of Agriculture to conduct a full count of agriculture in Armenia. It has been 90 years since Armenia conducted its last census of agriculture. The upcoming census will also be Armenia’s first since the country gained its independence in . In addition to the Armenian census of agriculture, NASS is also currently working with the governments in Georgia, Brazil, Mongolia, Nigeria and Serbia. Our agency is also gearing up to start a new project in Moldova. We work to provide all of these countries with technical assistance and training on a reimbursable basis in all aspects of statistical surveys and systems. The benefits of such assistance extend beyond serving the interests of the various countries. By helping other countries improve their agricultural statistics systems, USDA’s ability to assess world food and fiber production is also improved. Establishing strong working relationships with other agricultural statisticians around the world allows NASS staff to gather and develop new ideas for improving the U.S. agricultural statistics system, while exposure to other cultures and work situations enhances our employees’ abilities to solve problems.

"USDA Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 09,  A new poll shows that parents of school-age children overwhelmingly support national nutrition standards for all foods and beverages sold to students during the school day. For more information, visit: www.pewtrusts.org/SchoolFoodParentPoll. Click to enlarge. Over the past four years, USDA has worked closely with schools, parents, community leaders, and nutrition experts to ensure that when children go off to school, they are greeted by a healthier school environment.  According to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, leading to an increase in obesity-related health outcomes in children, including cardiovascular disease, pre-diabetes, and bone and joint problems.  Improving school nutrition is vital to reducing childhood obesity, because many children consume half of their daily calories during the school day. Making the healthy choice the easy choice sets our nation’s children up for a lifetime of healthy choices, and supports a healthier next generation.  Recently, we’ve seen evidence that student acceptance of healthier meals is increasing across all grade levels.  Today, we are pleased to see the results of the latest poll by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Heart Association, showing that most parents support the healthier meal and snack standards implemented through the Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of .  Read more about the results of that study in this guest blog, from the American Heart Association. A majority of parents favor strong national nutrition standards for food and drink sold at schools, according to a poll released Monday by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Heart Association. In addition, the poll found that parents would also like to see salt limited in school foods and more fruits and vegetables served. The poll, which was conducted in June among 1,112 parents, said that 80 percent of the parents said they were concerned about their children’s health. Seventy-four percent said they were concerned about childhood obesity, a major risk factor for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and cardiovascular disease later in life. Currently, more than one third of children and adolescents are clinically overweight or obese. Among children ages six to 11, obesity rates rose from 7 percent in to 18 percent in . The rates increased from 5 percent to 21 percent during that same period for youth ages 12 to 19. Childhood obesity has been a major national focus, with federal agencies and advocacy organizations, including the American Heart Association, working on ways to curb the trend. The poll was conducted just weeks before the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued “Smart Snacks” standards on July 1, which mandated that school snacks must be a fruit, a vegetable, protein, dairy, or whole grain; have fewer than 200 calories; and be low in fat, salt, and sugar. The poll revealed that support for stricter school nutrition standards cut across racial and political lines. Sixty-eight percent of whites, 85 percent of Hispanics and 91 percent of African-Americans said they support the standards. Fifty-six percent of Republicans, 71 percent of independents and 84 percent of Democrats favored stronger standards. Only 22 percent of parents expressed that they strongly opposed higher school nutrition standards. Among the poll’s other findings: 72 percent favor national standards for school meals; 72 percent support standards for school snacks; 91 percent support requiring schools to include a serving of fruits or vegetables with every meal; 75 percent think salt should be limited in meals; 23 percent believed food sold a la carte at schools was nutritious, whereas only 8 percent believed the same of food sold in vending machines. Penny Kris Etherton, PhD, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, said the findings are encouraging, but parents voicing support is just the beginning. “Schools and parents need to be on the same page about what the kids eat,” she said. “You can’t have one set of standards at school and another set of standards at home. It’s encouraging to see that parents are supportive of higher nutritional standards, but we need to educate across the board so that parents understand what this really means for how their kids should eat.” Reducing sweetened beverages can lower a child’s intake of “empty” calories, Kris-Etherton explained. However, some parents might believe fruit juice is healthy “when it’s really just sugar water. The child would be better off either drinking plain water or eating a piece of fruit to get the fiber and nutrients from the fruit. The challenge will be making healthy eating fun and interesting for kids.” The poll was conducted by Hart Research Associates and Ferguson Research.  Pew, RWJF, and AHA are jointly supporting efforts to ensure all foods and beverages in schools are healthy. The Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project is a collaboration between Pew and RWJF. Voices for Healthy Kids is an initiative of RWJF and AHA, with Pew providing additional expertise.

"USDA Economic : Building Blocks for Policy  About midway through USDA’s 150-year history, federal officials decided that economic research and analysis could be a valuable, objective tool in helping farmers – and policymakers - grapple with farm price and income issues. In , the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) – predecessor agency of USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) – came into existence. The Bureau began regularly producing agricultural market outlook (still an ERS staple), and - not surprisingly - its early work included analysis of agricultural policy impacts during the Great Depression.

At noon each day, the students line up and eagerly wait for their turn to get their plate full of rice and split peas thanks to USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes). The McGovern-Dole Program supports education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. It provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as financial and technical assistance for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects. Currently, USDA funds 36 active agreements with 17 cooperating sponsors in 28 countries, assisting more than five million beneficiaries. To date, the Program has provided meals to more than 22 million children. Since , Catholic Relief Services, with the help of the McGovern-Dole program, has played a large role in improving the lives of children and their families in Mali, a country with a population of more than 12.5 million. The United Nations recently reported that 10 percent of the total population was undernourished and that 38 percent of pre-school aged children are physically stunted. In light of Mali’s situation, this McGovern-Dole project has enhanced the welfare of targeted communities through improving access to food and education for children. By the end of the fiscal year, the CRS/Mali program had directly impacted the lives of over 45,000 individuals in Mali. In promoting the health of students, teachers, and school cooks, more than 5 million meals, as well as vitamins and medications, were distributed among 120 schools. Nearly 2,000 members of school management committees supported by the program participated in literacy sessions and radio broadcasts about the importance of education. Through these efforts, overall school enrollment in targeted communities has increased from 26 percent to 32 percent for boys and from 39 percent to 55 percent for girls since the program began in . In May , the Obama administration unveiled the Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative. The Initiative supports the international effort to increase the availability and accessibility of food and to improve nutrition and food safety. It serves as a springboard for broader economic development and food security. It also serves as a foundation for peace and opportunity in developing countries, which ensures our own national security. USDA is working with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and international organizations to help implement the Initiative. The McGovern-Dole program is one way USDA leverages its resources to support Feed the Future. The Program has played a critical role in enhancing the livelihood of Malians and will remain a bright spot in food assistance and education in communities around the world.

"USDA Pennsylvania Public Information Officer in  Rural  Feb 14,   Snow didn't stop the ideas from flying as members of the Northern Tier Regional Planning and Development Commission (Northern Tier) and their partners from Bradford, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Tioga, and Wyoming Counties met in Pennsylvania last month. Northern Tier is leading the regional group that was awarded the opportunity to participate in the Stronger Economies Together (SET) training and technical assistance program, sponsored by USDA Rural Development in conjunction with the Northeast Regional Rural Development Center and Penn State Extension. The SET program is a nationwide effort focused on working with regional groups to encourage and strengthen regional thinking and developing information and strategies to address issues affecting the region. The training will cover nine course modules on “Strategies for Building New Economic Opportunities” which will be completed by next year. Marcellus Shale was the topic, but the conversation wasn't about the money and jobs the industry has brought to the area. The conversation was about how to measure the economic impact of Marcellus Shale, keep the dollars in the region, and create a sustainable economy. The Northern Tier realizes the way to achieve sustainable results and best utilize area resources is regional collaboration. The foundation created on that snowy morning will be the building blocks of the region's future success. This effort is a great example of how Rural Development has brought leaders and stakeholders in several communities together to collaborate on how to improve the quality of their community.

"AMS Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program Deputy Administrator in  Conservation  Jan 27,  Livestock correlations, like the one held at Penn State, are one way that USDA Market News ensures the accuracy and consistency in its . The correlation allowed reporters to compare live animal assessments and grades with the post-slaughter assessment and grades of the same animals. During its 100 years of serving the livestock industry, USDA Market News – part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – has prided itself in creating transparency and clarity in the marketplace by allowing all industry stakeholders to have the same information about the market at the same time.  The entire agricultural supply chain relies on USDA Market News for timely, unbiased .  Without this free service, information would not be available to everyone equally, making USDA Market News a vital lifeline for America’s agricultural economy. Over the years, countless changes have occurred in the livestock industry – like the way that livestock standards are applied and the way market reporting is conducted.  To keep up with these changes, livestock correlations are held to assure the industry that all USDA market reporters are applying the USDA’s livestock grades and standards consistently and accurately. AMS develops, maintains and interprets USDA’s livestock grades and standards – like the Prime, Choice or Select grades used for beef.  USDA grades and standards ensure uniformity in products and quality, as well as in USDA’s market published across the nation.  Grades and standards provide a common trade language that ranchers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers are familiar with and rely on to buy and sell effectively. Recently, a group of market reporters from the Livestock, Poultry, and Grain Market News division attended a livestock correlation at Penn State University facilitated by its on-campus meats laboratory.  At Penn State, market reporters evaluated a pen of cattle and a pen of lambs and assigned the appropriate livestock quality and yield grade, while veteran market reporters spoke about the animals’ distinguishing qualities.  The Penn State campus offered a unique venue for the correlation, having a full meat processing and cutting facility right on campus. The next day, the market reporters returned to Penn State to correlate their live animal grade designations from the previous day to the same animal’s post-slaughter grade designations, comparing and correlating their findings to check consistency and accuracy in their findings. Livestock correlations are just one way that USDA Market News upholds its commitment to accuracy and consistency in its .  Market reporters understand that in order for their to be as meaningful as possible, a Choice grade steer in Georgia needs to be comparable to a Choice grade steer in Iowa, just as a Prime lamb in Pennsylvania has to be equal to a Prime lamb in Colorado. This uniformity, strengthened by the continuous work of market reporters, makes USDA Market some of the most trusted and respected in the world.

"Big Impact from a Small Kitchen  I recently traveled to Columbus, Ohio with Farm Service Agency (FSA) Administrator Val Dolcini and stopped by Southside Roots Café, Market and Kitchen for lunch. The restaurant makes delicious food from locally-sourced seasonal ingredients, but what really sets it apart is how it charges customers for that food. Southside Roots Café uses a pay-what-you-can approach that allows everyone to eat nutritious, delicious food, regardless of their income. Housed in a former school building owned and operated by the Mid-Ohio Food Bank, the café and an adjacent fresh food market provide fresh, affordable, nutritious food to the local community.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

"Administrator, USDA Rural Housing Service in  Rural  May 12,  New home loan processing is saving customer and staff time, taxpayer money and lots of paper. (Click to enlarge) This has been the year of innovation at USDA Rural Housing Service. We are working smarter, faster, more efficient and environmentally conscious than ever before.  After years of brainstorming, planning, reengineering, testing, and training, RHS has realized its vision: the Section 502 Guaranteed Single Family Home Loan Program now operates paperless, and we’re saving more than we ever imagined possible. USDA’s Rural Development State field offices now transact business with private lenders via Web-based uploads and electronic signatures.  This means RHS and our private partners are no longer printing and sending hundreds of pages of paper back-and-forth every time a loan guarantee is used to help a rural American family buy their home. As a result, loan guarantees are processed faster and families move into homes more quickly. Postage fees will be eliminated and huge print jobs avoided for every one of the 140,000+ home loans USDA guarantees we will make in the coming year. Initial estimates show USDA Rural Housing Service will save 37,500 reams of paper every year now that we do more business in a paperless environment. More than 135,333 staff hours per year nationwide were being spent managing these paper processes. Staff will have more time to assist our customers, connect with potential partners and, of course, help more rural Americans buy their own homes through our 502 homeownership programs. All of the savings in time, paper and postage adds up to some serious savings of American tax dollars. In fact, we estimate RHS will save more than $4.2 million in just one year of using the new process nationwide.  This means we can allocate more time and money into oversight initiatives that will work to ensure lender compliance, and more adequately staff other Single Family Housing Programs to better serve Rural America. The people who work in the Rural Housing Service are proud of this milestone! But, as they like to remind everyone, RHS is just getting started.  Innovation projects of this sort have begun to touch every one of the Agency’s programs. RHS is advocating for the American dream of homeownership by working smarter, faster, more efficiently, and more conscious of the environment than ever before.

"USDA Rural Development Utilities Service Administrator in  Initiatives  Rural  Technology  May 27,  Anita J. (Janie) Dunning, Missouri State Director, and Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator (center), painting the Ralls County PWSD No. 1 water tower A three day visit to Missouri, the “Show Me State” allowed me to join Janie Dunning, Rural Development State Director, to see how rural areas benefiting from infrastructure investments made possible through USDA Rural Development programs and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) financing. My trip started on Wednesday, May 18, , with a visit to Socket Telecom, LLC in Columbia, MO.   We learned of their progress on a $23.7 million Rural Utilities Recovery Act investment for high speed fiber-to-the-home broadband access to 2,700 homes, 36 critical community institutions and 270 businesses in Callaway County.  That afternoon, as a member of President Obama’s White House Business Council on “Winning the Future,” I facilitated a roundtable discussion with 20 community and business leaders of Mexico, MO, hosted by Frank Cordie of Mid America Brick. When you think of “bricks and mortar” for cementing economic development, there is no better place than in America’s heartland at a brick plant.  I gathered feedback on ways we can help businesses expand, create jobs, and improve the economic base in their area.  The roundtable was followed by a very interesting tour of the brick plant to see how the $10 million from the agency’s Business and Industry guaranteed funds was being used to bring this regional business icon back to life. Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator; Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Jay Nixon, Governor of Missouri; Dan Strode, President/CEO of Ralls County Electric Cooperative. The next day, I joined Missouri Governor Jay Nixon for a “light up” ceremony at Ralls County Electric Cooperative (RCEC). They were celebrating the construction and hooking up the first customers of $19.1 million project, funded by USDA under the Recovery Act, to serve 4,600 households, 300 business and 58 anchor institutions in northeast Missouri.  I found most interesting is that the RCEC is reinvesting 10 percent of their earnings from the broadband investment for economic development opportunities for individuals and businesses in their service area.  This ceremony was followed by a working lunch to discuss other broadband opportunities with Damon Porter, Governor Nixon’s point-man on broadband. My next stop was to Ralls County Ralls County Public Water Supply District No. 1 to visit the site of water improvements including a new 250,000 gallon water tower.  Janie and I grabbed paint brushes and assisted with painting the water tower support.  Yes, that was a first for me. That evening the Missouri state office staff hosted me in a discussion with Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Electric Cooperatives and other electric cooperative leaders to talk about partnering strategies to assist rural Missourians. My third day, included a tour of USDA funded Water and Wastewater projects in Howard County.  First stop was to a state of the art, environmentally friendly lagoon at the City of Fayette.  I was very impressed with this new technology and treatment of waste water.  One of the stages in the water treatment includes a process in a lagoon covered with a heavy duty rubberized material. I made a closer inspection of the rubberized material and verified that it was strong enough for opportunity for me to “walk on (waste) water”!  This may be a first for an Administrator. Jonathan Adelstein, USDA Utilities Administrator, walking on (waste) water at the City of Fayette lagoon. The next stop was to see another investment to the City of Fayette for improvements to their water system including the construction of a new water tower.  The last stop was for a celebration of strategies supported by President Obama and Secretary Vilsack for regionalization.  The Howard County Regional Water Commission was established as a regional water waste supply and treatment system to serve three public water systems in the southern part of Howard County including: the City of Fayette, the City of New Franklin and Howard County PWSD No. 1. It was definitely a packed three days but gave me a great appreciation for the hard work that the Missouri Rural Development staff perform in administering programs and “yes” they did “Show Me” some wonderful examples of our programs benefiting rural Missourians!

"Students Turn Science Teachers for 4-H National Youth Science Day  I went back to school yesterday. And my teachers were fourth graders. Fourth grade students at Hearst Elementary School in Washington, DC taught me and 200 other students about climate change, water quality and carbon footprints through the 4-H National Science Experiment.  All across the country and world, hundreds of thousands of students were doing the same set of experiments today as part of 4-H National Youth Science Day.  We saw how carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere and what its effects can be.  Watching students make connections between their actions and the environment was really exciting for me, and with a sixth grader of my own, it was fun to experience science with these students and get a glimpse of how empowering science can be for these youngsters.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 03,  In addition to purchasing blueberries for federal food distribution programs, AMS supports the blueberry industry through grant programs like the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council. Blueberries are often highly sought after because of their long list of health benefits and their sweet taste. Whether purchased fresh, frozen, or pureed, the blueberry has long been a staple in the diets of many people. Every July, the entire nation celebrates Blueberry Month by coming up with creative recipes and other unique ways to get their fill. Here at USDA, every month is Blueberry Month. One of the ways that we show our appreciation for our nation’s blueberry producers and processors is by creating more opportunities for people to enjoy this delicious fruit. Indigenous to North America, the history of blueberries can be traced all the way back to Native Americans, who added them to soups, stews, and even meats. Highbush or cultivated blueberries are grown on large bushes that are planted in rows. These blueberries are often sent to the fresh market. Lowbush or wild blueberries produce smaller sized berries and are pruned every couple of years. The majority of lowbush blueberries are processed into items like jams, jellies and baked goods. My agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), does its part to help more people eat these little blue dynamos.® Through our Commodity Procurement Program, we purchase frozen cultivated and wild blueberries. The purchases send this highly nutritious food to school children, families, and communities through federal food distribution programs like the National School Lunch Program. In , we bought nearly $17.9 million or 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries. This provided a reliable outlet for producers in places like Maine where 98% of the nation’s wild blueberries are harvested. As a result of this purchase, states like Maine can continue to strengthen their rural economies. Our purchases are also making a big difference in states like New Jersey -- the birthplace of the cultivated blueberry. The state’s blueberry industry produced more than 51 million pounds that  yielded nearly $81 million in revenue in . This was by far the largest revenue generator in the Garden State’s fruit and vegetable sector that year. In , AMS helped continue this trend by buying $18.4 million or 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country. In addition to our purchases, AMS supports the blueberry industry by offering grants to help it remain competitive in the marketplace. Classified as specialty crops, blueberries are eligible for grants through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. So, thanks to Specialty Crop Block Grant funds, several state agriculture departments can conduct research to mitigate the damage to its blueberry crops created by the Brown Marmorated Stinkbug and other invasive pests. Whether it’s July or any other part of the year, AMS is committed to supporting our nation’s blueberry producers and processors. We recommend that you add some color to your plate with some blueberries. The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council’s website has some great recipes to get you started.

"Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Services, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Mar 18,  An owl seems to plead for help after getting stuck in a vault toilet. A movement to save birds from serious injury and death garnered a Wings Across the Americas Award for the Teton Raptor Center of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and employees from several national forests. (Photo courtesy Teton Raptor Center) Small owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards. They prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death. The resolution that could save thousands of birds resulted in an award from Wings Across the Americas, a program of the U.S. Forest Service and its partners to conserve birds, bats, butterflies and dragonflies across all landscapes and boundaries. The project received the Habitat Management and Partnership Award, shared with Forest Service employees and the Teton Raptor Center in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Many public agencies use vault toilets to manage sanitary waste on their lands, and the ventilation pipes seem to attract the birds. The small owls enter the hole at the top of the vent, fall down the vertical pipe and land in the waste holding reservoir. The small size and weight of the birds make it impossible for them to gain any lift to escape. In , the Teton Raptor Center heard about the problem and decided to do something. Roger Smith, founder of Teton Raptor Center, said a photo of an owl peering up from the reservoir made him realize the need for “…a real, tangible conservation project that people could understand and commit to – preventing bird mortality from a man-made problem by covering the hole with a screen.” As a non-profit organization with a mission focused on conservation, education and rehabilitation, the Teton Raptor Center resolved to launch a public awareness campaign:  the Port-O-Potty Owl Project. Of course, it quickly gained the nickname “Poo-Poo Project.” Unbeknownst to Smith was the collaboration between Gerardo Chavarria, a Forest Service regional engineer based in Denver, and Greg Hayward, an agency wildlife ecologist working in Alaska. Hayward sought out Chavarria because he wanted an engineering fix to prevent the bird deaths. “His concern was contagious and provided a challenge for me to investigate if there was a cost effective way to screen the toilet vent stacks without too much negative effect on air flow out of the stacks.” he said. Chavarria used his engineering skills to design a screen that would not adversely affect the functional design of a vault toilet. In fact, his work helped to advance the quick fixes the raptor center sought on vault toilets on three national forests in Wyoming. Chavarria’s advance research determined the types of screen that would work, which allowed the raptor center and the Forest Service to immediately cap the toilet vents. Because the need and resolution were already pre-determined, Forest Service employees Joe Harper of the Shoshone National Forest, Tammy Fletcher of the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and Bernadette Barthelenghi of the Bridger-Teton National Forest could more quickly answer the raptor center’s call. Harper brought the awareness of what happened to the birds to the forest, and all vault toilets are now screened and any new toilets and pipes also will be screened. Fletcher helped to secure grant funding to purchase screens for the Caribou-Targhee and all participating land agencies within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. And Barthelenghi made the work possible on her forest and worked to ensure the project and solution were shared with all agency offices. Joe Alexander, forest supervisor on the Shoshone, said they partnered with community organizations to help install the necessary screens.  Local chapters of the Audubon Society and Boy Scouts engaged on this real world problem and helped to make a difference. “The Shoshone National Forest prides itself on being the leader in conservation,” Alexander said. “After implementation of these new toilets it became apparent that some small efforts could go a long ways in protecting our avian resources. The Wings Across the Americas awards were presented March 12 during the 79th North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference. Other award winners are: The Barto Fen Restoration Project on the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri received the first Dragonfly Conservation Award for one of the largest and most genetically diverse populations of this dragonfly. The Monitoring and Conservation of Black-Backed Woodpecker in Burned Forests project received the Research Management & Partnership award. Since , several organizations, including the Pacific Southwest Regional Office of the U.S. Forest Service and the Institute for Bird Populations, worked to better integrate the habitat needs of the bird into forest management plans. The Bat Cave Gating Project on the Mark Twain National Forest also received the Bat Conservation Award. The forest is home to a large gray bat maternity colony, and the project’s goal is to protect the bats by closing nearby trails and installing chute gauges and flyover gates at entrances of bat maternity caves. The Migratory Shorebird Project: Connecting Communities of the Americas through Research for Conservation received the International Cooperation Award. The project looks at two species, the Western Sandpiper and the Pacific population of the Dunlin, measures their response to management actions, studies what influence population changes and educates people on the importance of wetland resources all along the Pacific Coast of the Americas. The University of Minnesota Monarch Lab received the Communities in Conservation award.  For more than 20 years, the lab has linked academic research with community outreach programs associated with monarch conservation.

"Forest Health Protection, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 05,  Removing mud and seeds from your shoes can help prevent the spread of invasive plants and animals. (Photo by Kim Lanahan-Lahti, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry) For years now, the U.S. Forest Service has been encouraging visitors to our nation’s forests and grasslands, to not only enjoy all there is out there, but to play safe and play clean. One example of this outreach effort is the PlayCleanGo: Stop Invasive Species In Your Tracks campaign. PlayCleanGo has 130 partners, all fostering active participation in actions designed to interrupt recreational pathways of spread for invasive species. By becoming a partner, you can spread the message to stop invasive species in your tracks. “PlayCleanGo is designed to give outdoor recreationists a clear call to action to be informed and attentive in helping stop the spread of invasive plants and insects and improving overall forest health,” said Monica Lear, U.S. Forest Service Forest Health Protection Director. “These pests can expand like a different kind of wildfire, from forest to forest by unsuspecting visitors just looking for some fun and adventure.” From camping to fishing to hiking, getting outside and into nature is one of the many activities that our forests support. Outdoor recreation provides physical challenges, contributes greatly to the physical and mental health of individuals, provides economic benefits to communities, and has become an essential part of American culture. PlayCleanGo is helping these recreationists preserve the land they already love and enjoy. Through positive messaging, the program provides simple steps people can take to avoid accidently spreading invasive species.  This advice includes letting visitors know to stay on designated trails, remove mud and seeds from shoes and gear, and burn only local or certified firewood. For example, garlic mustard, an aggressive plant invader of wooded areas throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern US, can form dense stands and displace native species by competing for available light, nutrients and water resources. Garlic mustard seeds stick together when damp and adhere readily to small soil clusters, making it easy for them to stick to muddy boots, pant cuffs, and animal fur. Through easy actions like inspecting hiking equipment, clothing, and pets before going out on a hiking trail and conducting the same inspection upon leaving the trail, the PlayCleanGo campaign is helping slow the spread of invasive species. PlayCleanGo was launched by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in partnership with the University of Minnesota Extension, Minnesota departments of Agriculture and Transportation, and Explore Minnesota. Creating a new and successful awareness campaign, like Smokey Bear and his fire prevention message, depends on broad, frequent exposure to the public. For this reason, PlayCleanGo invites public and private organizations to join the effort by becoming a partner.

The team has made it to the World Series the last two seasons: losing to the San Francisco Giants in and participating in the thrilling, nail-biting autumn classic of against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ryan also knows the value of the USDA shield. He’s the head of the Nolan Ryan Guaranteed Tender Beef Program, a marketing program verified by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). AMS relies on university-researched and industry-recognized standards to determine which marketing claims it chooses to verify. Companies like Ryan’s can approach AMS and request the agency verify marketing claims such as “guaranteed tender” to assure customers that the products listed on packaging are exactly what they claim.  This is an important service to consumers who desire a certain quality of beef and want third-party assurance that their beef purchases meet exacting requirements. _________________________________________________________________________________________ USDA Certified – St. Louis (Cardinals) Style If you bellied-up at a local sports bar and ordered a plate of St. Louis Style ribs while watching the World Series, thank a former USDA employee for naming the cut of pork. In the late s Steve Olson, an agricultural marketing specialist in the USDA Livestock and Seed Program’s Standardization Division, wrote meat standards for the Agricultural Marketing Service’s Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS). Last June Olson shared his story about naming the cut of meat with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He explained how some butchers fancied carving off the breast bone and brisket bones from pork spareribs. “We did a survey to find out if there was a consensus for what this was called,” Olson told the Post-Dispatch. A majority of the respondents called it a St. Louis cut. “The only reason I went ahead and put the term into the IMPS is because I happen to be an avid St. Louis Cardinals baseball team fan, and they had just defeated the San Francisco Giants in a playoff,” Olson said. For more specifications, you can view the latest IMPS report. On pages 11 and 32, Item No. 416A is listed as “Pork Spareribs, St. Louis Style.” St. Louis ribs, ready to eat.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 24,  Bat Week graphic. By the time October comes around, store shelves are stocked with Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations. Bats are often situated among this imagery, whether as silhouettes in the background or as blood-sucking monsters. But bats are none of these things. They are primarily nocturnal, they make their homes in dark places, but there’s nothing scary about them. That is why Bat Week, October 24-31, is a time to celebrate bats, what they contribute to our society, and to dispel the myths that cause so much misunderstanding of these gentle, intelligent creatures. There are more than 1,300 species of bats worldwide, and they are diverse. Some, like Kitti’s hog-nosed bat, also known as the bumble bee bat, can be as small as your thumbnail and survives on insects. Others like the flying fox eat fruit and have earned their name due to their impressive size. Bats like this Mexican free-tailed bat feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. Photo by MerlinTuttle.org. There are three species of vampire bat among those 1,300. However, they live in Mexico, Central and South America; feed primarily on large livestock; and take about an ounce of blood in a feeding. Forty-seven species of bat call the United States home. Bats provide valuable services to us. Most feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. The various species of beetles, moths, and other insects that often plague crops represent a tasty meal to a hungry bat. In fact, it is estimated that if bats were lost in North America, savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture. In one case, a Georgia pecan farmer was able to abandon pesticide use altogether after he built bat houses housing several thousand Mexican free-tailed bats. The Forest Service is looking into the role that bats play in pest insect control on the forest as well. Many insects, like bark beetles and gypsy moths, can be devastating to forests, and as voracious insect eaters, bats have the potential to help cull their numbers. Recognizing the role they play, the Forest Service has long been a champion of bat conservation. Over the last decade, the fungal disease white-nose syndrome has killed more than six million bats. While Forest Service researchers seek a solution to white-nose syndrome, the agency’s land managers explore improved ways to manage bat habitat. Within the 193 million acres of forests and grasslands that the agency manages, there are more than 25,000 abandoned mines that present both opportunity and hazard. Recognizing the potential of abandoned mines as ideal roosting, hibernation, or maternity sites, the Forest Service has constructed “bat gates” that provide a grating to keep visitors from stumbling into a potential hazard while allowing bats to fly freely. You too can make a big difference by planting bat-friendly gardens, building bat houses, and helping dispel myths about bats. Little Brown bats found in Maine with white-nose syndrome.

"Rural  Jul 19,   Story and Photos by Phil Eggman, USDA Rural Development, Washington State Office Donating a little bit of time can go a long way to making a big difference for people. Just ask the employees of USDA Rural Development in Washington State who, on July 13, donated two hours of their time at the end of a hectic day to make food packages for the elderly, young mothers, infants and children at the Thurston County Food Bank located in downtown Olympia. According to Thurston County Food Bank Executive Director Robert Coit, it was opportune that the Rural Development team were packaging food for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which is a USDA program that provides nutritious food ""packages"" designed specifically for the nutritional  needs of low-income pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children up to age six and elderly people 60 and older. ""It's a great program and helps us with our mission to eliminate hunger in Thurston County,"" Coit said, adding that the food bank serves 10,000 families annually, including 37,000 individuals, half of which are children, around the communities of Lacy, Olympia  and Tumwater. ""This was a great opportunity for us to help out in our local community,"" said Mario Villanueva, Washington State Director, USDA Rural Development. ""Too many Americans live in food deserts and lack access to healthy food.  USDA is a key partner in providing access to healthy food by administering the nation's nutrition programs, funding projects that provide underserved areas with greater access to fresh produce"" ""It was great!,"" said Becki Southworth, Multi-Family Housing Loan Specialist. ""I really feel like we were able to help our local community by not only what we do every day through housing, business and community programs, but by taking it up a level and getting out in the community, we were able to help meet another need, provide food to those that need it most.  I am so glad I was able to go and I would love to do it again."" ""I had fun and it felt great to know that we helped 210 families in just an hour and a half of work of great teamwork,"" said Housing Specialist Leslie Schmidt. ""It just shows how much you can help the community with just a little bit of our time."" In addition to helping out at the local food bank (an exercise the agency plans to repeat on a regular basis), Rural Development is participating in a summer food drive as part of the 2nd Annual ""Feds, Farmers, and Friends Feed Families"" (F5) initiative.  The Washington State food drive kicked off July 6 in Olympia and other area offices and will run through July 31. The food drive makes a big difference. Last summer, federal employees around the country donated more than 1 million pounds of nonperishable goods and daily essentials for those in need. The new goal for across the Federal government is 1.2 million pounds of non-perishable items. ""We know the need is great in our area and this was a chance for our agency and federal partners to contribute to a worthwhile cause,"" said Gayle Hoskison, Olympia Area Director. ""And, I agree with our staff - it was a great team effort and felt really good to help out at the food bank.  We added another 'F' to the 'F5' effort - the 6th 'F' stands for Fun!""

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Oct 31,  A wasp works its way out of an aphid mummy after developing inside as larvae. (Photo courtesy of the ARS Electron and Confocal Microscopy Unit) At Halloween, people revel in ghosts, goblins, and things that go bump in the night. Not all are in books or movies, though. There are plenty of creepy critters doing downright scary things every day in your own backyard. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, since many of these “monsters” are actually good guys getting the bad guys out of town; it’s just not always pleasant to watch. Fire ants are common in subtropical Southeastern states and have shown up as far west as California. These stinging ants are not just painful pests; they’re also a bane to agriculture, feeding on young plants and seeds, causing an estimated crop loss of $750 million per year. There are many ways to control or eliminate fire ants, but nature provides one that is tailor made for the silver screen! Enter the phorid fly, a natural predator of the fire ant. The fly swoops in on its target and deposits an egg into the ant. After hatching inside the ant, the maggot works its way into the ant’s head, where it lives for a couple of weeks, feeding on bodily fluids. The maggot then releases chemicals that eat away at the ant’s body until its head falls off. The maggot then stays in the severed head and feeds on brains until it reaches maturity and breaks out through the ant’s mouth. Like zombies? You will, if you don’t like cockroaches. The jewel wasp injects a serum into its victim, which “zombifies” the roach into submitting to its will. The passive zombie roach allows the wasp to lead it by an antenna into a nest, which quickly becomes a nursery after the wasp lays its egg. As with the phorid fly larvae, it feeds off its host until it reaches maturity. Mummies also abound in gardens and fields, courtesy of a pair of wasps. These wasps (Aphidiinae braconid wasps – pictured – and Pteromalid chaclid wasps) also deposit an egg inside the body of their prey, this time an aphid. The wasp larvae grow inside the aphid, which soon becomes mummified in that it turns inflated, rigid, and off-color. After the larva becomes an adult wasp, it chews its way out, leaving the mummy husk behind. “Husks are fun to collect and are routinely encountered in gardens,” said Matt Buffington, a research scientist with the Agricultural Research Service’s Systematic Entomology Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. “In fact, if you have them, it’s a good sign your aphid problems are being somewhat controlled.” Aphids are a scourge to crops and horticulture, where they suck on sap, which causes yellowing, stunting, distortion of plant parts, leaf mold, and, in cotton, poor fiber quality. Aphids can also transmit plant viruses. Not to be outdone, some bees (Trigona hypogea) make an appearance as scavenger vampires. “Instead of providing their young with protein from pollen, vampire bees gather protein from carcasses on the forest floor,” Buffington said. “Further, they have unique jaws for tearing into dead animal flesh and cutting it into pieces for transport and digestion.” There are plenty of other examples of insects that exemplify Halloween, but one of the spookiest is actually a mammal – the humble bat. If you can get past the vampire nature of some bats, you’ll find that many species of bats are great friends of plants; they pollinate, spread seeds, and feed on pesky bugs. So, on All Hallows’ Eve, as you’re greeting young ghosts and goblins doing their rounds of trick-or-treating, don’t forget about those beneficial creepy critters in your own backyard.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. When people think about keeping our homeland safe, they don’t usually think about animal diseases that threaten our nation’s economy and food supply, but USDA scientists do. Years of dedicated research on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is paying off. A team of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and their U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborators received the DHS Secretary's Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award at a recent ceremony in Washington, D.C. The award recognizes outstanding leadership or service distinguished by achievements of national or international significance that improves our homeland security. The team successfully developed and licensed the world’s first molecular FMD vaccine for cattle—the most significant scientific accomplishment in FMD vaccine development in the past ates. Research leading to this award was initiated by retired scientist Marvin Grubman while working at ARS’ Foreign Animal Disease Research Unit (FADRU) at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Orient Point, New York. Grubman created a novel FMD vaccine, which was used as the foundation for this work. ARS scientists receiving the award were Luis Rodriguez and Teresa de los Santos at FADRU, and Laszlo Zsak at ARS’ Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia. Other FMD team recipients were Lawrence Barrett, Jeffrey Babcock, Michelle Colby, John Neilan, Michael Santillo and Christopher Schutta, with DHS’ Science and Technology Directorate at Plum Island; and Lavanya Ratnam and Robert Webb, with the Office of General Counsel in Washington, D.C. FMD is a highly contagious disease that affects cattle, swine and other cloven-hoofed animals. Infection can lead to critical economic consequences with potential severe losses in producing and marketing meat and milk.  Although the United States has not had an FMD outbreak since , the disease is still considered a serious threat to our nation's economy and food supply. “This award is an achievement for all of us in ARS and emphasizes the importance of the work we do every day,” said Rodriguez, FADRU research leader. “Our FMD research is part of our mission, but also part of our homeland security. This was a joint interagency collaboration that turned valuable federal research into a vaccine and a product.” DHS Secretary's Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award presented to a team of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and their U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborators.

"DVM, Ph.D., USDA/APHIS Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services, U.S. Chief Veterinary Officer in  Animals  Oct 16,  Waterfowl fly at 40 to 60 miles per hour. Migrating mallards can cover 800 miles in 8 hours if helped by 50 mile per hour tail winds. We know you’ve heard it before: seasonal migratory patterns bring an increased risk of disease-carrying birds interacting with commercial or backyard poultry. But the health and safety of our U.S. poultry flock is important enough to make it worth repeating. Birds, particularly waterfowl like ducks and geese, can carry avian influenza without showing any symptoms or signs of disease. Because the risk of introduction never goes away, having strong biosecurity practices on poultry operations can help prevent the spread of infectious disease before it starts. The - U.S. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak is never far from my mind. It forced us to reevaluate our preparedness and response capabilities, from a federal, state, and industry standpoint. Today, we are all better prepared to handle and quickly respond to avian influenza detections. Our Wild Bird Surveillance Program, which has been in place for more than a decade, is on-going. Since July , USDA and our partners have collected more than 90,ates. This improves our ability to detect these viruses and helps poultry producers and others make informed management decisions. The program also gives us a chance to learn more about the virus, including the make-up and transmission of various virus strains. We’ve taken these experiences and lessons learned from the -15 outbreak and developed Defend the Flock, an outreach program that offers commercial poultry growers important information to help put the best biosecurity practices into place. Defend the Flock provides multiple resources for poultry growers, including guidance on biosecurity basics, an assessment tool to help strengthen their biosecurity programs, and sharable materials to help everyone at their operations better understand biosecurity’s importance. Stay up-to-date on the latest biosecurity information by following on Twitter. Everyone who has poultry in their care can help defend the U.S. poultry industry by reviewing the following biosecurity basics. Together, we have made great strides in our preparedness and response capabilities. Protecting American poultry remains a top USDA priority. Biosecurity can stop the disease before it stops.

"Public Information Coordinator, Mississippi Rural Development in  Rural  May 03,   U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined Obama Administration Cabinet members Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, as well as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills, and other state and local officials to tour areas in Alabama and Mississippi affected by last week’s tornadoes. After visiting devastated sites in Birmingham and nearby areas, the group crossed over to Mississippi, where they surveyed the damage done to Smithville, a town of approximately that was almost literally wiped off the map. In Smithville, Miss. the senior administration officials were joined by Mississippi’s USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George, who had made the trek from her home in central Mississippi in the pre-dawn hours on Thursday, the day after the tornado hit. State Director George viewed damaged areas in Maben, Amory, and parts of Chickasaw County on Thursday. She had monitored the tornado, keeping in contact with local officials as the tornado went through Mississippi on Wednesday. She linked up on Thursday morning with local USDA personnel in Oktibbeha County, arriving only hours after the tornado had passed through. She also toured damaged areas in Neshoba and Kemper Counties that afternoon. Secretary Tom Vilsack toured the area of Smithville, Mississippi and saw firsthand the heavy damage caused by the tornado. He is seen in this photo talking to one of the victims of the disastrous weather. Behind him is USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George of Mississippi. Secretary Vilsack and State Director George were two of a number of Obama Administration Cabinet officials, federal administrators, and local leaders to see the damage caused by tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama. “It is heartbreaking to see this damage and to talk to the people who are victims of the tornado,” said George. “I was able to not only see the physical damages, but I was able to listen to some of the actual victims, many of whom had lost everything. However, I can report that USDA Rural Development has programs that can offer some relief to these unfortunate victims.” George cited USDA Rural Development programs such as funding to replace and repair single-family homes, shared community facilities and the water and wastewater systems in the damaged areas. “I want to make sure that people know about the availability of our programs, especially our single-family home loan and home repair loan programs, so that they can rebuild their homes and businesses and continue to have clean water.” George has a history of fast action on disaster relief. Most recently, she was on the scene the day after tornadoes ran thru Holmes and Yazoo Counties in and made sure that USDA Rural Development programs were a part of both the immediate and long-term relief efforts in those counties. Local officials in both counties credited George and USDA Rural Development for their fast work in making resources available, especially to the homeowners who lost their homes in that disaster. “These people have lost everything but their spirit.

"Accelerating Economic Mobility Through Promise Zone Partnerships  In , President Obama identified the first five communities to be part of the Promise Zone initiative -- a new placed-based effort to leverage investments, increase economic activity, improve educational opportunities and improve the quality of life in some of our country’s most challenged communities. As part of the Obama Administration’s commitment to Rural America and our tribal areas, eastern Kentucky Highlands and the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma were part of the first named Promise Zone communities.  Yesterday, the Administration announced eight additional new Promise Zone communities including one rural area in the Low Country of South Carolina, and one tribal community, the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota.  Through Promise Zone effort, the Obama Administration is working across all channels and with partners to address some of the unique challenges that rural Americans face. Cecilia Muñoz, Assistant to the President and Director of the Domestic Policy Council and Luke Tate, Special Assistant to the President for Economic Mobility co-authored a blog on how Promise Zone partnerships help to increase economic mobility in the communities they serve.

"Posted by Almanza, Administrator of the Food Safety Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Oct 22,  USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service Administrator Al Almanza (fourth from left) was among the senior executives from 10 federal agencies who took part in the Interagency Import Safety Conference at Dulles, Va., on October 21, .  Yesterday I visited with FSIS personnel and 9 other federal agencies in Dulles, Virginia to focus on a critical element of food safety: protecting the public from unsafe imports. The Interagency Import Safety Conference was organized by the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to bring agencies together, improve cooperation, and build collaboration.  Our mutual goal with these efforts is ensuring the continued health and safety of the American consumer. I want to express a thanks and gratitude to those working to reach this goal to prevent foodborne contamination and protect consumers. Today marks us as one step closer to achieving our goal by focusing on food import safety cooperation. I would also like to thank our import inspection personnel who are working hard every day on the frontlines at keeping harmful imports from reaching the American public. In December of last year, the Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center opened here in Washington, D.C. to provide agencies with shared resources, analysis and expertise necessary to improving the safety of imports. This, among other initiatives proposed by the Food Safety Working Group, will provide an appropriate forum to address the concerns expressed by consumers about the safety of the food they’re serving their families. I was able to see today the commitment of our public health officials and import inspectors through innovative ideas and combined resources. I look forward to continue working across agency borders to fulfill our commitment to protecting public health.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  May 25,  Map of the dollar value of USDA Foods purchased in ; represent the states that are the largest sources of a particular type of USDA Foods. (Click to view a larger version) Do you know where your food comes from?  If you can pinpoint where your food was grown and produced, you can make more informed decisions to maximize quality, freshness, and nutritional value.  You can also help support local economies through your purchases.  The USDA Foods program takes this mantra to heart and publishes state of origin with procurement information on all USDA Foods every year.  As we like to say at FNS, “All USDA Foods are local to someone.” USDA Foods are 100 percent American grown and produced.  Each year, USDA procures more than 200 types of food, including meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, flour, cereals, and dairy products, totaling approximately $2 billion.  Organizations such as food banks, disaster and emergency feeding organizations, Indian Tribal Organizations, schools, and other feeding groups receive these USDA Foods for use in meal service or distribution to households through programs like the National School Lunch Program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. A recent report on the state of origin of USDA Foods found that USDA Foods procures food from more than three-quarters of all states.  California, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Illinois are the five states with the highest dollar amounts of USDA Foods purchases.  A number of items available through USDA Foods are sourced solely from one state.  For example, 100 percent of the strawberries purchased by USDA Foods in FY came from the state of California.  During this time, California schools received approximately 3.3 million pounds of this locally produced product through the USDA Foods program.  All of the wild blueberries came from Maine and all the catfish were purchased from Mississippi. States and schools can use this sourcing information and other purchasing trends available on our website to tailor their USDA Foods purchases accordingly, or they can simply purchase with confidence, knowing that all USDA Foods purchases help strengthen the American economy by supporting a local community somewhere across the country.

"National Forests of Florida, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 08,   Well into the wee hours of night, for five successive evenings, teams of scientists from across the southeastern United States waited and watched as bats in the Apalachicola National Forest swooped down to feed on their insect prey only to be captured in sheer mist nets. The scientific teams and U.S. Forest Service wildlife biologists were conducting bat surveys to test for white-nose syndrome and general bat healthiness throughout the region. This Seminole Bat is a medium-sized bat caught by Gary Libby, an ecologist on the Bat Blitz Team that examined bats to determine levels of health and/or disease conditions, May 22, . The Seminole Bat grows up to four and one-half inches long with a wingspan of up to 12 inches and can weigh up to one-half ounce. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby. Dubbed “Bat Blitz,” the 5-day event was hosted by the Florida Bat Working Group, which partnered with the U.S. Forest Service, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the University of Florida “We’re mapping locations where each species was captured to learn more about the types of forest and water bodies that each species is associated with here in the Panhandle,” said Assistant Professor Holly Ober of the University of Florida Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. “We'll also study the bat guano to determine which insects each bat species is feeding on.” Bat testing to date has confirmed a very low probability of local bats being affected by white-nose syndrome, a condition linked to the deaths of more than a million hibernating bats from New Hampshire to Tennessee. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the cause of the bat deaths remains unknown despite the continuing search to find the source of this condition by numerous laboratories and state and federal biologists. Each night, 12 teams of five biologists spread out across the forest and surveyed bats in places where they were expected to be feeding. “Because bats are active at night, few people see them, and even fewer understand or appreciate their importance in our daily lives,” said Micah Thorning, wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service. “For example, as the primary consumers of flying insects, bats play a crucial role in insect control.” The survey netted 246 bats of eight different species with the number of bats caught at one site totaling 57. The most widespread species caught were the Seminole Bat, Evening Bat, Red Bat and Southeastern Bat, but rarer species such as the Tricolored Bat, Big Brown Bat, Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat, and Brazilian Free-tailed Bat were also captured and tested. The event started in with the Southeastern Bat Diversity Network (SBDN) selecting Tennessee to host the first Bat Blitz. SBDN promotes, facilitates and organizes the event every year. The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is one of two of its kind caught on found on the Apalachicola National Forest during Bat Blitz, May 22, . The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is listed as a sensitive species and is a rare find on the National Forests of Florida. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby. “Planning a Bat Blitz takes a lot of time and effort -- most states begin planning one and a half to two years in advance,” said Ober. “We began a bit late, so we have been working feverishly for the past eight months.” Ober credited their success to the dedication of a core group of individuals from the Florida Bat Working Group, an organization of local, state and federal agencies and private partners.

"Director, SNAP Benefit Redemption Division in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 29,   Last summer, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), in collaboration with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), released  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook.  The handbook assists farmers’ market operators and direct marketing farmers in determining the steps necessary to become authorized to participate in SNAP and, subsequently, the steps related to managing participation. It includes tips and on how to make the program work successfully for vendors and customers.  The handbook also features a list of resources, a glossary of important terms, and several case studies from farmers markets that have successfully implemented EBT technology.  AMS’s USDA Farmers’ Market Directory is available online to locate farmers’ markets that accept nutrition assistance program benefits. Collaboration through the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative led the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS),to co-release, with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook."" There are many benefits to making farmers’ markets more accessible to all communities, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet in these hard times.  The concentration of fresh and nutritious foods found at farmers’ markets and sold by direct marketing farmers helps introduce low-income households to a variety of healthy options.  As SNAP clients increase their demand for local produce, small farmers have potential to increase in their customer base.  Our goal here at FNS is to authorize an additional 200 direct marketing farmers and/or farmers’ markets to accept SNAP benefits and increase redemptions nationally by at least $750,000 each year.  We are on our way to reaching these goals.  At the end of Federal Fiscal Year () , according to AMS, a total of 6,132 farmers’ markets were operating around the United States.  This represents a 16 percent rise from .  Of this total, 1,611 farmers’ markets and direct marketing farmers were authorized by FNS and redeemed $7,547,028 in SNAP benefits.  This is a 263 percent increase in the number of authorized farmers and farmers’ markets and a 49 percent increase in SNAP redemptions over the previous five fiscal years. Under regular SNAP rules, EBT equipment is provided free of charge and the expense is shared by the SNAP state agency and FNS.  For farmers’ markets and direct marketing farmers that do not have access to a land line and electricity necessary for the standard equipment to work,  the markets may elect to use manual paper vouchers or purchase wireless equipment through a third party processor.  FNS reimburses states that wish to provide wireless equipment to farmers and markets at the rate of 50 percent of the cost of equipment as part of the administrative cost associated with benefit issuance.  Under a demonstration waiver, FNS allows markets to implement scrip projects that allow a farmers’ market to obtain one FNS authorization to accept SNAP benefits for all eligible vendors at the market by using a single point-of-sale (POS) terminal.  The scrip (paper, tokens or receipts) is purchased at a centrally-located POS terminal that accepts SNAP benefits and is exchanged for eligible food products by participating vendors.  Many markets also use this process for accepting credit and debit cards. FNS has conducted a congressionally-mandated cost benefit analysis to assess the feasibility of equipping all farmers’ markets nationwide with wireless EBT point-of-sale (POS) equipment.  This analysis focuses on requiring centralized operation of a single EBT terminal to issue scrip, as it is the most cost effective way to equip farmers markets and often the most practical way for markets to manage participation.  It is likely that most farmers’ markets will implement SNAP if funding is made available.   President Obama has included a request for $4 million in the budget to support this effort.

"Posted by Written by Katie Yocum, USDA Rural Development in  Initiatives  USDA Results  Technology  Jun 11,  While the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is rich in cultural pride, identity and history, its remote location in the rugged terrain of Southeast Oklahoma has severely limited the tribe’s economic development efforts.  But a Broadband Initiative Program grant, made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will enable Pine Telephone Company (PTC) to use innovative wireless technology to deliver affordable broadband service to portions of this rural, remote and economically disadvantaged region in Southeast Oklahoma. During World War II, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma provided an invaluable service to the United States by pioneering the use of Code Talking, using the native Choctaw language, to prevent enemy forces from intercepting the transmission of army secrets. And in , the Choctaw Nation was awarded the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition of support of employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.  So while the Choctaw Nation has shown outstanding compassion for the nation and its tribal members, the local economies of Choctaw communities have suffered tremendously.  Of the five counties on tribal lands that will be served by PTC, all of them are plagued with unemployment rates that soar above the state average and a substantial proportion of residents living below the poverty line. PTC spent years testing broadband technologies that would offer reliable internet service to residents of this remote region, and they determined that advanced 3G technology presents the most viable solution. The system is designed to be scalable and to cost-effectively accommodate technology upgrades, so that it will remain viable for years to come. PTC’s system will offer service to nearly 5,000 households, 10 school districts, and 12 volunteer fire departments and ambulance services. With reliable, high speed wireless access, the region will be able to overcome their geographic isolation to stimulate the sustainable economic growth that it needs.  And offering quality internet access to key community institutions, like schools and public safety bodies, will mean better educational opportunities and enhanced health care and public safety for residents of this region. And in addition to the many benefits to be reaped by members of the Choctaw Nation, this Recovery Act project will also create more than 150 jobs over the multi-year construction period.

Photo courtesy Ron Ploof Sometimes it can take a while to turn a good idea into a successful venture.  At USDA, we understand the value of research, and by providing resources to get things started at the local level, we often see amazing results that have positive impact for farmers, agribusinesses and consumers across the country. The Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program (FSMIP), administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, is one of the many ways that USDA makes an investment in the future of agriculture.  Funding practical research projects that focus on innovation and collaboration, FSMIP’s diverse projects reflect the unique marketing challenges and opportunities faced by different agribusiness sectors, local communities and regions.  Sometimes, by solving a specific problem within their state or local area, grant recipients end up addressing issues that have national or industry-wide impact. With the support of FSMIP funds in and , the California Association of Food Banks (CAFB), in partnership with the California Department of Food and Agriculture, was able to dramatically expand its Farm to Family program.  Among several positive outcomes was a pilot project to help food banks access nutrient-dense row crops. Crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and celery are often sorted and separated right in the harvest field.  Products that do not meet supermarket grade are usually left in the field and tilled under.  CAFB worked with two major growers to harvest cull products, providing a steady source of high nutrient vegetables to food banks.  Since the project’s inception, people in need have enjoyed over 8 million pounds of these crops, and food banks now have a regular, permanent supply of nutrient-dense row crops.  This project provides a model for other states seeking to provide a new market for produce growers while meeting a vital food need.

Photo courtesy Alameda County Community Food Bank With FSMIP funding, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team led by Ohio State University used surveys and case studies to evaluate the current marketing strategies and practices of Ohio food producers.  The goal was to determine if and how a web-based marketing system called MarketMaker improved the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.  MarketMaker is currently one of the most extensive collections of searchable food industry related in the country and contains over 400,000 profiles of farmers and other food related enterprises in 19 states and the District of Columbia. This investment continues to benefit Ohio food producers in numerous ways.  The FSMIP study was the first step in developing standardized protocols to evaluate the contribution of marketing tools on reducing transaction costs and leveling the playing field for local food enterprises on a national level. As a result, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team attracted additional funding to develop training modules such as MarketReady to prepare producers to enter new markets.  They also held “Meet the Buyers” forums to bring buyers and sellers together for targeted sales meetings, and developed maps, apps & mobile media marketing tools to help consumers find producers. In , the number of registered producers and users of Ohio MarketMaker increased significantly.  There were more than 5,000 visitors and 679 registered producers by the end of the year.  In , Ohio was one of two states recognized with the first National Food MarketMaker Innovation Awards, sponsored by Farm Credit.  Building on strong food industry partnerships, the “Get Connected” campaign engaged new organizations through customized promotional and educational materials. As a result, the number of registered MarketMaker users nearly doubled from to . The creation of “Get Connected” artwork and marketing resources will benefit the entire national MarketMaker network of states. There are many other tales of innovative and collaborative FSMIP projects, and this year’s projects are no different.  More than half of the 22 projects focus on increasing sales of meat products, aquaculture products, and fresh and processed produce in local and regional food systems. Other research topics include forestry, bioenergy and horticulture. I’m sure that over the next few years—as these great ideas continue to build and have a positive impact on American agriculture—we’ll have even more success stories to share.

"Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative Coordinator, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 03,  Lesser prairie-chickens benefit from lands where a rancher is using prescribed grazing, according to a new report. Photo courtesy of Nick Richter. Habitat conservation practices make a difference for lesser prairie-chickens. That's the finding of a recent scientific study – the first part of a multi-year study – described in a new report from the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative (LPCI). LPCI, led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), works with partner organizations and ranchers to improve habitat and address threats to the bird. Since , more than 1 million acres of habitat have been restored on working lands. NRCS works with partners to monitor the outcomes, which helps determine if conservation practices are making a difference, but accurately estimating wildlife populations can be challenging with uncommon, widely dispersed species like the lesser prairie-chicken. A recent study identified a new model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, and it shows encouraging evidence that NRCS-recommended conservation practices through LPCI are working and that large blocks of intact prairie are important to prairie-chicken conservation. The study assessed one year of from the annual aerial survey of lesser prairie-chicken lek sites conducted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and it looked at four factors that might impact site occupancy — patch size of native vegetation, percent of land cover managed with prescribed grazing; percent of land cover enrolled in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and density of primary roads. The research team intends to continue with a multi-year study that assesses additional variables. As the amount of land enrolled in CRP or using prescribed grazing increases, the likelihood that lesser prairie-chickens will occupy that land also increases. Lesser prairie-chickens face many threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation from row-crop agriculture, fire suppression, unmanaged grazing, development, and drought. The species currently occupies just 16 percent of its historic range. But in western Kansas, lesser prairie-chickens have reoccupied portions of their historical range and have even moved into areas outside that historical range. The range expansion coincides with former croplands enrolled and maintained as grasslands through CRP as well as native grasslands managed using LPCI prescribed grazing practices. A team of researchers tested whether there was a quantifiable link between land where ranchers are implementing LPCI prescribed grazing plans or have enrolled their land in CRP and the likelihood of prairie-chickens occupying a landscape. Their results indicate that these habitat conservation efforts are working. After developing an expanded model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, the team found that occupancy increases as prairie patch-size increases, as well as in landscapes with ongoing conservation practices. Specifically, the results indicate that when ranchers are using prescribed grazing or enrolling land in CRP, the likelihood of lesser prairie-chickens occupying that habitat increases significantly. The report’s management recommendations include: Enrolling acreage within the lesser prairie-chicken active range in prescribed grazing or CRP. Maintaining large blocks of native prairie across the range through sustainable ranching. Identifying potential landscapes with willing landowners to develop conservation easements, particularly if combined with prescribed grazing and other proven habitat conservation practices. Implementing prescribed grazing on dispersed patches throughout large blocks of rangeland. Cultivating diverse stands of CRP-enrolled grasslands that serve as connective tissue to larger patches of native prairie. Retaining CRP acreage as grasslands after contract expiration. NRCS outlined its three-year conservation strategy for lesser prairie-chicken conservation, which encourages adoption of many of the above recommendations on 500,000 additional acres, such as prescribed grazing, using easements to protect key habitat corridors, and providing assistance to convert expiring CRP lands to grazing.

"New Study Offers Sage Advice  For many, one of the New Year’s first big chores is to remove a tree from inside their home. Trees, beautiful and useful as they are, do not belong everywhere. Such is the case with trees and other woody species that are expanding into the Western grasslands. Over the years, woody species like juniper, pinyon pine, redcedar and mesquite have encroached on grassland and sagebrush ecosystems, altering these landscapes and making them unsuitable for native wildlife like the lesser prairie-chicken and greater sage-grouse. Encroaching conifers also degrade rangelands for agricultural producers whose livestock rely on nutritious forage.  Spencer Miller, Natural Resources Conservation Service  Posted in  Conservation  Jan 18,   3 Responses",What is the impact of encroaching conifers and mesquite trees on Western grasslands?,"The impact of encroaching conifers (such as juniper, pinyon pine, and redcedar) and mesquite trees on Western grasslands is that they alter these landscapes, making them unsuitable for native wildlife and degrading rangelands for agricultural producers."
"Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Sep 22,  Utah rancher Bill Kennedy worked with NRCS through SGI to improve his working rangelands for sage grouse and livestock. Photo by Jesse Bussard. This past April, we woke up at 3 a.m. and made our way to a blind amid an expanse of sagebrush on a ranch in central Montana. When the sun rose that morning, I saw my first sage grouse--actually, I got to see more than 100 of them!--when the birds arrived at the lek site for their famous tail-shaking springtime courtship dance. Seeing sage grouse in action reminded me how important it is to do what we do here at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). I saw firsthand how agriculture and wildlife can co-exist and thrive. In the West, we work with over 1,300 ranchers through the NRCS-led Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI) to improve their ranching operations while also helping this iconic bird. It’s been a big year for sage grouse. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) determined last year that the species didn’t merit protections under the Endangered Species Act because of the collaborative conservation efforts underway to help the species. Central to that effort were ranchers, who have stepped forward for many years to make a difference. But last year’s decision did not mean we slowed down our conservation work through SGI. We’re here for the long haul, building on previous successes by implementing our Sage Grouse Initiative 2.rategy, which will conserve an estimated 8 million acres of sagebrush—along with 350+ species that depend on it--by . Sage grouse are an “umbrella species” and an icon of the Western range. When ranchers implement conservation practices that benefit sage grouse, those practices also benefit 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman. With the help of conservation partners, NRCS has conserved 5 million acres of sagebrush rangeland and reduced threats to sage grouse. In the past six years, SGI and ranchers have: Reduced the threat of invasive grasses and wildfire by managing for healthier rangelands on 1.8 million acres. Removed 457,000 acres of expanding conifer to reclaim core sage grouse habitat. Protected 451,000 acres of agricultural land and prime wildlife habitat for 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Improved grazing strategies to enhance range habitat on more than 2.7 million acres for sage grouse and other wildlife species. Conserved 12,000 acres and improved 179 acres of wet meadow and riparian areas for brooding hens. Marked or moved 628 miles of high-risk fences to reduce sage grouse collisions by 83 percent. We continue to fine-tune our conservation efforts through science and research. In the past year, we’ve documented how removing encroaching juniper to restore sagebrush benefits songbirds as well as sage grouse. We’ve also studied how and where to reduce the risk of converting sagebrush into cultivated cropland, which we made available on the new SGI Interactive Web Application. This new online mapping tool provides free on rangewide conditions, helping NRCS conservationists and partners plan and prioritize conservation projects. Plus, we now use our successful efforts in sagebrush country as a model for the rest of the country. We are applying what we’ve learned to other priority species and landscapes to replicate success through Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW). The future of wildlife, agriculture and rural ways of life depend on this shining model of collaborative conservation. SGI uses science, research and tools to improve and fine-tune conservation efforts. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman.  If there’s one thing we’ve learned, it's that, together, we can make a difference. We’re proud of our collective past achievements and look forward to continuing our work with America’s producers to conserve landscapes for future generations.

"Branch Chief, Farmers Market and Direct Market Research Branch, AMS in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Dec 17,  Shed Two at Detroit’s Eastern Market Look up Wayne County, Michigan, home to Detroit, in USDA’s Food Environment Atlas and it is obvious that local residents have some significant challenges in accessing healthful food.  An alarmingly high number of households that lack a car in Wayne County are located further than one mile from the closest grocery store, meaning that many families struggle to get access to fresh and healthy food.   Indeed, the closure of two supermarkets in left Detroit as the largest city in the country without a single full-service supermarket within its boundaries. A recent study indicates that over half a million of Detroit’s residents live in neighborhoods where they must travel twice as far to reach a grocery store than they do to reach a convenience store. As a result, many families are forced to buy their meals at these convenience stores, where microwavable pre-prepared meals and fast food are well-stocked, and fresh and healthy foods are often hard to find. Detroit, in other words, is a food desert. But, there is good news! Eastern Market Corporation, one of the nation’s longest operating public markets has taken on the challenge of addressing Detroit’s significant food access issues. Eastern Market has developed a comprehensive “food hub,”  coordinating aggregation and distribution for many of Michigan’s small and mid-size farmers who are producing the healthy food that Motor City residents need and want.  With nearly 500,000 of Wayne County’s 1.9 million residents relying on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) for their food purchases, the market director knew that it was important to ensure that his organization could process SNAP benefits. Today, Eastern Market processes up to $30,000 of SNAP transactions per month.  What’s more, SNAP benefits redeemed at Eastern Market are doubled for each participating household with the support of the Fair Food Network, an organization that provides a financial match to SNAP redemptions through its Double Up Food Bucks program. As part of the USDA’s interest in examining  how actively coordinated food hubs can play an important role in eradicating food deserts, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service has partnered with Eastern Market through a cooperative research agreement to expand the availability of fresh, healthful  and locally-produced food throughout Detroit.  Our to-do list includes: Developing more direct-to-consumer marketing activities in neighborhoods challenged by poor public transportation systems; Training farm vendors  about emerging opportunities for direct-to-consumer sales in food desert neighborhoods; Facilitating deliveries between the region’s local growers and organizations who are dedicated to distributing fresh, healthful food directly to Detroit’s neighborhoods in need; and, Educating local residents about available nutrition assistance programs and emerging market outlets. As a food hub, Eastern Market is uniquely positioned to serve all people in Detroit while economic benefits to local farmers, ranchers, and dairies.  Eastern Market and its member tenants provide a bevy of wholesale services that open new markets for the region’s small and midsize producers—including aggregation, distribution, processing and commercial market opportunities.  Eastern Market also houses prepared food businesses (like ravioli and fresh salsa).  They’re even planning to redevelop a full square mile in a dedicated economic development district to bring in additional business incubators, restaurants, retailers, wholesale services and a distribution center – all designed to help rebuild southeast Michigan’s regional food system and eliminate Detroit’s food access problems. By integrating all of these diverse business functions into one centralized, coordinated regional “food hub,” Eastern Market’s business development model can be expected to bring good things to Detroit.

"Got Weeds? Need to hold water in the soil? Mulch can help with these things and more. Mulching is one of the simplest and most beneficial practices you can use in the garden. Mulch is simply a protective layer of a material that is spread on top of the soil. Mulches can either be organic -- such as grass clippings, straw, bark chips, and similar materials -- or inorganic -- such as stones, brick chips, and plastic. Both organic and inorganic mulches have numerous benefits. Mulch helps conserve and extend available water, protects the soil from erosion, reduces competition by suppressing weeds, moderates temperature extremes, and acts as a barrier or visible marker of gardening beds to limit damage by landscape maintenance equipment. Understanding when, what type and how much mulch to spread is important because spreading too much mulch can be damaging to trees and plants.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .13  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, June 10, – Today, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack kicked off National Summer Food Service Program Week by reiterating USDA's commitment to ensuring that no child goes hungry when school is out and highlighting progress towards USDA's goal of serving 5 million more meals to eligible kids across the country.""When school is out during the summer months, many families struggle to feed their children even one nutritious meal a day,"" said Vilsack. ""Government cannot address this challenge alone, which is why, this week, we join our valued partners to raise awareness about the nutrition gap low-income children face when schools close for the summer. Working together, we can make sure children have access to nutritious food year-round.""National Summer Food Service Program week is a national push to promote USDA's Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) and other initiatives across the country to feed more low-income children when school is out. These federally-funded programs are designed to alleviate hunger during the summer months and operate through partnerships between USDA, state agencies and local organizations.Last year, USDA's summer feeding programs provided 161 million meals, feeding approximately 3.5 million children on a typical summer day. In order to ensure that no child goes hungry this summer, USDA and its partners are redoubling their efforts to reach more eligible low-income children. USDA efforts include:""USDA's summer feeding initiative supports programs that keep children active and engaged when school is out, reducing learning loss that often occurs during the summer months,"" said Vilsack. ""We must do all we can to ensure that children get nutritious food year-round, so that they are ready to learn during the school year and have a greater chance to succeed.""USDA continues working with First Lady Michelle Obama on the Let's Move! initiative, which is helping to promote healthy eating and physical activity while supporting the health of American families. Through the combined efforts of USDA and its partners, the United States is beginning to see progress and improvements in the health of our Nation's children.USDA's Food and Nutrition Service oversees the administration of 15 nutrition assistance programs, including the Summer Food Service Program and other child nutrition programs, that touch the lives of one in four Americans over the course of a year. These programs work in concert to form a national safety net against hunger. Visit www.fns.usda.gov for information about FNS and nutrition assistance programs.USDA has made a concerted effort to deliver results for the American people, even as USDA implements sequestration – the across-the-board budget reductions mandated under terms of the Budget Control Act.

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance. Fall is widely considered the best time of year to plant native trees, shrubs, grasses, vines and perennials.

"In the United States, between 30-40 percent of food is wasted. This means that food that could have helped feed families in need is sent to landfills. Urban gardens can play a role in creating rich compost and improved soil quality from food waste. The best thing, however, is to reduce the food you waste in the first place. Learn how USDA is fighting food waste and how you can too. Food Donation All food grown in a People’s Garden at a USDA-owned, or leased, facility is donated to local food pantries, food banks, food rescue programs, kitchens, and shelters. Those growing food at other locations are encouraged to donate a portion of what’s grown to help those in need and reduce food waste. If you grow more than you need, donate it, don’t waste it! Helpful Tip Donations of food and grocery items to non-profits to feed needy individuals are covered by the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act (Public Law 104-210). Unless there is gross negligence or misconduct on behalf of the donor, individuals and groups are not liable. Visit the USDA Food Loss and Waste webpage to find resources for farmers, businesses, consumers, schools and more! Sign-up for email updates and view past webinars, including “USDA Programs, Investments, and Innovations to Prevent and Reduce Food Loss and Waste”.

Reduce food waste in the first place. 2. Compost food waste at urban gardens to create rich compost and improved soil quality. 3. Donate excess food grown in a People's Garden or elsewhere to local food pantries, banks, rescue programs, kitchens, and shelters. Additionally, the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act (Public Law 104-210) provides protection for individuals and groups who donate food to non-profits, making it easier to donate without fear of liability."
"What is composting? Composting is the process of recycling organic materials into an amendment that can be used to enrich soil and plants. Types of Compost Bins Typical Compost Bin Tumbler Compost Bin Worm Compost Bin Why Compost? Food scraps and yard waste currently make up 20 to 30 percent of what we throw away. USDA is fighting food waste and you can too. Composting is nature’s way of recycling! Here are a few reasons to get started today:  Feed the soil without using chemical fertilizers.  Keep food waste out of the landfills and prevent greenhouse gas emissions.  Conserve water by building healthy soils. Get Started There are different ways to get started composting today. You can start a backyard composting bin or use worms to do the work. Backyard composting in three easy steps:  Choose a location. A good site is dry in either the sun or partial shade.  Set-up your compost bin. Purchase a compost bin or create an inexpensive bin with wire mesh and 3-4 poles for support.  Get composting. Include 2-3 parts “brown material” (fall leaves, twigs, shredded newspaper, straw, wood chips, and shredded wood) and 1 part “green material” (vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, crushed eggshells, garden and grass clippings, tea bags without staples) by volume then add water to keep moist. Don’t forget to turn your pile! A monthly rotation is a good rule of thumb. Worm Composting Setup:  Select Container. Purchase a worm bin or make your own from a plastic or wood storage container. Worm bins require holes drilled for aeration and drainage. There are several online sources with instructions to create a worm bin.  Locate bin. The ideal temperature for worm composting is 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate the worm bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.  Worm Bin Setup:  Worms need bedding such as a mixture of non-glossy paper, cardboard, or leaves. Soak the material for 10 minutes, wring out the water so it is moist but not saturated, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.  Now you are ready to add your worms. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only 7 are suitable for vermicomposting. The most widely used species is the “red wiggler” which you can buy from a worm grower. Do not use worms from a bait shop or your garden since they will not be able to thrive in your worm bin.  Feed your worms veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and moistened bread. Avoid meat, fish, dairy products, citrus fruits, twigs and branches.

Considering these differences, both methods are suitable for reducing food waste. However, vermicomposting is more ideal for homeowners who: * Have limited outdoor space * Want to reduce odors and pests associated with traditional composting * Can maintain a consistent temperature in their worm bin * Are willing to invest time and effort in managing the worms and their diet For homeowners looking to reduce food waste, either method can be effective. However, if you're short on outdoor space or prefer a more hands-off approach, vermicomposting might be the better choice."
"Southwest Regional Assistant WIC Director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 21,  Claudia Crow, a farmer from Shawnee, OK, assists a customer during the Pottowatomie County Famers Market Five-Year Anniversary.  In the hustle and bustle of working for the WIC program in the Southwest Region, I travel quite often, attending meetings and ensuring logistics much like many of my fellow federal and state co-workers. Recently I had the privilege to attend the Pottawatomie County Farmers Market five-year anniversary in Shawnee, OK. Having grown up in a very rural town, representing FNS was a learning experience that reminded me of home. The event was a total success, as the market was full of people including farmers, seniors, families and children. Celebrating five years of service, the event included live music, family and children’s activities, and most important of all: fresh fruit and vegetables. I learned that famers drive hours to sell their crops at the market, and it accounts for as much as over two-thirds of their income. Most farmers market customers swear by the produce bought there, as it is much fresher and lasts longer than normal store-bought produce. In some cases, supermarket produce makes a week-long journey of over 1,500 miles before getting into the kitchen. But the most important part was seeing FNS programs like WIC and SNAP EBT represented. All of the farmers were knowledgeable about Farm to School and Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, and have even started farm tours for children and have working relationships with local schools. Getting fresh vegetables in school cafeterias straight from the farm is great on so many levels! Observing our partnerships at the grassroots stage from farmer to a customer, or farmer to a school sets a tone for the whole region. The relationships I see built are ones that last for years, and I wish the Farmers Market all the best in their future endeavors. Here’s to another five years of successful farming and selling!

"Cover Crops Cover crops are traditionally planted on farms but can be used in gardens. A cover crop is any crop grown to cover the soil and may be incorporated into the soil later for enrichment. Planting cover crops in your garden provides multiple benefits such as controlling erosion, suppressing weeds, reducing soil compaction, increasing moisture and nutrient content of soil, improving yield potential, attracting pollinators, and providing habitat for beneficial insects and wildlife as well as food to animals. Cover crops (grasses, legumes and forbs) recommended for seasonal cover and other conservation purposes include annual ryegrass, oilseed radish, winter cereal rye, and oats used for scavenging unused fertilizer and releasing nutrients back into the soil for the next crop to use. Good cover crops to break up compacted soils are forage radish (also known as oilseed radish) and forage turnip. Similar to commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizers, legume cover crops like crimson clover, hairy vetch and Austrian winter pea can help “grow” some of your N needs. Crop Rotation It has long been a common practice for farmers to vary the crops grown in each field from year to year. This same practice of rotating crops can be applied to small-scale food gardens. Make a plan to grow certain plant families in one area of the garden this season and in a different area next season. For crop rotation to be most effective, don’t plant an area with vegetables from the same plant family more than once every three to four years. Rotating crops can have important production benefits such as increasing yields, improving nutrients and organic matter in the soil, and it can help disrupt the lifecycle of crop pests, reducing chemical use. Don’t forget to add a cover crop to your rotation –especially when the garden is fallow –to reduce soil erosion and improve wildlife habitat.

"Posted by the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library in  Health and Safety  USDA Results  Jul 29,  USDA’s National Agricultural Library launches its latest Web exhibit “How Did We Can?” on home canning in the United States. July is the height of summer grilling season, and throughout the month USDA is highlighting changes made to the U.S. food safety system over the course of this Administration. For an interactive look at USDA’s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence. The USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) recently launched its newest online exhibit, “How Did We Can? —The Evolution of Home Canning Practices.” The exhibit follows the evolution of home canning in the United States and the progression of associated food safety . Canning aids in food preservation by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination. Home canning held an important role in 20th century food preservation, particularly through the two World Wars, and continues to be practiced today. “How Did We Can?” highlights changes in home canning based on a growing understanding of bacteriology. Around the turn of the 20th century, the four most prominent canning techniques were oven, open-kettle, water bath, and pressure canning. By the end of World War II, the USDA recommended only two techniques: water bath for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods. Those recommendations remain the same under the current USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning. During World War I and World War II, canning was touted as being imperative to the war effort on the home front and was referred to as “a real war job” in a Office of War Information poster. Home canning peaked during World War II when over four billion cans were processed in . While home canning has never since reached such a height, it continues to thrive today among home food preservation enthusiasts.

"High-Tech Agriculture Continues to Reap Rewards for Farmers and Society  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Just like a smart phone helps users learn, communicate and make important decisions, smart technology—known as precision agriculture—helps farmers know and apply critical information about the right investments in fertilizer, seed, pesticide and water needed to produce their crops. Through new technologies, farmers produce more efficiently and see an increase in profits while improving stewardship of ecosystems and local communities. To talk about precision agriculture is to talk about mapping the amount of a crop grown per acre (yield) or the types of soils in a given area. It also includes the technology that automatically guides farm machines and controls variables like the rates of seeds, fertilizers or chemicals.

"Posted by the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library in  Initiatives  Health and Safety  Nov 21,  USDA Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) microbiologist Monifa Peterson demonstrates the addition of reagents for an E. coli non-O157:H7 analysis. Food is necessary and can be quite enjoyable, but it must also be safe to eat. Unfortunately, about one out of six Americans gets sick from eating contaminated food at some point during the year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists from USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) work for one of the federal agencies that conducts research to help make the foods we eat safer. To help the public more easily access USDA food safety research information, the department’s National Agricultural Library’s Food Safety Research Information Office (FSRIO) has launched a new “Meet the Experts” online video collection available on the NAL website. FSRIO has collected videos from a variety of sources and organized them in one repository. Current videos highlight ARS food safety research. FSRIO will add other videos to the collection that highlights research and food safety efforts from across USDA agencies. Many foods must travel through different points between the farm and your plate.  Lettuce, for example, is harvested from the field, cooled, processed and packaged, then transported to your grocery store where it is displayed in a cooler waiting for someone to buy it, transport it home or to a restaurant where it finally gets prepared and eaten.  ARS scientists in the produce-safety videos discuss how their research is improving the safety of that lettuce all through its journey to the grocery display cooler.  Stay tuned as additional videos are added to the “Meet the Experts” website.

"US Forest Service Mobilizes to Save Cavity Birds  Small owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards. They prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death.

"AMS Administrator in  Research and Science  May 16,  Pictured here with his pet rooster, March, Lue Gim Gong’s work with citrus trees helped develop a frost-tolerant orange after a disastrous winter in Florida. No one should live in this world for himself alone, but to do good for those who come after him. These are the words that Lue Gim Gong lived by.  When he was only 12 years old, Lue left his home and farmer parents in Canton, China and crossed the Pacific Ocean to America.  He lived and worked in San Francisco until he was 16, and then moved to Massachusetts to take a job at the C.T. Sampson shoe factory. At church, Lue met Fannie Burlingame, the daughter of a wealthy farmer and merchant.  She immediately recognized his desire to learn and his natural talent with plants.   He eventually came to live with her family and they helped him become an American citizen in . Along with his green thumb, Lue had a knack for storytelling and a way with animals.  While his personality and desire to learn were larger than life, his body was frail and at some point in his youth he became very ill, possibly with tuberculosis.  His condition was made worse by the cold New England climate, so Fannie suggested he move to DeLand, Florida, where she and her sister owned a house and orchard. Working with William Dumville, Fannie’s brother-in-law, Lue planted orange trees and other fruits, immersing himself in the world of horticulture. In the winter of -95, Florida saw some of the worst freezes in recorded history.  Almost all of the citrus groves were lost—including the ones worked by Lue and Dumville.  Lue’s experiments in cross-pollination became focused on producing fruits that were more tolerant of cold weather. Fannie passed away in , leaving Lue the house and property in DeLand.  Devastated by the loss of “Mother Fannie,” Lue became a bit of an eccentric fixture in the small Florida community.  His pet rooster, March, and two horses named Baby and Fannie were his main companions, but his work with plant varieties continued. In , he was recognized for successfully cross-pollinated a “Hart’s Late” Valencia orange with a “Mediterranean Sweet” to produce a new orange named the “Lue Gim Gong.”  This sweet new variation, later found to be a nucellar seedling of the Valencia, ripened in the early fall and was much more resistant to the cold.  It is sold under the Valencia name today. His achievement won the Silver Wilder Medal, awarded by the American Pomological Society—the first such award for a citrus fruit. Lue also developed an apple that ripened a month earlier than other varieties, tomatoes that grew in clusters, and a peach that would ripen in late November.  His continued efforts with citrus plants also produced varieties of grapefruits that grew singularly (instead of in clumps), a cold-tolerant grapefruit that was slower to drop and a “perfumed” variety that had a heavy fragrance. Lue’s conviction to do lasting good changed the Florida citrus industry and broadened the seasonal range for many orchard-grown trees.  While his life was lived simply and mostly outside of the limelight, he certainly did his best to create something good for the generations of farmers that came after him. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), celebrates the life of Lue Gim Gong and spirit of the words he lived by.  From our programs that support farmers and ranchers of all sizes to our role in bringing food to U.S. troops, we strive to do good for those around us and those who will come after us.

"Be Fire Wise: Preparing Your Home for Wildfire Season  Very often, the difference between saving your home in a wild fire and losing it to the flames is pretty much determined by what you do to prepare your property. The U.S. Forest Service calls it being Fire Wise. I’ve had personal experience in the importance of clearing a wide perimeter around your property to deny fuel—dried wood, grass and trees—to a fire. Back about ten years ago my grandparents’ ranch house near the Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County was spared because of a 150-foot clear space between the flames and the house. And this wasn’t the first time that had happened.

The USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) recently launched its newest online exhibit, “How Did We Can? —The Evolution of Home Canning Practices.” The exhibit follows the evolution of home canning in the United States and the progression of associated food safety . Canning aids in food preservation by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination. Home canning held an important role in 20th century food preservation, particularly through the two World Wars, and continues to be practiced today. “How Did We Can?” highlights changes in home canning based on a growing understanding of bacteriology. Around the turn of the 20th century, the four most prominent canning techniques were oven, open-kettle, water bath, and pressure canning. By the end of World War II, the USDA recommended only two techniques: water bath for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods. Those recommendations remain the same under the current USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning.  the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library  Posted in  Health and Safety  USDA Results  Jul 29,   1 Response","What is the primary method through which canning aids in food preservation, as described in the ""How Did We Can?"" online exhibit?",The primary method through which canning aids in food preservation is by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination.

"Public Affairs Specialist, APHIS in  Animals  Plants  Apr 16,  Delicious citrus: Scott Bauer, USDA Agricultural Research Service It’s time to grab those gloves and get outside for some gardening!  April is not only a great time to plant citrus trees, but it’s also Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Before wielding that shovel, take a few minutes to learn how to keep your trees healthy and prevent the spread of citrus disease. Citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), is one of the most severe plant diseases in the world. The disease has devastated millions of citrus trees in the United States and now has the potential to eliminate the citrus industry.  Once a tree is infected with the disease, there is no known cure. Citrus greening is spread by a bug the size of the head of a pin—the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP). When the bug feeds on an infected tree, it becomes a carrier, spreading the disease from one tree to another.  Although the disease is not harmful to humans, fruit from infected trees are not suitable for consumption because of their green color, misshapen appearance and bitter taste. Here are four tips to help get you started with citrus while preventing the spread of citrus greening disease: 1. Be Aware of Quarantines. If you are thinking about buying a citrus plant, be sure not to move it from quarantined states or territories. Not only are you risking spreading citrus diseases by transporting citrus outside of these areas, but it's also against the law. Review the quarantine map at SaveOurCitrus.org. 2. Check the Citrus Plant Supplier. Be a savvy buyer. Citrus plants sold in a regulated state must be sold from a certified vendor and be properly labeled.  3. Keep Homegrown Citrus at Home. Help reduce the spread of citrus diseases by not moving your homegrown citrus fruit or plants from quarantine areas. 4. Inspect Citrus Plants Regularly for Diseases and Insects. Visit our symptom checklist and corresponding photos to identify a plant impacted by ACP, citrus greening, citrus canker, citrus black spot and sweet orange scab. If you detect an infected plant, report it immediately. If you suspect your citrus may be diseased, report it immediately to the USDA.  The USDA’s Save Our Citrus iPhone App offers a convenient way for people to identify and report suspected citrus disease. This free app is available for download from the iTunes store.   To learn more about the Save Our Citrus program, visit www.saveourcitrus.org or follow the program on Facebook and Twitter. USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has declared April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Throughout the month, APHIS is posting a series of blog entries here and also share invasive plant pest and disease information through our twitter feed. APHIS and its federal and state partners are fighting to protect our communities, our public lands, and our agricultural resources from invasive species. But we can’t do it alone.

"Shoshone National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 19,  Prince Albert II of Monaco poses in between Wapiti District Ranger Sue Stresser and Shoshone Forest Supervisor Joe Alexander. (U.S. Forest Service/ Kristie Salzmann) On a beautiful fall day on America’s first national forest, Prince Albert II of Monaco retraced the steps his great-grandfather took 100 years ago through the wilderness of the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming. Prince Albert II helped celebrate on Sept. 20 the centennial anniversary of the hunting trip his great-grandfather, Prince Albert I, took with now-historic figures William “Buffalo Bill” Cody and Abraham Archibald Anderson, the first Special Superintendent of Forest Reserves. The successful hunting trip cemented lasting relationships between the men and established an area in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, which is still known today as Camp Monaco. The centennial celebration began with a morning horseback trail ride following a route very similar to one Prince Albert I took a century ago. A local outfitter and fly-fishing guide, Lee Livingston Outfitting Inc., guided Prince Albert II and his party through the changing leaves of the forest where they were greeted with splendid mountain views and a few grizzly bear sightings. The trail ride was followed by a luncheon at the Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill Cody’s original hunting lodge on the Shoshone National Forest. While enjoying the splendor of the historic lodge, guests were treated to the history of the original hunting trip, as well as stories about Prince Albert I and Buffalo Bill Cody.

"Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 25,  Bob Goodwin, a former California Highway Patrol officer, now works for the U.S. Forest Service as a Tribal relations advisor. (U.S. Forest Service photo) During his 21 years as a California Highway Patrol officer, Bob Goodwin eased tensions during traffic accidents, issued verbal warnings and made arrests—all in a calm and cool way. Now, as Tribal relations advisor for the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Region, Goodwin is again relying on those valuable people and negotiating skills to build relations between Tribal entities and the federal government. Goodwin’s easy-going demeanor, “can do” attitude, and ability to resolve challenging issues make him perfect for the job. As tribal relations advisor, Goodwin, 50, who grew up in Northern California, provides advice and guidance to the regional forester on issues that concern Native Americans. He also works with the region’s national forests and ranger districts on projects that may have an effect on traditional, cultural sites. Goodwin is often called upon to ensure smooth relations when the interests of tribal entities and the Forest Service conflict. He is currently working with the tribes as the Forest Service implements the Forest Plan Revision on the region’s Inyo, Sequoia and Sierra national forests. The Forest Plan instructs the Forest Service on how to manage the resources of a national forest. While the issues have been challenging, Goodwin views the exercise as an opportunity for the Forest Service to strengthen relationships with its tribal partners. “My experiences with the (California Highway Patrol) got me into situations that were very stressful or difficult, where I had to look at all the possibilities on how these things could be resolved,” said Goodwin. Along with his experience with the highway patrol, Goodwin, who is an enrolled member of the Karuk Tribe part Karuk, was elected to the Karuk Tribal Council and served two four-year terms. Despite his tribal connection and experience, he was uncertain about applying for the position with the Forest Service because he wondered whether he could serve the needs of both the agency and the Tribes. But after careful consideration, he determined that his unique experience brings an understanding that would be valuable for both parties. Goodwin says he is particularly interested in protecting natural resources and developing stewardship opportunities for all tribes across the state. “Bob has first-hand experience from the tribal side which gives him a leg up in the job,” said Leaf Hillman, director of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy for the Karuk Tribe.  “He handles tough situations calmly and doesn’t get rattled.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  California  Forestry  FS  Inyo National Forest  Native Americans  OTR  Sequoia National Forest  Sierra National Forest  Tribal","What unique experience and perspective does Bob Goodwin, as a former Highway Patrol officer and Karuk tribal member, bring to his role as Tribal relations advisor for the U.S. Forest Service?","* His background as a calm and effective mediator in stressful situations during his time with the Highway Patrol * His personal connection to the Karuk Tribe through his tribal membership and past service on the Karuk Tribal Council * A firsthand understanding of both the federal agency's perspective and the needs of Native American communities This blend of experiences allows him to navigate complex relationships between the Forest Service and tribal entities, making him well-suited for his role."

"USDA Forest Service Chief in  USDA Results  Forestry  Nov 22,  Untreated ponderosa pine woodland compared to an area restored by the Greater Flagstaff Forest Partnership working with the Forest Service in on the Coconino National Forest in Arizona. While people have squabbled over the direction of federal forest management, many landscapes have declined. Take southwestern ponderosa pine, for example. Where thick grasses once waved under big orange-barked pines, thickets of spindly trees now threaten natural and human communities alike through outbreaks of insects and disease, followed by devastating fires. Now people are joining together around common conservation goals to restore landscapes like these. The U.S. Forest Service is working with partners to restore healthy watersheds capable of delivering all the values and benefits that Americans want and need. The goal is to restore landscapes that future generations will describe with the same awe inspired in the first European visitors. In Arizona, environmentalists, local officials, and others have coalesced behind a Forest Service initiative to furnish small-diameter materials from four overgrown national forests to local mills and bioenergy facilities. “I’m hoping to look back on this day as the official end of the forest wars,” said Todd Schulke of the Center for Biological Diversity. The time is right for a restoration economy. The Forest Service is tailoring its programs and projects to a new management environment associated with climate change, demographic growth, and other large-scale drivers of landscape changes that are undermining the health of America’s forests and grasslands. Restoration treatments are based on collaboration with stakeholders to achieve mutual goals across entire landscapes, leading to more jobs and a better future for forest-based communities hard hit by recession. A restoration economy will take time to develop. It will take years to establish confidence and mutual goodwill, overcoming lingering doubts and festering fears and suspicions. In time, however, Americans can unite to achieve their mutual restoration goals through landscape-scale conservation. Joining together, we can link ecological restoration to jobs and economic opportunities for communities across the nation, for the sake of generations to come.

"National Program Leader with the Division of Youth and 4-H, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Oct 19,  Since its creation more than 100 years ago, 4-H has expanded its focus from the field to the lab to keep pace with developments in agricultural techniques and technologies. Photo courtesy of 4-H. National 4-H Week happens each October, a time when nearly six million youth celebrate their participation in 4-H.  Every year, clubs around the country showcase the great things that 4-H offers young people and highlight the incredible things they do to make a positive impact in their communities. The 4-H clover is one of the most recognized in the country, but it wasn’t always that way.  Like most things, it grew – this case from three leaves. The seeds of 4-H were planted at the start of the 20th century by several adults in different states who were concerned about young people. Clark County, Ohio, claims credit as being the birthplace of 4-H, although the initial groups were called “The Tomato Club” or the “Corn Club.” The times were ripe for a new youth innovation like 4-H. During the late s, public universities’ researchers saw that adults in the farming communities did not readily accept the new agricultural discoveries being developed on campuses, such as hybrid seed corn, milk sanitation and home canning procedures. However, they found that young people were open to new thinking. Rural youth programs became an innovative way to introduce new agricultural technology to their communities. In , Iowa school superintendents Jessie Field Shambaugh and O.H. Benson developed a 3-leaf clover pin with an “H” on each leaf to signify “head,” “heart,” and “hands.” In a meeting, club leaders approved the design of a 4-leaf clover with an H on each leaf, adding “health.” By , the groups were becoming known as 4-H clubs. Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act in , creating the Cooperative Extension System at USDA, which included work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. This action effectively nationalized the 4-H program. Between and , clubs were formed at some historically black land-grant colleges in Southern states opening up 4-H to more African-American youth. As 4-H grew, its focus moved beyond the translation of science to include personal growth so that youth could gain skills to help them transition to adulthood in a contributing, productive and self-directed manner. With its national headquarters located within USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), today 4-H serves nearly 6 million youth in rural, urban and suburban communities in every state and many U.S. military installations around the world. Today’s 4-H’ers tackle the nation's top issues, from global food security, climate change and sustainable energy to childhood obesity and food safety. To improve the nation's ability to compete in key scientific fields and take on the leading challenges of the 21st century, 4-H programs offer a wide variety of science, engineering, technology and applied math educational opportunities, including agricultural sciences, rocketry, robotics, environmental protection and computer science.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 08,  Victoria LeBeaux, national program leader with the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. Photo by Carlos Harris There is no one-size-fits-all approach to career development and, according to one of the nation’s new leaders in agriculture, the course one steers toward a profession in agriculture can be as varied and diverse as the population itself. “I’m not a big fan of the term ‘pipeline’ because it implies that there is only one way in and only one direction you can go,” said Dr. Victoria LeBeaux, a national program leader (NPL) with USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  “If that were true I certainly wouldn’t be here, since I had no intention of studying agriculture.” As an undergraduate, she studied economics with the goal of working in international development. Prior to starting her doctorate in sustainable agriculture, LeBeaux lived in rural areas in France and Austria and volunteered in Mexico.  Iowa State University ultimately recruited her to complete doctoral training in a three-year NIFA-funded National Needs Fellowship (NNF) program. NNF trains students for masters and doctoral degrees. In some cases it also provides additional post-doctoral training for the Fellows.  For LeBeaux, that additional training meant a six-month stint in Guatemala where she examined how technical assistance providers helped enhance regional food security by advancing sustainable agriculture practices. LeBeaux returned to NIFA in after completing her Ph.D. and subsequent postdoctoral studies, and became an NPL in NIFA’s Division of Community and Education.  In that role she manages about $10 million in federal funding that supports secondary and postsecondary research, education and extension in the food, agricultural, and human sciences. These programs include the Educational Literacy Initiative’s Research and Extension for Undergraduates (REEU) fellowships program.  REEU provides experiential learning opportunities for underrepresented and first-generation college students. In addition, she uses her scientific training to represent NIFA in federal initiatives like USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, which helps coordinate USDA programs to strengthen local and regional food networks nationwide. “I sincerely appreciate the opportunities provided though the NNF program,” she said.  “As with many other young people, pursuing doctoral education was not on my radar and would not have been possible had I not had the financial support provided by the grant.  I think we need to create a diverse array of pathways to link young people to careers in agriculture and to show them that whatever they are interested in, there are opportunities in agriculture.” NIFA programs offer grants for K-12 schools and community colleges, such as The Secondary Education, Two-Year Postsecondary Education, and Agriculture in the K-12 Classroom Challenge Grants (SPECA) program; funding for undergraduate and masters level education such as the Higher Education Challenge Grants program and the Multicultural Scholars Program (MSP); and support for doctoral studies is provided by the NNF Fellowship and the Education and Literacy Initiative. NNF supports 45 new masters and doctoral students each year, while MSP supports 35 undergrads. Beyond grants, there are many other ways people can benefit from NIFA. For example, educators can access free curriculum from AITC through its Curriculum Matrix. NIFA is also the home of 4-H National Headquarters that supports the positive youth leadership development. NIFA is also a key partner with the Cooperative Extension Service, which operates offices across the country to provide community education in agriculture, health, nutrition, personal finances, and more.

USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is the home of 4-H National Headquarters and provides funding and national program leadership to 4-H. “Besides having a great time at summer camp, making new friends, and creating memories that will last a lifetime, youth who attend Air Force 4-H Camps develop a variety of life skills, experience independence, foster teamwork, enhance communication, and increase social skills while having fun with other military youth,” said David Brittain, North Carolina State University 4-H extension associate with the Air Force 4-H Partnership. The 4-H Military Partnerships Program provides support to military-connected youth whether they live on or near an installation, in the United States or overseas. Despite the frequent moves of military families, 4-H clubs provide consistency in belonging and the chance to develop life skills through a positive youth development framework. 4-H programs integrate the research-based programs and resources of the nation’s land-grant universities to help youth excel. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"New SNAP E&T Initiatives Aim to Help SNAP Participants Find Jobs  Getting a good job these days takes more than good intentions because today’s jobs require a higher level of skills than ever before.  This is why the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s Employment and Training Program (SNAP E&T), administered by states across the country, has such an important role to play in helping SNAP recipients gain the skills they need to find and keep good jobs.  This is also why the U.S. Department of Agriculture is committed to supporting this effort. USDA demonstrated that commitment in two new initiatives launched just this week, the SNAP E&T Learning Academy and a new website for the innovative SNAP to Skills Project, led by the Food and Nutrition Service. The Academy breaks new ground, as a first-ever opportunity that will help address an identified need. You see, though SNAP E&T programs operate across America, we’ve found that there is an opportunity for further sharing of best practices and lessons learned by developing resources that spread the knowledge base throughout the country. The two new projects launched this week will use a “train-the-trainer” model to create new leadership capacity to build the next generation of SNAP E&T programs.

"NRCS Recovery Act Project Helps Provide New Starts for Residents   For more than 45 years, people who lived in West Virginia’s Dunloup Creek Watershed have dealt with floods. That’s because there’s a scarcity of flat land in the area and residents have had to settle mostly along the creek—the very area that floods during storms. Two major floods in and devastated five low-income communities spread out across two counties in the watershed. The floods destroyed houses, ate away at the stream bank, polluted drinking water and washed away utilities. Damages totaled millions of dollars. Because of the mountainous terrain and far-flung population, traditional flood control measures like dams, channels, floodwalls, dredging and flood proofing were not feasible. Yet many residents were trapped into living in their damaged homes, unable to move out because of perilous financial circumstances.

"Trashy Life: Crayfish Turn Rubbish into a Home  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. To raccoons, snakes and opossums, crayfish look pretty tasty, and large crayfish will even cannibalize their smaller kin. Crayfish, which live in rivers and streams, need instream cover to hide from all their predators. They also use cover to find food, to shelter while incubating eggs, and to keep themselves from being washed away in floods. Susan Adams, a fisheries research scientist for the Forest Service’s Southern Research Station, examined different types of cover in the Yazoo River basin of Mississippi to see whether crayfish used large pieces of household trash for shelter when natural cover was limited. Her findings recently appeared in the journal Environmental Management.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA, Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Research and Science  Sep 13,  The brown marmorated stink bug, a winged pest from Asia that is eating crops and infesting U.S. homes. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are launching a campaign to ask volunteers to count the number of stink bugs in their homes. USDA-ARS photo by Stephen Ausmus. Calling all insect enthusiasts and frustrated gardeners!  USDA scientists need your help in documenting Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs (BMSB) in your home. Beginning September 15th through October 15th, we’re asking citizens across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to record daily counts of this pest on the exterior of their homes, along with their location and the time of each count. While USDA scientists are focusing on the Mid-Atlantic region, any they can get from other U.S. regions would also be helpful to their research. The quest to find out just how many stink bugs there are, and how they behave, is the brainchild of a consortium of researchers from USDA, the University of Maryland, Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, Virginia Tech, the Northeastern IPM Center, Oregon State University, North Carolina State University, Cornell University, the University of Delaware and Washington State University. This project is represented on the website, “Stop BMSB (www.stopbmsb.org),” which was launched in . The project involves more than 50 scientists who are investigating the impact BMSB have on grapes, orchard crops, small fruits, ornamental crops and vegetables, as well as ways to prevent or minimize the pest’s impact. BMSB have been found in 40 states and have caused the most damage in the Mid-Atlantic region. The value of at-risk crops where BMSB have been established or identified exceeds $21 billon. Because landscape features such as woodlands, structures, roads and different land use types affect the spread of the insects, it is important to collect related to BMSB locations. BMSB survive cold winter temperatures near farmland in homes, office buildings and warehouses. Scientists are just beginning to understand how landscape features will be a key component in combating stink bugs. Volunteers willing to count their stink bugs can contact USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologists Tracy Leskey (tracy.leskey@ars.usda.gov), Doo-Hyung Lee or Torri Hancock at 725-, at the ARS Appalachian Fruit Research Laboratory in Kearneysville, West Virginia.

"State and Private Forestry, and Robert Westover, Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 26,  A forest visitor admires an old growth forest on the Mt. Hood National Forest. (U.S. Forest Service photo) The U.S. Forest Service wants you to remember the last time you lay on the grass and looked up and were inspired by tree branches swaying in the breeze—or when you sat under an old oak tree feeling the rough bark of its trunk against your back. If you can’t remember, or you’ve never done these things you should because according to the Arbor Day Foundation, America has the “grandest trees on earth – the largest, the oldest and some of the most magnificent.” Today, April 26, is National Arbor Day. Take a moment to celebrate trees and all they provide for us. There are so many things most of us don’t know about trees and Arbor Day is a great time to learn a thing or two. For instance, did you know the mighty oak tree is America’s national tree? In fact, each state celebrates their own Arbor Day and has designated a tree to represent them. Our nation’s capital honors the scarlet oak.  Alaska’s Sitka spruce,  Maine’s eastern white pine, Florida’s cabbage palmetto, Washington state’s  western hemlock and California’s mighty sequoias all paint the landscapes of our lives. Our urban forests, the trees that line our streets and shade our parks and yards, not only add beauty but their shade can help reduce our utility bills. Trees soften the harsh angles of a city’s brick and mortar skyline and add a touch of color; for a moment we can envision what it must have looked like before there was a city. But, you may still be asking yourself:  What else do trees do for me? They also absorb as much as 13 percent of carbon emissions thus cleaning the air that we breathe and reducing the effects of climate change. In short, they make our planet a safer place to live. Forests also help filter nearly half of all the drinking water we need to sustain our lives and they provide the lumber we need to build our homes, make furniture and, in some cases, provide sources of bio-energy to whole communities. So, since trees and our forests do so much for us, why not use Arbor Day as the perfect opportunity to give back by planting trees—lots of them—so that future generations will look back with gratitude for all that we did to help protect and restore our forested lands.

"South Carolina Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 27,  Swales, like this one, were created throughout the wetland to hold water after a rain event, which in turn helps aid in flood storage, enhances plant diversity and provides habitat for wildlife. NRCS photo. A 53-acre conservation easement is an ideal environmental learning lab for students at Francis Hugh Wardlaw Academy in Johnston, South Carolina.  The land was once pastures for cattle, but now it’s a vibrant wetland just across the street from the high school. The contractor hired to install the restoration work, Charles Kemp, was instrumental in involving the school’s students in creating and managing the wetland. “These students are exploring what a career in agriculture or environmental science would be like, and they love being outside and escaping the confines of the classroom,” Kemp said. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service provided technical and financial assistance to develop the restoration plan, and install the structures and earthwork to convert the wet pasture into a functioning wetland. Kemp coordinated with the school’s football coach and director of the agricultural education program, Mark Rodgers, who incorporated the wetland restoration activities into a hands-on learning experience for his students. Several of the students, like senior Jacob Baynham, hope to make farming a career. He will graduate from Wardlaw Academy in a few weeks and will attend an agricultural college in Georgia. “When you plant something and watch it grow, you feel a sense of accomplishment, and conservation is so important when it comes to farming,” Baynham said. Rodgers started the agricultural program two years ago and has been thrilled with the interest and enthusiasm from the students. The students spend 3 to 4 days a week working at the wetland easement.  “I want to inspire these students to care about the environment,” he said. The area was once pastures for livestock. The landowner worked with NRCS through the former Wetlands Reserve Program to create the wetland. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. It’s estimated that 87 percent of the wetland losses from the mid-s to the mid-s were because of conversion to farms and ranches. This program aims to restore wetlands in places where they’re best suited. “We traditionally restore altered or degraded floodplains and forested depressions back to wetlands, so converting this pastureland back to its original hydrologic state was unique,” said Sudie Daves-Thomas, a wildlife biologist with NRCS. When wetlands are drained or altered, this can create very uniform topography through land leveling or other agricultural activities. This wetland restoration plan called for macrotopographic features, which are wetland “ridge and swale” areas. These are areas that will hold water after a rain event, and they create a diversity of water features, which aid in flood storage, enhance plant diversity and provide important wildlife habitat. The students helped create this wetland by planting almost all of the plants there. The area is now teeming with amphibians, birds, beneficial insects and native vegetation. Many migratory birds stop at wetland areas on the way to their winter or summer homes, and more than one-third of the United States’ threatened and endangered species live only in wetlands. This South Carolina wetland is now home to shorebirds, songbirds, waterfowl, egrets and herons. Thanks to the dedication and vision of Kemp and Rodgers, these students are getting a unique educational experience by witnessing what happens when a wetland comes back to life. This May, NRCS is celebrating American Wetlands Month by sharing the stories of wetland restoration, like this one in South Carolina.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Oct 21,  Almond growers are innovative in their water savings. This orchard uses micro-irrigation, which efficiently directs water. Photo courtesy of the Almond Board. It takes a lot of hard work to make a living out of farming, to build a thriving agricultural business and it takes ingenuity. This is especially true in rural America, where dedicated farmers and ranchers rely on each other and the communities around them to fuel innovation and create opportunity. From nutritional research to competitions that promote sustainability and continued environmental care, ag promotion programs—with oversight from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)—help American farmers make long-term investments that ensure a better future for everyone. For more than 30 years, California almond growers have pooled their resources under the Almond Board, focusing on research and techniques to make the most of precious water resources.  Efficient water use and irrigation management are vital to the success of California’s Central Valley almond growers, ensuring that consumer demand for almonds can be met sustainably.  State-of-the-art farming and production developments over the past two decades have helped farmers reduce the amount of water they use per pound of almonds grown by 33 percent. Key strategies have included the wide adoption of micro-irrigation as well as advances in soil assessment and monitoring. Innovative use of wood products is beginning to change the face of construction, and USDA is doing its part to support these advancements. A new prize competition was launched earlier this month, challenging developers, institutions, organizations and design teams to demonstrate the architectural, structural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in tall-wood construction. USDA is investing up to $1 million in the competition and nonprofit partners—the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council—have committed an additional $1 million.

The National Mango Board works with nutrition researchers to explore the connection between eating mangos and healthy skin. Preliminary research published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicates that consuming the 20+ vitamins and minerals found in mangos may protect your skin from damage to due to exposure to Ultra Violet B (UVB) radiation. The Hass Avocado Board also enlists the help of nutrition researchers to study the benefits of consuming avocados. Emerging research suggests that fresh Hass avocados may play a positive role in many areas including heart, eye, cognitive, digestive and cellular health. In particular, the research showed that having avocados with tomato sauce or raw carrots can help the body better use and absorb vitamin A.

"Illinois Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 22,  The wetland in bloom with a more than 100-year-old oak tree standing prominently in the prairie. Natural Land Institute photo. Now, when you look at the Nygren Wetland Preserve in Illinois, a menagerie of wildlife can be seen –  ducks and geese paddling about, white pelicans lounging, otters swimming and a pair of sandhill cranes huddling in a nest. There was talk of the endangered blanding turtles living in the wetland, too. It’s a wonderful scene, but it was much different 14 years ago. The land, located along Raccoon Creek at the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers, was once forests and crops. The Natural Land Institute purchased the land in , and that’s when transformation began. The institute works to create an enduring legacy of natural land in northern Illinois for people, plants and animals. The wetland was made possible by the institute’s partnership with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, along with a trust given to the institute by the Nygren family. NRCS provided $1 million toward the purchase of the 655-acre easement from the land’s original owner. Flooded cropland that eventually became Nygren Wetland Preserve. Natural Land Institute photo. The land was enrolled in the former Wetlands Reserve Program, which provides financial assistance for restoring wetlands. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. “NRCS assistance and countless other partners have helped with developing this property into what it is today and for the general public to enjoy on a daily basis,” said Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist in Winnebago County, Ill. “I think we all should feel good about that.” The Nygren Wetland Preserve includes six types of plant communities, including wetlands, prairie and woodlands. Each requires specific management and maintenance that include re-seeding and prescribed burns. The burns reduce the unwanted plants and stimulate the native grasses. “It has been great working with the entire NLI staff at the Nygren WRP site,” Franks said. “They truly are great conservation stewards and protect the valuable natural resources in northern Illinois.” An extensive flood in caused reed canary grass to take over a portion of the wetland. Reed canary grass is an invasive species that will overtake native plants if not controlled. Kevin Rohling talks about the plants in the wetland with Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist, and Ellen Starr, NRCS area biologist. NRCS photo. “We have an ongoing attempt to eradicate the invasive grass,” said Kevin Rohling, the institute’s stewardship director. The institute also has a reed canary grass experiment plot. “We are attempting to see if we can eradicate the grass without using herbicides,” Rohling said, saying they clip seed heads before seeds are naturally dispersed by the plant. The institute intends to restore the wetland with original grasses and forbs. “Seeds are collected on site, and if not available, we reach out to surrounding areas for those hard to find seeds,” Rohling said. Years ago, Raccoon Creek was straightened to improve farming activities. When deciding how to return the stream to its meandering state, it was discovered the old stream channel was still intact.  Dikes were placed to force the water back to the original channel. Three years later, a study on the meandering creek showed there was a 100 percent increase in fish species and 1,000 percent increase in fish abundance. Partnerships and volunteers have made this wetland what it is today and the volunteers are the heart of the preserve. The Nygren Wetland Preserve not only has tremendous volunteer support but is also located next to three forest preserves. The contiguous preserves provide a large nesting, breeding and flyway for birds, amphibians and mammals, not to mention the enjoyment and educational opportunities for local residents. As beautiful as it is today, the Nygren Wetland Preserve maintenance and support is ongoing. “We are currently assisting them with a restoration contract approved last year to manage 36 acres of reed canary grass and 156 acres of prescribed burning in and ,” Franks said. “They are always excited to try new things at the property and I anticipate us assisting when we are able to in the future.” White pelicans enjoy a rest before moving on to more northern nesting grounds.

"USDA Rural Development State Director for Maine in  Rural  Sep 12,  Partners gather with Andy and Valerie Cole to celebrate a grant the business received to install solar panels on the historic barn that has housed the family business for over a century. Andy and Valerie Cole are the husband and wife team who own Andy’s Agway in rural Dayton, Maine. It’s an impressive operation - in no small part because the Coles still run their agricultural business on the fundamental values their family began with over a century ago. Andy’s Agway started as a family farm purchased just after the Civil War. At first, the farm supplied only the Cole family but slowly it grew to provide for surrounding families, producing vegetables, hay, wood, and ice for nearby communities. In the s, the farm went into dairy production and provided milk deliveries to Biddeford and other towns in southern Maine. Andy Cole, Owner of Andy’s Agway, provides a tour of his business to Bette Brand, USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service. During my visit to Andy’s Agway with USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service Bette Brand, we got the opportunity to meet Andy and Valerie and watch them enthusiastically waiting on customers. Clearly these folks take both agriculture and customer service to heart, and it’s not surprising given that’s what they were raised on. Andy grew up on the family farm, studied Ag Mechanization in college, and began working as a management trainee for Agway as soon as he graduated. His wife Valerie owned horses and many other pets as a child, then studied Animal Science in college. The couple met while working at Agway and made agribusiness their life’s work when they opened the store in Dayton. The business recently received a Rural Energy for America Program Grant from USDA Rural Development to install a solar photovoltaic system nearby the barn that houses the store. This modern technology will help the business save money on energy. The solar panels will save $2,700 per year and generate nearly 29,000 kWh annually, replacing all of the energy needs for their business. Valerie said, “We feel very strongly about reducing our carbon footprint and using resources that are cleaner and greener.” Many things have changed at Andy’s Agway through the years - but not the values that make Andy’s Agway a staple to the local farming and agricultural community. Despite the present-day solar technology near the antique barn, the principles Andy’s Agway was established on generations ago have remained: Christian values, good work ethic, and a positive ‘help-your-neighbor’ attitude that is apparent in the day-to-day operations at the store. The Cole family has remained in agriculture throughout multiple generations because, according to Andy, “We want to help people realize the importance of agriculture, especially local agriculture. We enjoy helping people to be as self-sustaining as they want to be and we make it easy by delivering things right where people want them - whether it’s on the front porch, in the barn, or right on the edge of the garden.” It’s investment in rural small businesses and producers like the Cole family that helps our rural communities not only survive, but thrive – and when rural America thrives, all America thrives. Operations like Andy and Valerie’s Agway are the underpinnings of our nation’s economy, and I’m proud we could be a part of helping them grow.

"Illinois Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 28,  The South Branch Prairie shows vibrant native grasses two years after its restoration. DeKalb County Forest Preserve District photo. If the land floods more often than growing a crop, why not let it go back to what it wants to be – a wetland. That’s what happened on the Hoppe Heritage Farmstead in . The Hoppe sisters owned cropland along the southern branch of the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, Ill. About half of the land would flood on a regular basis. After several years of dealing with the floods, the sisters decided to do something about it. They sold the homestead to the DeKalb County Forest Preserve District, which preserves and restores landscapes and their plant and animal life. Terry Hannan, the forest preserve’s superintendent, contacted USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service about a conservation easement as a possible opportunity to improve the land. NRCS provides technical and financial assistance for wetland restoration projects like this one. The Hoppe sisters enrolled 55 acres land into the former Wetlands Reserve Program. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. “This was a three way deal,” said Paul Searl, a district conservationist with NRCS. “We bought the easement from the sisters, and then they sold the land to the forest preserve. We started the process in early .” Before re-establishing the native plants, extensive research was done to ensure plant were accurate to pre-settlement conditions. Al Roloff, the forest preserve’s natural resources manager, used several reference books as well as records and observations of plant species that exist in local remnant plant communities. NRCS provided six-inch topographic measurements that made planting much easier. The map gives elevations of the land, enabling Roloff to select the proper plants for the soil type.  The lowest elevation, because of the standing water, was planted with root divisions, mud clumps and plugs. Later, when the area dried, he and volunteers scattered seeds by hand of bulrushes, other sedges and forbs. Roloff was excited by the rapid results of their restoration work. “The first year germination rates far surpassed my expectations,” he said. The main threat is the canary reed grass and some cattails, both invasive plants. “The main focus was the vegetation with a concern of invasive species,” Searl said. The tile that originally drained the field was brought to the surface with a riser. Now, instead of water leaving the fields through this drainage system, it holds water on the fields, helping in its transformation to a wetland. After just two growing seasons, the plantings have taken hold dramatically. “The diversity and density of plants has been amazing,” Roloff said. Including the prairie buffer, there are more than 100 different species located in this 55 acre plot. From to , a study was conducted on the mussel populations in the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, including the stretch of river that runs through South Branch Prairie and the connecting Russell Woods Preserve. Mussels are indicators of water quality because their survival rate is lowered when covered with sediment and pollutants. Wetlands improve water quality by filtering nutrients, pollutants and sediment and lead to other environmental benefits, including creating better habitat for mussels. “They found 14 species of mussels in large numbers, much large than anywhere else in the river,” Roloff said. “It is the most rich and diverse portion of the Kishwaukee River.” Roloff said these discoveries help highlight the important of wetlands on water quality. Through NRCS conservation easements, South Branch Prairie, added to the corridor of other existing forest preserves, wildlife has flourished with sightings of bald eagles, sandhill cranes and many different shorebirds. Diversity in plants benefits pollinators, protects the soil and improves water quality. “With the forest preserve and wetland collecting water runoff and filtering it before entering the river,” the water quality in this stretch of the river is the best in northern Illinois,” Searl said.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Fort Collins, CO in  Animals  Plants  Mar 29,  Converting airport grasslands to biofuel, solar or wind production may not only provide more environmentally sound alternative energy sources, but also increase revenue for airports and reduce the local abundance of wildlife hazardous to aircraft. U. S. Department of Agriculture research is helping shed light on this promising concept. USDA photo by David Bergman. Most people are familiar with the weekly summer ritual of mowing the lawn.  At best, the smell of fresh cut grass is appealing, but often the task is considered time consuming, tiring and expensive.  What if your “lawn” was actually hundreds of acres in size, and how often you mowed it, what type of grass you had, and if you used pesticides greatly impacted the safety of nearby residents?  “Mowing the lawn” is just one of the tasks airport managers and biologists confront as they work to keep wildlife away from runways and aircraft. Currently, productive land use near airports is limited and keeping the land fallow is usually the norm.  What airport managers see as a cost of doing business, USDA researcher Dr. Travis DeVault sees as an opportunity. Since , DeVault and colleagues at the National Wildlife Research Center’s Sandusky, Ohio, field station, a part of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have partnered with Mississippi State University researchers to explore alternative uses for lands on and near airports with the goal of reducing wildlife hazards, while also providing a source of revenue for airports. In a recent study, DeVault and colleagues estimated that airport properties in the contiguous United States contain approximately 1,276 square miles of idle grasslands─an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.  In DeVault’s eyes, much of this land could potentially be converted to biofuel, solar or wind production. Researchers and airport biologists with the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Wildlife Services program provides technical assistance to civil and military airports in an effort to reduce wildlife collisions with aircraft. Photo courtesy of USDA. “Though there’s a big push to increase renewable energy production in our country, land managers are cautious about the impacts that wind, solar and biofuel production may have on wildlife and conservation efforts,” notes DeVault.  “Why not locate alternative energy production on and near airports where wildlife presence is already discouraged?” Current research efforts are investigating wildlife use of solar arrays and biofuel crops, such as switchgrass and mixed warm-season grasses. “Our goal is to identify biofuel crops or other renewable energy sources that are undesirable habitats for wildlife hazardous to aviation.  Finding such land uses will not only help reduce wildlife collisions at airports but also promote renewable energy production in areas inappropriate for wildlife conservation.” For more information, please visit NWRC’s reducing wildlife hazards to aircraft project page.

The Wisconsin Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy project was selected March 15 to receive a U.S. Forest Service Wings Across the Americas award for their efforts in wild-bird habitat management. Every year, the Forest Service recognizes outstanding work by partners and local Forest Service employees in conserving habitat for birds, bats and butterflies. This award highlights the outstanding partnership of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Trust for Public Land, and the U.S. Forest Service for work in land stewardship and bird conservation in northwestern Wisconsin. The Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy Program project links over 18,000 acres of resource-rich forest with nearly one million acres of protected forest lands on either side of the Chippewa Flowage Watershed. The program connects the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal land, protected county forest lands and state protected lands. This property is a critical piece of the forest puzzle in the Chippewa Flowage Watershed, the state’s third largest inland body of water, and a world-class fishery for muskellunge and walleye. A conservation easement on this site ensures continued unrestricted access to this Northwoods jewel. This project is located adjacent to the Upper Chippewa Conifer-Hardwood Forest Important Bird Area -- designated by the Audubon Society for providing essential habitat that contributes to the protection of bird populations and communities, including a heron rookery.  Endangered grey wolves are also known to frequent the property. By permanently protecting important forest habitat surrounding the Chippewa Flowage -- one of Wisconsin’s largest wilderness bodies of water -- important ecological, recreational, social, cultural and economic benefits have been preserved for future generations.

But the arid and semi-arid dry lands of about half of both the United States’ and the world’s land surfaces actually are complex ecosystems made up variously of grasses, shrubs, agriculture, and even urban dwellers. Now, ecological education about these complex dry lands has taken a step forward with the publication of a special issue of the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.

"South Carolina Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 27,  Swales, like this one, were created throughout the wetland to hold water after a rain event, which in turn helps aid in flood storage, enhances plant diversity and provides habitat for wildlife. NRCS photo. A 53-acre conservation easement is an ideal environmental learning lab for students at Francis Hugh Wardlaw Academy in Johnston, South Carolina.  The land was once pastures for cattle, but now it’s a vibrant wetland just across the street from the high school. The contractor hired to install the restoration work, Charles Kemp, was instrumental in involving the school’s students in creating and managing the wetland. “These students are exploring what a career in agriculture or environmental science would be like, and they love being outside and escaping the confines of the classroom,” Kemp said. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service provided technical and financial assistance to develop the restoration plan, and install the structures and earthwork to convert the wet pasture into a functioning wetland. Kemp coordinated with the school’s football coach and director of the agricultural education program, Mark Rodgers, who incorporated the wetland restoration activities into a hands-on learning experience for his students. Several of the students, like senior Jacob Baynham, hope to make farming a career. He will graduate from Wardlaw Academy in a few weeks and will attend an agricultural college in Georgia. “When you plant something and watch it grow, you feel a sense of accomplishment, and conservation is so important when it comes to farming,” Baynham said. Rodgers started the agricultural program two years ago and has been thrilled with the interest and enthusiasm from the students. The students spend 3 to 4 days a week working at the wetland easement.  “I want to inspire these students to care about the environment,” he said. The area was once pastures for livestock. The landowner worked with NRCS through the former Wetlands Reserve Program to create the wetland. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. It’s estimated that 87 percent of the wetland losses from the mid-s to the mid-s were because of conversion to farms and ranches. This program aims to restore wetlands in places where they’re best suited. “We traditionally restore altered or degraded floodplains and forested depressions back to wetlands, so converting this pastureland back to its original hydrologic state was unique,” said Sudie Daves-Thomas, a wildlife biologist with NRCS. When wetlands are drained or altered, this can create very uniform topography through land leveling or other agricultural activities. This wetland restoration plan called for macrotopographic features, which are wetland “ridge and swale” areas. These are areas that will hold water after a rain event, and they create a diversity of water features, which aid in flood storage, enhance plant diversity and provide important wildlife habitat. The students helped create this wetland by planting almost all of the plants there. The area is now teeming with amphibians, birds, beneficial insects and native vegetation. Many migratory birds stop at wetland areas on the way to their winter or summer homes, and more than one-third of the United States’ threatened and endangered species live only in wetlands. This South Carolina wetland is now home to shorebirds, songbirds, waterfowl, egrets and herons. Thanks to the dedication and vision of Kemp and Rodgers, these students are getting a unique educational experience by witnessing what happens when a wetland comes back to life. This May, NRCS is celebrating American Wetlands Month by sharing the stories of wetland restoration, like this one in South Carolina. To get started with NRCS, visit your local USDA Service Center or www.nrcs.usda.gov/GetStarted.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Oct 21,  Almond growers are innovative in their water savings. This orchard uses micro-irrigation, which efficiently directs water. Photo courtesy of the Almond Board. It takes a lot of hard work to make a living out of farming, to build a thriving agricultural business and it takes ingenuity. This is especially true in rural America, where dedicated farmers and ranchers rely on each other and the communities around them to fuel innovation and create opportunity. From nutritional research to competitions that promote sustainability and continued environmental care, ag promotion programs—with oversight from USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)—help American farmers make long-term investments that ensure a better future for everyone. For more than 30 years, California almond growers have pooled their resources under the Almond Board, focusing on research and techniques to make the most of precious water resources.  Efficient water use and irrigation management are vital to the success of California’s Central Valley almond growers, ensuring that consumer demand for almonds can be met sustainably.  State-of-the-art farming and production developments over the past two decades have helped farmers reduce the amount of water they use per pound of almonds grown by 33 percent. Key strategies have included the wide adoption of micro-irrigation as well as advances in soil assessment and monitoring. Innovative use of wood products is beginning to change the face of construction, and USDA is doing its part to support these advancements. A new prize competition was launched earlier this month, challenging developers, institutions, organizations and design teams to demonstrate the architectural, structural and commercial viability of using sustainable wood products in tall-wood construction. USDA is investing up to $1 million in the competition and nonprofit partners—the Softwood Lumber Board and the Binational Softwood Lumber Council—have committed an additional $1 million.

"Illinois Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 22,  The wetland in bloom with a more than 100-year-old oak tree standing prominently in the prairie. Natural Land Institute photo. Now, when you look at the Nygren Wetland Preserve in Illinois, a menagerie of wildlife can be seen –  ducks and geese paddling about, white pelicans lounging, otters swimming and a pair of sandhill cranes huddling in a nest. There was talk of the endangered blanding turtles living in the wetland, too. It’s a wonderful scene, but it was much different 14 years ago. The land, located along Raccoon Creek at the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers, was once forests and crops. The Natural Land Institute purchased the land in , and that’s when transformation began. The institute works to create an enduring legacy of natural land in northern Illinois for people, plants and animals. The wetland was made possible by the institute’s partnership with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, along with a trust given to the institute by the Nygren family. NRCS provided $1 million toward the purchase of the 655-acre easement from the land’s original owner. Flooded cropland that eventually became Nygren Wetland Preserve. Natural Land Institute photo. The land was enrolled in the former Wetlands Reserve Program, which provides financial assistance for restoring wetlands. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. “NRCS assistance and countless other partners have helped with developing this property into what it is today and for the general public to enjoy on a daily basis,” said Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist in Winnebago County, Ill. “I think we all should feel good about that.” The Nygren Wetland Preserve includes six types of plant communities, including wetlands, prairie and woodlands. Each requires specific management and maintenance that include re-seeding and prescribed burns. The burns reduce the unwanted plants and stimulate the native grasses. “It has been great working with the entire NLI staff at the Nygren WRP site,” Franks said. “They truly are great conservation stewards and protect the valuable natural resources in northern Illinois.” An extensive flood in caused reed canary grass to take over a portion of the wetland. Reed canary grass is an invasive species that will overtake native plants if not controlled. Kevin Rohling talks about the plants in the wetland with Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist, and Ellen Starr, NRCS area biologist. NRCS photo. “We have an ongoing attempt to eradicate the invasive grass,” said Kevin Rohling, the institute’s stewardship director. The institute also has a reed canary grass experiment plot. “We are attempting to see if we can eradicate the grass without using herbicides,” Rohling said, saying they clip seed heads before seeds are naturally dispersed by the plant. The institute intends to restore the wetland with original grasses and forbs. “Seeds are collected on site, and if not available, we reach out to surrounding areas for those hard to find seeds,” Rohling said. Years ago, Raccoon Creek was straightened to improve farming activities. When deciding how to return the stream to its meandering state, it was discovered the old stream channel was still intact.  Dikes were placed to force the water back to the original channel. Three years later, a study on the meandering creek showed there was a 100 percent increase in fish species and 1,000 percent increase in fish abundance. Partnerships and volunteers have made this wetland what it is today and the volunteers are the heart of the preserve. The Nygren Wetland Preserve not only has tremendous volunteer support but is also located next to three forest preserves. The contiguous preserves provide a large nesting, breeding and flyway for birds, amphibians and mammals, not to mention the enjoyment and educational opportunities for local residents. As beautiful as it is today, the Nygren Wetland Preserve maintenance and support is ongoing. “We are currently assisting them with a restoration contract approved last year to manage 36 acres of reed canary grass and 156 acres of prescribed burning in and ,” Franks said. “They are always excited to try new things at the property and I anticipate us assisting when we are able to in the future.” White pelicans enjoy a rest before moving on to more northern nesting grounds.

"USDA Rural Development State Director for Maine in  Rural  Sep 12,  Partners gather with Andy and Valerie Cole to celebrate a grant the business received to install solar panels on the historic barn that has housed the family business for over a century. Andy and Valerie Cole are the husband and wife team who own Andy’s Agway in rural Dayton, Maine. It’s an impressive operation - in no small part because the Coles still run their agricultural business on the fundamental values their family began with over a century ago. Andy’s Agway started as a family farm purchased just after the Civil War. At first, the farm supplied only the Cole family but slowly it grew to provide for surrounding families, producing vegetables, hay, wood, and ice for nearby communities. In the s, the farm went into dairy production and provided milk deliveries to Biddeford and other towns in southern Maine. Andy Cole, Owner of Andy’s Agway, provides a tour of his business to Bette Brand, USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service. During my visit to Andy’s Agway with USDA Administrator for Rural Business and Cooperatives Service Bette Brand, we got the opportunity to meet Andy and Valerie and watch them enthusiastically waiting on customers. Clearly these folks take both agriculture and customer service to heart, and it’s not surprising given that’s what they were raised on. Andy grew up on the family farm, studied Ag Mechanization in college, and began working as a management trainee for Agway as soon as he graduated. His wife Valerie owned horses and many other pets as a child, then studied Animal Science in college. The couple met while working at Agway and made agribusiness their life’s work when they opened the store in Dayton. The business recently received a Rural Energy for America Program Grant from USDA Rural Development to install a solar photovoltaic system nearby the barn that houses the store. This modern technology will help the business save money on energy. The solar panels will save $2,700 per year and generate nearly 29,000 kWh annually, replacing all of the energy needs for their business. Valerie said, “We feel very strongly about reducing our carbon footprint and using resources that are cleaner and greener.” Many things have changed at Andy’s Agway through the years - but not the values that make Andy’s Agway a staple to the local farming and agricultural community. Despite the present-day solar technology near the antique barn, the principles Andy’s Agway was established on generations ago have remained: Christian values, good work ethic, and a positive ‘help-your-neighbor’ attitude that is apparent in the day-to-day operations at the store. The Cole family has remained in agriculture throughout multiple generations because, according to Andy, “We want to help people realize the importance of agriculture, especially local agriculture. We enjoy helping people to be as self-sustaining as they want to be and we make it easy by delivering things right where people want them - whether it’s on the front porch, in the barn, or right on the edge of the garden.” It’s investment in rural small businesses and producers like the Cole family that helps our rural communities not only survive, but thrive – and when rural America thrives, all America thrives. Operations like Andy and Valerie’s Agway are the underpinnings of our nation’s economy, and I’m proud we could be a part of helping them grow.

"The Benefits of Studying a Domestic Goat with an Interesting History  In much of the developing world, goats are essential for survival and are highly valued for their meat, milk and hides. So it should come as no surprise that Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and academic and industry colleagues, working with DNA from a domestic goat, used new technologies to develop a vastly improved and relatively inexpensive reference goat genome. This information will serve as a kind of instruction manual for scientists showing them how to use the same technologies to lower the cost of developing improved livestock genomes.

"Illinois Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 28,  The South Branch Prairie shows vibrant native grasses two years after its restoration. DeKalb County Forest Preserve District photo. If the land floods more often than growing a crop, why not let it go back to what it wants to be – a wetland. That’s what happened on the Hoppe Heritage Farmstead in . The Hoppe sisters owned cropland along the southern branch of the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, Ill. About half of the land would flood on a regular basis. After several years of dealing with the floods, the sisters decided to do something about it. They sold the homestead to the DeKalb County Forest Preserve District, which preserves and restores landscapes and their plant and animal life. Terry Hannan, the forest preserve’s superintendent, contacted USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service about a conservation easement as a possible opportunity to improve the land. NRCS provides technical and financial assistance for wetland restoration projects like this one. The Hoppe sisters enrolled 55 acres land into the former Wetlands Reserve Program. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. “This was a three way deal,” said Paul Searl, a district conservationist with NRCS. “We bought the easement from the sisters, and then they sold the land to the forest preserve. We started the process in early .” Before re-establishing the native plants, extensive research was done to ensure plant were accurate to pre-settlement conditions. Al Roloff, the forest preserve’s natural resources manager, used several reference books as well as records and observations of plant species that exist in local remnant plant communities. NRCS provided six-inch topographic measurements that made planting much easier. The map gives elevations of the land, enabling Roloff to select the proper plants for the soil type.  The lowest elevation, because of the standing water, was planted with root divisions, mud clumps and plugs. Later, when the area dried, he and volunteers scattered seeds by hand of bulrushes, other sedges and forbs. Roloff was excited by the rapid results of their restoration work. “The first year germination rates far surpassed my expectations,” he said. The main threat is the canary reed grass and some cattails, both invasive plants. “The main focus was the vegetation with a concern of invasive species,” Searl said. The tile that originally drained the field was brought to the surface with a riser. Now, instead of water leaving the fields through this drainage system, it holds water on the fields, helping in its transformation to a wetland. After just two growing seasons, the plantings have taken hold dramatically. “The diversity and density of plants has been amazing,” Roloff said. Including the prairie buffer, there are more than 100 different species located in this 55 acre plot. From to , a study was conducted on the mussel populations in the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County, including the stretch of river that runs through South Branch Prairie and the connecting Russell Woods Preserve. Mussels are indicators of water quality because their survival rate is lowered when covered with sediment and pollutants. Wetlands improve water quality by filtering nutrients, pollutants and sediment and lead to other environmental benefits, including creating better habitat for mussels. “They found 14 species of mussels in large numbers, much large than anywhere else in the river,” Roloff said. “It is the most rich and diverse portion of the Kishwaukee River.” Roloff said these discoveries help highlight the important of wetlands on water quality. Through NRCS conservation easements, South Branch Prairie, added to the corridor of other existing forest preserves, wildlife has flourished with sightings of bald eagles, sandhill cranes and many different shorebirds. Diversity in plants benefits pollinators, protects the soil and improves water quality. “With the forest preserve and wetland collecting water runoff and filtering it before entering the river,” the water quality in this stretch of the river is the best in northern Illinois,” Searl said.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Fort Collins, CO in  Animals  Plants  Mar 29,  Converting airport grasslands to biofuel, solar or wind production may not only provide more environmentally sound alternative energy sources, but also increase revenue for airports and reduce the local abundance of wildlife hazardous to aircraft. U. S. Department of Agriculture research is helping shed light on this promising concept. USDA photo by David Bergman. Most people are familiar with the weekly summer ritual of mowing the lawn.  At best, the smell of fresh cut grass is appealing, but often the task is considered time consuming, tiring and expensive.  What if your “lawn” was actually hundreds of acres in size, and how often you mowed it, what type of grass you had, and if you used pesticides greatly impacted the safety of nearby residents?  “Mowing the lawn” is just one of the tasks airport managers and biologists confront as they work to keep wildlife away from runways and aircraft. Currently, productive land use near airports is limited and keeping the land fallow is usually the norm.  What airport managers see as a cost of doing business, USDA researcher Dr. Travis DeVault sees as an opportunity. Since , DeVault and colleagues at the National Wildlife Research Center’s Sandusky, Ohio, field station, a part of the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, have partnered with Mississippi State University researchers to explore alternative uses for lands on and near airports with the goal of reducing wildlife hazards, while also providing a source of revenue for airports. In a recent study, DeVault and colleagues estimated that airport properties in the contiguous United States contain approximately 1,276 square miles of idle grasslands─an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.  In DeVault’s eyes, much of this land could potentially be converted to biofuel, solar or wind production. Researchers and airport biologists with the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Wildlife Services program provides technical assistance to civil and military airports in an effort to reduce wildlife collisions with aircraft. Photo courtesy of USDA. “Though there’s a big push to increase renewable energy production in our country, land managers are cautious about the impacts that wind, solar and biofuel production may have on wildlife and conservation efforts,” notes DeVault.  “Why not locate alternative energy production on and near airports where wildlife presence is already discouraged?” Current research efforts are investigating wildlife use of solar arrays and biofuel crops, such as switchgrass and mixed warm-season grasses. “Our goal is to identify biofuel crops or other renewable energy sources that are undesirable habitats for wildlife hazardous to aviation.  Finding such land uses will not only help reduce wildlife collisions at airports but also promote renewable energy production in areas inappropriate for wildlife conservation.” For more information, please visit NWRC’s reducing wildlife hazards to aircraft project page.

The Wisconsin Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy project was selected March 15 to receive a U.S. Forest Service Wings Across the Americas award for their efforts in wild-bird habitat management. Every year, the Forest Service recognizes outstanding work by partners and local Forest Service employees in conserving habitat for birds, bats and butterflies. This award highlights the outstanding partnership of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Trust for Public Land, and the U.S. Forest Service for work in land stewardship and bird conservation in northwestern Wisconsin. The Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy Program project links over 18,000 acres of resource-rich forest with nearly one million acres of protected forest lands on either side of the Chippewa Flowage Watershed. The program connects the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal land, protected county forest lands and state protected lands. This property is a critical piece of the forest puzzle in the Chippewa Flowage Watershed, the state’s third largest inland body of water, and a world-class fishery for muskellunge and walleye. A conservation easement on this site ensures continued unrestricted access to this Northwoods jewel. This project is located adjacent to the Upper Chippewa Conifer-Hardwood Forest Important Bird Area -- designated by the Audubon Society for providing essential habitat that contributes to the protection of bird populations and communities, including a heron rookery.  Endangered grey wolves are also known to frequent the property.

"Senior Technical Advisor, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  May 01,  Most Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants who can work already do. SNAP’s food assistance benefits are critical to helping these workers put food on the table as the jobs they hold often pay low wages, offer unreliable hours, and don’t provide benefits like paid sick leave. Reliable, high-quality work is a powerful way out of poverty, and USDA’s SNAP Employment and Training (SNAP E&T) helps gain professional skills and connections to better employment opportunities. While SNAP state agencies are responsible for operating SNAP E&T programs, they work closely with other partners who have expertise in building strong employment programs like the Department of Labor, local job centers, and SNAP E&T professionals. In , USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service awarded a SNAP E&T National Partnership Grant to the National Association of Workforce Boards (NAWB) to provide technical assistance to state and local workforce development boards, so they can become SNAP E&T providers. Since then, NAWB has continued its work to expand SNAP E&T’s footprint. We all have a shared goal of matching job seekers with sustainable employment opportunities, and it only makes sense to bring everyone’s strengths to the table. Most conversations about SNAP E&T and its broader connection to the workforce development system often begin by identifying the differences between E&T and other workforce programs; however, our partnership with NAWB has highlighted many opportunities for partnership. These important conversations are just some of the ways USDA is working to connect SNAP E&T participants to jobs and careers that offer a way out of poverty.

"Public Affairs Branch Chief, USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Apr 27,  WIC is one of the most powerful, evidence-based public health programs, setting moms, babies, and young kids up to be healthy and thrive. The program is associated with incredible outcomes like improved diet quality, birth weights, and cognitive development, and reduced infant deaths, premature births, and health care costs. It’s no wonder more than six million women, infants, and children across America participate in the program. But still, that’s only about half of those who are eligible, which means millions are missing out on WIC’s proven benefits. (Check out our National and State Level Estimates of WIC Eligibility and Program Reach in webpage for really cool, interactive charts showing program eligibility and reach by age, race, gender, military status, and more.) WIC has the potential to help so many more. USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service is working hard to get more eligible families connected to WIC. One of the ways we’re doing that is by making it easier to enroll. We’re encouraging state agencies to continue allowing participants to enroll in and receive WIC benefits virtually as well as in-person. We’re also leveraging sharing across government programs to streamline WIC enrollment. In line with the Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery and the Biden-Harris Administration National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, FNS is encouraging states to easily connect eligible moms and kids who already participate in programs like SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid with WIC benefits. As part of that effort, we’re investing in a cooperative agreement that will provide subgrants and support to WIC state agencies to expand the use of sharing to identify, refer, and enroll eligible participants. We encourage colleges, universities, and nonprofits to apply. USDA believes a healthier future starts with our children, and these steps will help give our nation’s youngest the best possible start through WIC.

"PhD, RDN, Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Jul 20,  Almost a year and a half ago, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack outlined USDA’s focus on nutrition security, which builds on food security by emphasizing the co-existence of food insecurity and diet-related diseases and disparities. Put simply, nutrition security means having consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being. It’s my honor and privilege to join this effort as the second director of nutrition security and health equity at the Food and Nutrition Service within USDA and lead the department’s approach to advancing food and nutrition security. In this role, I will work to elevate the administration of USDA’s 16 nutrition assistance programs. These programs reach one in four Americans over the course of a year, and they are some of the most far-reaching, powerful tools in the federal government to help ensure that everyone — of all demographic groups and life stages—experiences nutrition security. Every day, USDA works hard (, 792 ) to connect nutritious foods to those most in need. Part of this work includes leveraging the momentum (, 10.0 ) of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health and the corresponding National Strategy, which set ambitious goals to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. We are also working to better integrate nutrition and health. Since hosting a National Summit this past fall, USDA has participated in three regional summits hosted by ProMedica and The Root Cause Coalition. We look forward to participating in their four remaining summits. We have learned so much about the power of integrating nutrition and health and the power of our partners in healthcare. I am excited to work across our department and with our partners in government, non-government organizations, and people working in communities across America to continue building awareness of our efforts and identify opportunities for collaboration. This work includes building new and enhancing collaborative activities with our National MyPlate Strategic Partners, SNAP-Ed implementing agencies, and everyone committed to advancing food and nutrition security. I know these programs are key ingredients to our work ahead. I know this firsthand through my experience as a community engaged researcher, like when a parent told me their child requested broccoli and kiwi after participating in our SNAP-Ed supported programming. That’s the power of USDA programs! Building on the momentum of this past year and half, we are excited to release a new video explaining USDA’s efforts to promote nutrition security. Please share this video to help spread the word about ways we are partnering to connect individuals, families, and communities across this country with foods that support optimal health and well-being. Everyone in this country deserves the opportunity the thrive. Let’s work together to reach the goals in our National Strategy and provide meaningful nutrition support for all.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 12,  NRCS Chief Jason Weller (far right) completes his tour of acequias in New Mexico at the oldest continuously functioning acequia in the United States – the Acequia de Chamita, near Espanola, New Mexico – in operation since . With Chief Weller are (left to right) Gilbert Borrego, NRCS New Mexico Acequia Civil Engineering Technician; Kenny Salazar, President of the New Mexico Association of Conservation Districts; and Bren van Dyke, First Vice President of the National Association of Conservation Districts. Photo by Rey T. Adame. Last week, I visited with local communities in northern New Mexico. Many of these communities rely on irrigation ditches, called acequias, as their primary water source in an otherwise arid region. These are ditches that were used by their parents, and their grandparents, and their great-grand parents. Some acequias in the area date back more than 400 years. Through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), NRCS is working with acequia communities and partners across the state of New Mexico to improve water quality, water quantity, and boost the overall health of these local irrigation ditches that so many rural American communities depend on. The Acequia San Rafael del Guique, for example, provides water for roughly 150 people in the Ohkay Owengeh and El Guique communities – it’s being revitalized as part of our RCPP project in the state. This is one of 115 conservation projects currently being funded by RCPP in all 50 states and Puerto Rico. Together, USDA investments and partner contributions have brought our total conservation investment through RCPP to almost $800 million – and we’re just getting started. Last week, Secretary Vilsack announced that the second round of RCPP funding is now available. A new bucket of $235 million will be put to work funding innovative new projects to benefit our soils, water, and wildlife. RCPP is an example of government working at its best. We’re empowering local communities and private landowners to take control and identify what the needs are in their backyards. We’re harnessing the power of public-private partnership – bringing in new partners, new resources and new ideas to the table, resulting in conservation outcomes that we never could have realized on our own. Just like the first round of RCPP, 25 percent of the funding will be awarded to state-level projects; 40 percent for multi-state and national projects; and 35 percent for projects in eight Critical Conservation Areas, including: the California Bay Delta; Chesapeake Bay Watershed; Colorado River Basin; Columbia River Basin; Great Lakes Region; Longleaf Pine Range; Mississippi River Basin; and the Prairie Grasslands. We’re looking for projects that deliver the most conservation for the tax payer dollar – and leverage additional financial and technical resources to get the job done. We’re looking for innovation. We’re looking for ideas that help producers boost their operations and mitigate threats, while meeting regulations and protecting the natural resources we all depend on. Seeing how our investments are changing lives for families in acequia communities in New Mexico and communities across the country pushes me to be a better public servant.  I’m grateful for these opportunities. I’m eager to see our current RCPP projects come to fruition and the new ideas coming to the table in the months ahead.

"Communications Director, USDA Office of Research, Education, and Economics in  Initiatives  May 06,  The USDA and the Council of Universities today renewed their memorandum of understanding that reaffirms and sustains the partnership between USDA and the historically black colleges created under the Second Morrill Act of for an additional five years. Dr. Juliette Bell, President of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore and Chair of the Council of Universities of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, signed the agreement with Secretary Vilsack. This year celebrates 125 years of the signing of the second Morrill Act, which led to the creation of 19 historically black land-grant colleges and universities. (USDA Photo by Bob Nichols)  Congress enacted the Second Morrill Act, creating a group of African-American land-grant universities, in the year .  Today – 125 years later – USDA maintains a close, supportive and cooperative relation with these 19 schools located in 18 states that are commonly known as “ Universities.”   This morning in a ceremony in his office, Secretary Vilsack signed an agreement extending USDA’s commitment to the Universities for another five years. Also signing the agreement was Dr. Juliette Bell, President of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES), acting on behalf of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities’ (APLU) Council of Universities.  Secretary Vilsack spoke of the importance of extending the partnership between these universities and USDA, saying it was “more important than ever to train the next generation of policy makers, researchers and educators in the food and agricultural sciences.” The legislation gave states funds to establish state universities for persons of color if race was an admissions factor at the existing state university. Over the years, these institutions have a track record of “serving the underserved” and “reaching the unreached.” Today, Universities are proud to remain the custodians of access to and opportunity for higher education in underserved communities. With today’s signing ceremony, USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) will continue to support internships, training, technical assistance, faculty exchange opportunities, increased mentoring and other collaborative environmental and public health activities. One example of this frequent collaboration can be seen this graduation season.  Secretary Vilsack gave the commencement address at Florida A&M University earlier this month.  Dr. Catherine Woteki, USDA’s Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education, and Economics, also underscored the importance of Universities in a speech to UMES students celebrating National Day. “The institutions are places of cutting-edge research and technology, empowering many students to become the leaders we need to feed the growing world population,” Woteki said. “With the agricultural challenges looming over us all, it is crucial that we continue to revolutionize agriculture with groundbreaking ideas and build sustainable agricultural systems. “…The best investment we can make, then, is in the most valuable commodity we can cultivate – each of you – by supporting the next generation of food, ag and natural resource scientists and those dedicated to training them.” The complete text of Dr. Woteki’s speech can be found on the REE website.

""The Recovery Act has brought improved water and wastewater services to nearly 1.7 million rural residents,” said the Administrator. Administrator Padalino made his remarks at the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority Treatment Plant in Arkansas. Most people in the U.S. take for granted the fact that safe drinking water is readily available for use by simply turning on a tap, or pushing a button on a fountain.  However, many rural communities within the U.S. must deal with negative impacts associated with contaminated water sources at their homes and schools. In fact, since the ’s there have been efforts to bring safe drinking water to Boone, Newton, and Searcy counties in Arkansas.  Groundwater in this region is often contaminated with naturally occurring random, radium, and fluoride, which water systems must address.   Contaminated ground water is unsafe and unfit for humans to use. USDA funding for the Ozark Mountain Regional Public Water Authority system is used to provide clean, safe water for over 20,000 residents and businesses. In addition to the USDA funding, the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission provided nearly $10 million for the project. Programs like the one which funded the Treatment Plant would not be available without a Food, Farm and Jobs Bill. Rural areas need safe and reliable water for the health of their communities and sustainable economic growth. Since the start of the Obama Administration, USDA has invested more than $218 million, in over 100 water and wastewater programs in rural Arkansas alone.

Aside from the popular standbys like our toll-free Fall Hotline that lets you listen to which forests and grasslands are peaking, and an interactive map that lets you click on the forest nearest you, we’ve added a map that will show you when the leaves are peaking in your state. The new leaf peaking map is pretty simple to figure out. It’s color coded so green is for no change, red means leaves are peaking and brown lets you know the color is basically gone and winter is on its way. Cities are also festooned with in fall as well. The Forest Service works with many municipalities across the country to help keep what we call urban forests healthy. These oases of nature in the middle of the hustle and bustle of city living are particularly stunning as the leaves of thousands of trees begin to change, set against the backdrop of mirrored skyscrapers, manicured parks and street lamp-lined roads. The Forest Service also manages millions of acres of grasslands throughout the mid-section of the country from Texas to North Dakota. Seeing the tall grasses and wildflowers of fall is yet another natural beauty to behold. So let the Forest Service help you plan your Fall adventure!

"Under Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and the Environment and Anne Castle, Assistant Secretary for Water & Science at the Department of the Interior in  Forestry  Sep 12,   Cross posted from the White House Council on Environmental Quality blog: Americans know the importance of forests to our communities and our economy.  They provide jobs and recreational opportunities, filter our air and water, and make up essential habitat for wildlife and natural resources.  But increasingly, we’re also recognizing that forests play an important role in mitigating climate change. Recently, President Obama announced a Climate Action Plan to reduce carbon pollution, prepare for the impacts of climate change on our communities and economy, and lead international efforts to combat global climate change. This plan recognizes that America’s forests play a critical role in addressing carbon pollution, absorbing as much as 14 percent of our country’s greenhouse gas emissions each year.  Over the last several decades, forest regrowth on former farm lands, reforestation, and maturing forests have kept our forest growth rates high, helping us absorb even more carbon. At the same time, development of forest lands is reducing the amount of carbon we can absorb now and in the future.  Carbon pollution is also taking a toll on our forests – heat waves, wildfires, pests and drought are all worsened by climate change, reducing our forests’ ability to sequester carbon. It is difficult to predict precisely how much these impacts will reduce the potential of our forests to combat climate change – but we do know that we must start now to find new ways to enhance forests’ ability to absorb carbon and become more resilient. As part of the President’s Climate Action Plan, the Administration is bringing Federal agencies together to tackle this challenge.  An interagency Task Force is working to provide more accurate and consistent annual updates of carbon fluxes from forests and other lands.  This will help us ensure that we have up-to-date information on how major disturbances like wildfires, as well as land development trends, impact the capacity of the nation’s forests to absorb carbon. It will also provide the tools we need to make more effective policy decisions, ensuring land managers are able to take into account the carbon sequestration value of our forests.   The Task Force is also developing new approaches to retain and restore our forests and other important landscapes like grasslands and wetlands. This initiative will build on the significant work the Administration already has underway to ensure healthy, thriving forests. For example, the Department of Agriculture announced this year the creation of seven new regional hubs to provide research and timely information to farmers and forest landowners as we work together to combat climate change. This work will complement research by DOI Climate Science Centers, in areas such as evaluating management options, projecting forest conditions and carbon storage under climate change, evaluating the effects of changing rainfall and snow conditions, and studying the effects of changing forests on particular species and ecosystem services. This information is helping to inform restoration efforts undertaken by the Forest Service and its partners to make our forests more resilient. And DOI and USDA are working together with other Federal agencies, states, tribes, and private landowners to engage in historic, landscape scale conservation projects that will put critical ecosystems on a stronger footing for the future. Climate change poses a tough new challenge for the forest ecosystems that provide so much for all Americans. Following President Obama’s lead, we’re getting ahead of the game – focusing on new partnerships, strengthening interagency collaboration, and ensuring that the best science is available as we take on climate change in the years to come.

"An Explanation of Green Jobs Policies, Theory, Measurement Approaches, and Job Growth Expectations  A new white paper titled An Explanation of Green Jobs Policies, Theory, Measurement Approaches, and Job Growth Expectations was written by Iowa State University through a cooperative agreement with USDA’s Office of Energy Policy and New Uses.  The authors explore policy, theoretical foundations, and the approaches to measuring green jobs in the United States.  The paper contains brief descriptions of national and state initiatives to quantify green jobs, as well as their potential for growth.  The study finds there is little academic research that conceptualizes the green economy.  Regional research to assist state and local policy development is needed, along with evaluations investigating offsetting job losses. There are currently twin public policy focuses regarding green jobs.  The first concerns imply value of the activity; namely, the ability to conserve energy and other natural resources as well as reduce pollution.  The second focus is the job producing value.  While most people agree that the environmentally beneficial goals of policy developments are essential, the job creation goals are foremost in most policymakers’ minds.

"US Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Mar 02,  The legacy of the Weeks Act is shown by looking at photos of the White Mountain National Forest a century apart. Nearly a 100 years later after being decimated by logging, this photo depicts a healthy restored forest at the same location.  The Weeks Act, which went into effect on March 1, , has been identified as one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation in American history. In the early s the public began to embrace a more proactive attitude toward conserving public lands. Just the year before, in , Gifford Pinchot started the Forest Service. Before the Weeks Act, lands set aside for conservation were all located in the West and were created from large blocks of land in the public domain. Millions of acres of bare, eroded lands dotted the Eastern states from cut-over and farmed-out lands. In the West, the epic wildfires of fueled support for the Act. The most poignant element of the Act was that it gave the federal government authority to buy private lands in the East to establish publicly-owned forests. This provided both immediate and long-term benefits: the immediate protection of eastern watersheds from further development; the creation of a long-term effort to restore forests on public lands; and the beginning of new federal-state cooperative partnership responsibilities to protect these lands from intense and damaging wildfires. The Act’s natural resource conservation success has been profound: it designated 52 national forests in 26 Eastern states and mandated conservation ethics on some 20 million acres of national forests and grasslands across 41 states and Puerto Rico. Today, 80% of the 155 national forests are comprised of lands acquired through the Weeks Act, sustainably managed for a wide variety of conservation purposes. The impact of the Weeks Act is still strong today. America relies on the treasures their forests provide, including clean water, wildlife habitat, recreation, forest products, and a wide range of goods and services. The conservation successes of historic partnerships that created many of our beautiful national forests are an integral part of how the Forest Service continues to do business. The Act has a rich legacy, and the Forest Service remains committed to the tenets of its conservation core and values. The results of the Act support local economies and communities and broad tourism and recreation business sectors, and will extend our natural resource heritage far into the next 100 years.

"Deputy CIO, Policy and Planning in  Conservation  Technology  Jul 14,   Support for those affected by disasters is critical. By developing more comprehensive tools that prepare citizens and government before the next event helps.  Helping communities rebuild and become more resilient to extreme weather in the future is vital. Citizens need to be able to access accurate information in real time, before, during and after these devastating events. The growing open collaboration between producers and users can help with recovery efforts while being more transparent and local. Industry startups and others in the open- space have shown that they are an incredible resource when it comes to creating tools that citizens and government can use to be better prepared for a crisis. Open has made mobile apps possible that identify the location of hundreds of Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) when someone nearby is in need of a lifesaving procedure. Another app maps out all the fire hydrants in Boston, so volunteers can dig them out after a snowstorm. But, more can be done. According to Ann Mills, USDA Deputy Under Secretary of Natural Resources and Environment, “Open and the innovation it supports is essential to supporting 21st century disaster preparedness and planning in a climate changing world.” The USDA Open submission for this quarter concentrated on Disaster Relief . Seventy-four datasets were collected that related to disasters of all kinds.  It is USDA’s goal that the will be used to spur development of the tools necessary which would assist those needing help or those responding to help. We encourage you to use the USDA open sets to create solutions for communities. These datasets could give populations the ability to access the necessary resources in order to be better prepared for a disaster as well as promote economic recovery after one occurs.  Importantly, these resources also could help communities better prepare for future drought and other extreme weather events, and reduce their impact on livelihoods and their economy. We don’t know when the next disaster will strike, but we believe the open- movement is beginning to make government work better, save money and increase transparency. Both the private and public sectors need to step up and make comprehensive disaster preparedness technology a priority.

"Jr., Acting Western Regional Administrator of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Western Region in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 03,  To enjoy nutritious fresh fruit smoothies - Summer Food kickoff participants power a blender using a stationary bicycle. On the grounds of Valley Hi-North Laguna Library in Sacramento, California, upwards of 150 children participated in the California Summer Meals kickoff event hosted by the California Summer Meal Coalition, Sacramento Public Library, and the Elk Grove Unified School District.  USDA’s Summer Food Service Program offers free meals during summer break so kids are better fueled with healthy food to learn and grow all year long. Though the weather approached 100 degrees, the children were not deterred from learning about the importance of healthy meals during the summer months at this event. Across the spacious summer food program kick-off site, children clutched their fresh fruit smoothies created by a blender which was powered by a stationary bicycle.  They also enjoyed a face painting station, a hula-hoop station, bean bag contests, and an FNS trivia game. Holly Prestegaard, Program Specialist of the Western Regional Office of USDA Food and Nutrition Service, with children at the Valley Hi-North Laguna Library in Sacramento, CA. For the parents in attendance, this kick off was just the start.  They are now equipped with information to ensure that their children will have an opportunity to eat nutritious meals this summer. Access to nutritious meals during the months when children are not in school and do not receive a school breakfast or lunch helps them stay both healthy and educationally sharp. That’s why it’s so important that we continue to feed kids during the summer. Food and nutrition partners in California understand that closing the summer meals gap is a team effort.  The collaboration between the California Library Association and California Summer Meal Coalition, in partnership with the Food and Nutrition Service and the California Department of Education raised awareness among families in Sacramento – and across the state – about free, healthy lunches available through the USDA summer meals program. For more information on how USDA works with its partners to prevent child hunger during the summer months please visit our Summer Meals site. There, you can also find out how to locate a summer meals site near you.

"FNS Southwest Regional Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 07,   The No Kid Hungry New Mexico Campaign, an initiative of the New Mexico Collaboration to End Hunger, is gaining partners and momentum.  The campaign is less than a year old, but already progress has been made on the goals: Increasing participation in the summer meals program, school breakfast, and SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.  It’s so important to connect eligible people with the federal nutrition safety net.  And that is exactly what Share Our Strength and its partners are doing in New Mexico and across the nation to end childhood hunger. Part of the No Kid Hungry New Mexico campaign centers on school breakfast, an area of special interest to me. I can see the potential to reach more children just by changing the way breakfast is offered to students. A healthy breakfast makes a big impact on a child’s well being – physically and mentally.  That translates to better attentiveness, performance and behavior in school, too.   This method also eliminates the stigma for low-income children of coming to school early for a free breakfast in the cafeteria. And many children simply can’t get to school before the first bell. Southwest Regional Administrator Bill Ludwig speaks to school superintendents and food service directors about expanding school breakfast at the New Mexico School Breakfast Summit in Albuquerque on Nov. 15.  Part of the No Kid Hungry New Mexico plan includes implementation of alternate service models for school breakfast in high poverty counties.  As part of training and outreach to schools, the New Mexico Collaboration to End Hunger hosted the New Mexico School Breakfast Summit on Nov.  15. Meghann Dallin is the program manager for the New Mexico No Kid Hungry Campaign. She explained that an important goal of the summit was to connect school districts interested in expanding their breakfast programs with the right people. All the key players were there including state organizations that provide support and technical assistance to schools wanting to adopt breakfast models that increase access to the program. I was happy to be a part of the summit and to tell the story of how breakfast in the classroom is already increasing participation in large and small school districts in Texas and Arkansas. Summit sessions included the role of school breakfast in reducing child hunger, alternative breakfast models, tools to facilitate breakfast expansion and lessons learned from successful programs in New Mexico. As in all No Kid Hungry endeavors, key partners came together with the New Mexico Collaboration to End Hunger to plan the summit, including Dairy MAX, the Student Nutrition Bureau of the New Mexico Public Education Department, and the New Mexico School Nutrition Association. I’m proud to be a part of the New Mexico No Kid Hungry initiative which is making all the right connections to end hunger in New Mexico.

"Public Affairs Staff Officer, Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests in  Forestry  Feb 22,  Trail users of all types take part in a Trails 101 course offered through CoTrails in January on the Anna Ruby Falls trail. One of the goals of CoTrails is to educate and engage a robust volunteer force to assist with trail maintenance and planning efforts. Photo credit: USDA Forest Service/Judy Toppins The Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests in Georgia receive 2.2 million visitors each year, and their primary activity is use of 850 miles of designated system trails. But it’s not only hikers that take advantage of the recreation opportunities which these trails provide. Cyclists, hunters, anglers, off-highway vehicle enthusiasts and horseback riders all recreate on national forest trails-- and they don’t always see eye-to-eye. One year ago, the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest embarked on a unique collaborative effort to bring these trail users together to help identify and maintain a diverse, quality trail system on Georgia’s national forests.  By working together with all trail users, the Forest Service created an opportunity to seek new ways to deal with the ever-increasing use of trails, public demand for more trails, limited agency resources to properly maintain existing trails, and potential competition among different trail users. The forests first began the Collaborative Trails Initiative, or “CoTrails,” by hosting a series of meetings in forest communities. How could all trail users work together and with the Forest Service to address shared concerns and find solutions?  More than 350 people attended those meetings. A core group of more than 40 volunteers coalesced to see the effort through the planning stage. The result is a five-part strategic plan launched in January that the Forest Service and an ever-growing number of CoTrails volunteers are beginning to implement. Trail users of all types take part in a Trails 101 course offered through CoTrails in January on the Anna Ruby Falls trail. One of the goals of CoTrails is to educate and engage a robust volunteer force to assist with trail maintenance and planning efforts. Photo credit: USDA Forest Service/Judy Toppins The CoTrails Strategic Plan outlines five objectives. They include engaging volunteers, inventorying and assessing existing trails, creating a forest-wide interactive online map of the trail system and identifying unauthorized trails and opportunities to incorporate new system trails on the national forests. A professional assessment of 200 miles of trails is already underway, and thousands of volunteer hours have already been invested. The far-reaching influence of this effort will benefit more than just trail users by offering a more satisfying recreation experience. It will also protect watersheds, improve forest health and contribute to local and regional economies that depend on forest-related recreation.

"Intermountain Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Dec 06,  The tranquility of winter camping is ideal at the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. Numerous hiking, biking and off-road trails crisscross the area. (U.S. Forest Service) While some may close up tents and winterize recreational vehicles this time of year, there are others who look forward to a winter filled with adventures on forests and grasslands. The draw is yurts and historic cabins available to rent that offer a bit of solitude for camping, a dose of adventure on skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles, and a lifetime of memories. A yurt is a circular tent with canvas walls. There are many different styles and sizes of yurts, but generally each yurt is different in what it offers. Typically, you can expect to provide your own bedding, food, and cooking supplies. Some include beds, tables and chairs. Others have camp stoves and wood burning stoves. Check information on Recreation.gov before making your reservation and committing to a stay. Last year, Johanne Tuttle and her friends chose the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. After skiing three miles to reach the yurt, they found it had a wood-burning stove to keep warm when they finished cross-country skiing or sledding down a small hill. Inside, they could relax, play cards and cook their meals. “We were actually really surprised to get up here and see how spacious the yurt is. It’s really spacious, big huge bunk beds, double sized, so you can easily fit two people on one bed,” Tuttle said. “It’s bigger than any yurt I've ever been in and plenty of room to move around and stretch out.” Tuttle’s group stayed for several days, packing in everything they needed and adhering to outdoor ethics and packing out their trash and leaving the yurt ready for the next campers. Jamie Tyson, Johanne Tuttle, Charity Parks and Chris Berry dine on a meal they cooked in the Grizzly Ridge yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. The yurt comes with bare-bones cooking utensils. (U.S. Forest Service) Staying in a yurt or cabin is easy to do depending on the location of the cabin and whether use is seasonal or year-round. All reservations are made through Recreation.gov. However, most facilities are locked and can be accessed only after contacting the forest or grassland office. And as with any outdoor recreation adventure, preparation is key no matter which season you choose. Be sure you have the appropriate clothing, supplies and a local area map before you head out. The Forest Service offers paper maps for sale and digital maps for iOS and Android smart devices. Still not sure you want to stay in a yurt? To learn more about unique camping experiences on the Ashley National Forest, watch videos on the Grizzly Ridge yurt; Trout Creek Guard Station; and the Carter Military Yurt. Johanne Tuttle, Jamie Tyson, Charity Parks and Chris Berry head out for cross-country skiing after checking into the Grizzly Ridge Yurt on the Ashley National Forest in Utah. The primitive camping site is open year-round but many people are drawn to it for its feeling of isolation and for the cross-country and snowshoeing trails.

It goes without saying a successful statistician must have strong math, analytical and technical skills. You might be surprised to learn, then, just how much of my time is dedicated to listening to and talking with people. To be sure, I still use math and science daily. Two decades into my career, however, it’s those intentional, important interactions with farmers who answer my agency’s requests for information, as well with those who use my agency’s , researchers, analysts and farmers themselves that keep me busiest. Why? Because NASS is the “go to” source for official government statistics on U.S. agricultural production, economics, land, water, energy, environmental management and farmer demographics. Part of my job includes making sure farmers want to respond to our surveys and censuses and that researchers choose to use our because it is the most accurate and unbiased. I’m the grandson of a cattle rancher so intrepid that even after my then seventy-something year-old grandfather was kicked by a horse, he continued to ranch. I like to think I’ve inherited that tenacious nature and apply it to everything I do, even building awareness of the relevance of agricultural statistics. I do this by engaging with people at expos, trade shows, and one-on-one meetings. Somewhere between admiring the butter sculpture, checking out the latest equipment, vehicles, livestock, research, technology and trends, people stop in the NASS booth and we chat. I have found that farmers respond to my agency’s requests for information when they understand how official government statistics help them manage risks, conserve natural resources and promote a healthy agricultural production and marketing system in which they benefit. I spend a good bit of time meeting with farmers at farm shows, agricultural conferences and even at their operations. I also serve as presenter, moderator and panelist at agricultural symposiums and meet with stakeholders at multidisciplinary meetings. I do this to better understand what is happening in American agriculture, what matters to people who rely on agriculture and how my agency can provide the needed to help make sure American agriculture remains healthy and prosperous. Each time I meet with a new producer; a new user, I feel the satisfaction that comes from working at a job I sincerely enjoy.

"Associate Administrator, NASS in  Research and Science  Trade  May 17,  Trucks deliver soybeans for inspection and purchase, then the soybeans are loaded onto barges for shipment to New Orleans and overseas customers. The USDA NASS June Grain Stocks report will indicate how much grain is in storage as of June ates while the June Acreage report reflects farmer-reported principal crop acreage planted as of June 1, valuable supply insights for domestic and world markets. USDA photo by Lance Cheung. With May being World Trade Month, it is worth noting that the source of to determine the U.S. supply of crops and livestock is America’s farmers and ranchers who fill out surveys from USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). These statistics feed directly into the monthly World Supply and Demand Estimates report (WASDE), which shows how much food, feed, fuel, and fiber are available or expected to be available around the world throughout the year. These are available free of charge to anyone who wants them and are widely regarded as the gold standard. Did you know that during the / growing season, farmers and ranchers across the United States produced an estimated 47.4 million metric tons of the world’s estimated 758.4 million metric tons of wheat, according to the May 10, WASDE report? The same report forecasts world wheat production for the / growing season to be 747.8 million metric tons – 10.6 million metric tons less than last year, of which 49.6 million metric tons is forecast to be U.S. production. NASS collects and these U.S. , and those for dozens of other agricultural products, every month with information gathered directly from farmers and ranchers. Additional information is collected and reported every quarter. A series of each year – March Prospective Plantings, June Acreage, September Small Grains Summary, and the January Annual Crop Production , along with Grain Stocks – give important insights into U.S. crop supply at telling points during the year. Currently, NASS is conducting the June Agricultural and Grain Stocks surveys and asking more than 100,000 farmers, ranchers, and grain storage operators to report actual planted acreage and stocks for use in determining domestic consumption and trade. Survey , combined with information from geospatial, field level yield surveys, weather, and other sources, form the final NASS estimates. In addition to producing high quality statistics about U.S. agriculture, NASS has been helping to establish and improve agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II. Food insecurity, shortfalls in regional food production, and lack of reliable information on the agricultural sector are major concerns in many countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information to address these issues. NASS specialists provide technical assistance and training on a reimbursable basis in all aspects of statistical surveys and systems. The benefits of such assistance and resulting stronger, consistent statistical organizations extend beyond serving the interests of the various countries. By helping other countries improve their agricultural statistics systems, USDA’s ability to assess world food and fiber production is also improved.

"Census and Survey Division Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Farming  Mar 22,  Keep celebrating National Ag Day by getting ready for the Census of Agriculture and make your voice heard! In just a few months, America’s farmers and ranchers will have the opportunity to strongly represent agriculture in their communities and industry by taking part in the Census of Ag. This National Ag Day, we are sharing the three things you can do now to help us in this tremendous endeavor. Only conducted every five years by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), the census captures a complete count of all U.S. farms, ranches, and those who operate them.  Even small plots of land – whether rural or urban – growing fruit, vegetables or some food animals count if $1,000 or more of such products were raised and sold, or normally would have been sold, during the census year. The census helps tell the whole story of U.S. agriculture. The last Census of Agriculture counted more than 2 million farms and ranches in the U.S. spanning over 914 million acres. Without the Census of Agriculture, we would not know that 3.ates – only one percent of our total population – provide food, fuel, and fiber to the nation and others around the world. The Census of Agriculture remains the only source of uniform, comprehensive, and impartial agriculture for every county in the nation. Census results are valuable to those who serve farmers and rural communities, including federal, state and local governments, agribusinesses, trade associations, extension educators, researchers, and farmers and ranchers themselves. Answers to the census can help grow a farm’s future, shape farm programs, and boost services for communities and the industry. Today, National Ag Day, and in the months to follow, we ask you to do three things: 1. Find out more about the Census of Agriculture by visiting www.agcensus.usda.gov; 2. Sign up to be counted in the Census of Agriculture, if you are involved with agriculture and have never participated in the Census before, and 3. Help spread the word so we can get a complete picture of U.S. agriculture. Become a Census of Agriculture Partner! Producers will receive their Census of Agriculture questionnaires this December. They will have the option to complete their form and return it by mail or use the Online Response to Census of Agriculture. Improved this year, the online census form is convenient, dynamic and user-friendly. It is accessible on any electronic device, calculates totals automatically, and skips questions that do not pertain to the operation. Remember, the Census of Agriculture is Your Voice, Your Future, Your Opportunity.

"NASS Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  May 24,  Fire up the grill for National Barbecue Month. The United States is the largest producer of beef in the world. (Stock photo) With summer right around the corner, it’s time to break out the grill and cornhole – May is National Barbecue Month! It’s also national beef, egg, strawberry, and salad month. Apropos of a backyard shindig, lemonade and apple pie days are also in May. As a matter of fact, the summer months coincide with the peak of several fruits and vegetables, nearly all perfect for a barbecue. Often the star of a barbecue, beef provides options like hamburgers, all beef hotdogs, steak, ribs, kebabs, and brisket. Did you know that the United States produced more than 26 billion pounds of beef last year? For more information about red meat production in , check out the complete Annual Summary (, 1.6 ) released by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) last month. According to the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), the United States is the largest producer of beef in the world! The Census of Agriculture tells us that there are more than 913,000 U.S. farms with cattle and calves. Texas has the largest number of cattle and cattle operations in the country. What will the Census of Agriculture tell us? If beef is on the menu, consider marinating the meat and/or grilling with charcoal or wood chips for added flavor. If you’re making kebabs, don’t forget to soak your wooden skewers in cold water for several minutes before using them to avoid burning. Looking for a couple of great side dishes that are waist wise? Try deviled eggs and a refreshing fruit salad. According to the Chickens and Eggs Summary (, 1.3 ) released in February, U.S. farmers produced 106 billion eggs, 92 billion of which were table eggs, with Iowa being the largest producer. According to the Census of Agriculture, the United States has 198,272 farms with laying hens. Texas has the most operations with layers . Strawberries are great in almost everything! From desserts and drinks to salads and sauces, the strawberry is a nutritious and versatile fruit. In , the U.S. produced more than 3 billion pounds of strawberries. California’s operations, with 38,200 total strawberry acres harvested, produced nearly all the U.S. total with 2.9 billion pounds. For more on strawberries, keep an eye out for the upcoming Noncitrus Fruit and Nuts Annual Report on June 26. Not a big fan of all the work or cleanup of a barbecue? Keep it simple! Organize a potluck and use recyclable or compostable plates and utensils. As for the grill, remove debris while it’s still hot for easier and quicker cleaning. Want to do something creative?

"NRCS Alaska in  Conservation  Forestry  May 11,  Newly hatched salmon. What do wild Alaskan salmon and Sitka black-tailed deer have in common? Other than playing starring roles on many Alaskans’ favorite dinner menus, they also both thrive in forests with large open canopies of hardwood and conifers with thick plant undergrowth. Such characteristics exist in mature forests but not in clear-cut areas. Historically rich in fish and wildlife species, the Starrigavan Creek watershed in Sitka, Alaska, was clear-cut about 40 years ago by the state of Alaska for timber production, impacting fish and wildlife habitat in this popular local recreation area. In , USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) partnered with the U.S. Forest Service, the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Trout Unlimited and the Sitka Conservation Society to rehabilitate the Starrigavan Creek watershed. The goal was to improve habitat for salmon and deer, two keystone species for many watersheds in southeast Alaska that are also important for subsistence and recreation. Secondary goals were to increase berry production and provide firewood for the local community. The forest after thinning. While the Forest Service spearheaded in-stream work on their property, NRCS worked with Trout Unlimited on the adjacent land. We cut excess conifer trees, leaving hardwoods in place to mimic an old growth forest. The hardwoods provide canopy and leaf litter, an important nutrient input to streams and forest soils. To facilitate decomposition of the cut trees, make travel easier for wildlife and allow additional light to reach the understory, we lopped the cut trees into small pieces. Along the roadsides, community members collected the cut trees for firewood. Monitoring the success of the project continues, as there are both short and long-term benefits of forest conservation. The trees left uncut during the project work will grow faster now that they have better access to light, water and nutrients. So far, the newly opened forest floor is thriving with favored deer browse such as bunchberry dogwood and five-leaf bramble; salmon habitat has improved; and the berry picking looks promising.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack in  Forestry  Dec 17,   I want to thank Avoided Deforestation Partners for holding this event and inviting me to join all of the distinguished speakers here today in urging the adoption of REDD plus as part of a global climate framework. We are encouraged by the progress being made here in moving REDD forward.  The United States believes an agreed outcome in Copenhagen should include REDD.  Our negotiating team is working hard to make this happen. Protecting the world’s forests is not a luxury.  It is a necessity. Tropical rainforests, in particular, are of special importance. These forests are vital to the protection and storage of water.  The forests of the Amazon alone provide 15%-20% of the water that flows from the world’s rivers into our oceans. Tropical rainforests are also reservoirs of biodiversity, covering 2% of the world’s surface but containing half of the world’s plants and animals. And, tropical rainforests are vitally important to the livelihood of many living in the world’s rural areas. By creating well-designed policies that value those forests, local people and communities can share in the economic benefits of forest conservation and environmental stewardship. As evidenced by the gathering here in Copenhagen, protecting the world’s climate is one of the greatest challenges of our lifetime.  Forests have a vital role to play in overcoming this challenge.  Rainforests store vast amounts of carbon.  That’s true across the planet, and in America, too.  Our Tongass National Forest, a temperate Alaskan rainforest comprises only 2% of America’s forest land base, but may hold as much as 8% of all the carbon contained in the forests of the United States. Beyond the negative consequences of deforestation, it will be very difficult to protect the world’s climate, without protecting and restoring our forests. We lose more than 13 million hectares of tropical forests annually, and as we’ve heard today, the consequences are enormous, approximately 17% of global warming emissions coming from deforestation. Protecting the world’s forests will require significant capital.  We believe that valuing carbon in forests through a well-designed carbon market can provide one of the best opportunities we have to dramatically slow down forest loss and degradation in developing countries.  Of course, capital alone isn’t enough.  We must develop accurate forest inventories.  We must learn to balance local development with forest conservation.  And we must build local capacity so that countries are ready to participate in REDD markets and activities. The Obama Administration and United States is committed to working with our international partners to protect these forests across the globe.  Today the State Department¸ USAID, and USDA’s Forest Service are already working with the governments of Ghana, Nepal, Mexico and others to learn how REDD plus can be implemented on the ground and we expect to ramp up these programs in the near future.  This includes improvements in carbon inventories, systems for paying for ecosystem services, and assistance in helping forests adapt to a changing climate. While REDD can make it possible for developing countries to protect their forests, developed countries must also recognize their own responsibility towards their own lands.  In the United States, the Obama Administration is taking steps to protect and restore our forests in order to sustain our climate and our water resources.  This week, the US Forest Service will formally announce a process for development of a new forest planning rule to govern the way we manage our publicly-owned National Forests, all 193 million acres.  Moving forward, forest restoration, climate mitigation and adaption will be central components of how we manage our National Forests. The Obama Administration has also taken steps to protect roadless areas on our National Forests – these areas not only store carbon, but are critical in conserving water and wildlife.  And, we recognize the importance of protecting our privately-owned forests many of which are threatened by suburbanization and fragmentation. Our domestic efforts are important, but internationally we must move quickly to make it possible for developing countries to address deforestation.  We recognize the significant role that international public finance must play in supporting developing countries efforts to slow, halt and reverse deforestation.  That’s why I’m pleased to announce that the United States is committing one billion dollars over the next three years for fast start of REDD.  We regard this as an initial investment to build the capacity in these countries and undertake efforts to slow deforestation.  These funds will be available for countries that develop ambitious REDD-plus plans addressing deforestation and forest degradation, according to their respective capabilities.  We encourage other donors to join us in supporting forest countries to ensure early action on REDD-plus becomes a reality. The United States is committed to protecting and restoring its forests as well as helping our international partners do the same.  It is imperative that we sustain our forests everywhere so that they, in turn, can sustain us.

"USDA Grant to Enhance Sustainability of Beginning farmers and Ranchers  One of our biggest opportunities to increase employment and income in rural America is to enhance the sustainability of beginning farmers.  Many farmers are retiring, and coupled with a renewed interest in local foods is causing an increased demand on small and medium-sized farmers. Nearly 25 percent of U.S. farmers are 65 years and older.  The average age of the farm operator is 57 years.  I have noticed a shift is occurring with an increase in the number of new farm operations with many Americans interested in becoming beginning farmers and ranchers.  However, these farmers face unique challenges, including rising cost of farm land, lack of knowledge about accessing farm land and the capital to buy the land, lack of training in sustainable farming practices, a lack of operating capital in their initial years, and many need experiential learning to be successful.

"NRCS National Agricultural Engineer and USDA People’s Garden Apiary Co-Beekeeper in  Conservation  Initiatives  Sep 03,   This story has three parts. Read Part 1 here. Read Part 2 here. For an hour or so, that’s how it went: on one side of the roof, I smoked the bees and removed capped frames, volunteers ran the capped frames over to the extractor on the other side of the roof, and the extractor team spun the honey out of the trays with the hand-cranked extractor. The centrifuged honey slid down the sides of the extractor into a sweet puddle at the bottom of the metal barrel. Everyone had a turn spinning the extractor (and maybe sneaking a taste of the fresh honey; but I can’t say for sure—I was on the other side of the roof).  Then the extractor broke! A couple of the teeth in the gear snapped off, making it impossible to turn the hand crank. Andy and Nathan decided to carry the extractor and the remaining full frames back to their office in Beltsville, Maryland, where they had another extractor and could finish the job. But first, we wanted to pour the first two jars of honey. At the bottom of the exterior of the extractor barrel was a small tap. Leslie handed me two jars and I tapped the beautiful, clear honey into the jars. It was a proud moment for all of us.  This is me with the first two bottles from the extractor. From now on we’ll be able to monitor the hive for when the frames are full—and thus determine a good time to harvest the honey—without disturbing the bees. That’s because, while we were in the middle of the honey harvest, we lifted the hive and placed a scale under it. The scale has a logger that will take readings of the hive every 10 minutes to evaluate weight gain and loss. So we’ll now know how much honey is in the hive without even cracking the lid.  This is the bottom of the hive resting on the scale, which has been set on top of cinderblocks.  In case you’re curious, we didn’t take all of the hive’s honey that day. We left the bees several partially full frames to build on. They feed the young that honey, and we didn’t want to make more work for them than we had to. After all, it’s hot out, and gathering nectar to make honey is hard work. And after Nathan and Andy finished putting all the honey in jars, they put the extractor, with its streaks of honey, back on the roof for the bees to harvest. Now that’s what I call recycling!  For the latest updates, follow the People's Garden, NRCS and ARS on Twitter.

"Public Affairs Specialist, NRCS in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 23,  Glynis Coleman and her son sell peppers and berries at a KYF2 Conference at the Kerr Center in Oklahoma. Larry Wright leaned to his right and said, “I just realized that when I was up there introducing the conference, I forgot to tell everyone who I was.”Larry is the Oklahoma area coordinator for the Great Plains Resource Conservation and Development’s (RC&D) and worked tirelessly for five months planning a conference that would help build the rural communities his council serves.  After his first Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Conference and Gala more than 250 attendees know exactly what Larry does, and will be telling their friends about him, too. The event was organized to help farmers and landowners learn about the opportunities offered by local and regional markets, and how USDA can help communities develop local and regional food systems.  It also brought together staff from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Cooperative Extension, and other agencies to meet and learn about producers and each other. The sessions for the conference moved from more topical content, like getting started with organic gardening, to more specific topics for those needing something more in-depth, like third-party verification.  You could tell by the questions asked that this conference met the aim of serving a range of people, including producers, aggregators, farmer’s market organizers, and school nutrition professionals. Some of the attendees were like Glynis Coleman.  She is a small scale producer originally from Denver, Colorado.  As a child, her only exposure to agriculture was through her grandmother’s small garden.  In the last few years, family obligations made it necessary for her to find some way to make money working from home.  A former nurse armed only with a small acreage and the ability to keep house plants alive, she set out in search of knowledge that would make agriculture a viable option for her.  Her first stop was a conference held by the Kerr Center. At the conference, Coleman and her son placed generously filled pint-sized baskets of black berries and peppers next to Melvett Chambers’ tomatoes in a miniature farmer’s market stand set up in the foyer.  After Chambers told her the price of small and large fruits, Coleman suggested the entire crop seemed to be abundantly sized when she asked with disbelief, “Which are the small?” It is one of many questions she has asked Chambers over her four years in the business.  Chris Kirby, with the Oklahoma Farm to School Program, matched them up in a sort of unofficial mentorship.  Coleman was not at the conference only to sell produce.  She also attended the plasticulture session, an agricultural system she already uses, and learned more about expanding her operation through the NRCS Environmental Quality Incentives Program Organic Initiative. Coleman says that there have been a few set-backs for her business, but she has been successful enough that her sister has left a career in the construction industry to add chickens and possibly goats to the operation.  For beginning farmers, Coleman says conferences like this are a good place to begin gathering information.  She offers this advice, “Make sure you want to do this, it is hard work.  Be willing to make mistakes. Diversify your crops.  You become reliant on the weather and God so you have to have some faith.” The conference exceeded everyone’s expectations.  Larry Wright was asked by many of the excited attendees if there will be another conference next year.  “There will be a conference for as long as it is needed.” (You can learn more about the Great Plains RC&D council and keep an eye out for next year’s conference and other events online at:   Category/Topic:  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Tags:  CEQ  Great Plains Resource Conservation and Development’s (RC&D)  KYF2  Natural Resources Conservation Service  Oklahoma Farm to School Program","What advice does Glynis Coleman, a small-scale producer, give to beginning farmers regarding building a successful farm business?","Glynis Coleman advises beginning farmers to ""Make sure you want to do this, it's hard work.

"Nebraska National Forests, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 27,  Richard Gilbert, Bessey Nursery Manager talks with students from Sandhills Public Schools about the seed collection process, growing process and replanting. (U.S. Forest Service/Tim Buskirk) Two million seedlings will grow up one day to become the forests of our future. The vision for all of those trees is part of the mission of the Charles E. Bessey Nursery, part of the Nebraska National Forests and Grasslands, and the oldest federal seedling nursery in the nation. Working with the Bessey Ranger District and the volunteer group Friends of the Nebraska National Forests, the nursery recently invited the public in for a rare opportunity to see the nursery in full production; growing, packing and shipping hundreds of thousands of seedlings to U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, conservation districts and other government agency locations. The seedlings are used for reforestation following fire and insect infestations, wildlife/habitat plantings, wind breaks, conservation plantings, and general planting. “We’ve just shipped 150,000 container seedlings of Douglas-Fir and Ponderosa Pine to the site of the Hayman fire on the Pike San Isabel National Forests in Colorado,"" says Richard Gilbert, the nursery manager. “These seedlings were grown from cones gathered by forest personnel near Colorado Springs and sent to us for extraction and storage until they are needed. The seedlings were started in February , packed once they were dormant in November , stored in a freezer at 26 degrees, and today we are ready to return them home. It’s gratifying to know we play a part in preserving the natural integrity of our nation’s forests.” According to Gilbert, in addition to the Hayman fire site, another 136,000 container seedlings were shipped to the Pike San Isabel National Forests. Almost 2.3 million seedlings were shipped for spring planting to forests in the Rocky Mountain Region and state agencies including the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest, the Nebraska National Forests,  Grand Mesa, Umcompahgre National Forest , Kansas Forest Service, White River National Forest, Black Hills National Forest and the San Juan National Forest Additional seedlings were sent to Conservation Districts in South Dakota and North Dakota and 1 million went to the Natural Resource Districts of Nebraska.  Large trees were shipped to the Memorial Grove near Monument, Colorado. “It was exciting to have so many students,” said Tim Buskirk, Bessey District ranger. “It was an honor to introduce them to the rich history of Bessey and the unique hand-planted forest. I hope many of them come back with their families soon.” The event also celebrated the kick-off of a new, accessible Discovery Loup Trail to loop through the Bessey Arboretum, conveniently located near the Bessey Visitor Center and Nursery. The three-quarter mile trail will be completed by Friends of the Nebraska National Forests, working together with the Bessey staff. According to volunteer Pam Reed, Nebraska master naturalist, the project involves renovation to a portion of the Bessey Arboretum, new tree identification markers for the 65 tree species located there, interpretive exhibits and a kiosk. Educational materials will showcase this unique Nebraska ecosystem, and the experimental, hand-planted forest and federal nursery.

"USDA Office of Tribal Relations in  Conservation  Energy  Food and Nutrition  Rural  Dec 15,   was another banner year for innovative Federal / Tribal partnerships, government-to-government relations with Federally Recognized Tribes and investments that continue to improve the quality of life for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Here are five examples from this past year of ways USDA and this Administration have built on their deep commitment to improving our working relationships with Tribes and helping them meet unique challenges facing tribal communities head-on. 1.

Sowing Gardens, and Growing Kids Who Love Them If you ever bought into the idea that “kids don’t like vegetables,” elementary schoolers at Cherokee Central Schools’ in North Carolina could have changed your mind that day. Stationed in front of the school during after-school pick-up time, every car and person within reach received a glowing description of the wondrous greens the students helped grow, the most popular being a local native variety called Creasy Greens. Cherokee Central Schools students participate in a hands-on lesson in the school’s garden, which is planted with traditional varieties of vegetables grown for generations by the Cherokee people. 3. Investing in Opportunity in Indian Country Investments in strong, secure infrastructure in Indian Country—things like roads and bridges, but also internet access, housing and community facilities like hospitals and schools—help to improve connectivity and access to information, move products to market, and make communities competitive and attractive to businesses and investments.

"USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Dec 15,   Day and night, pollinators are at work all around us—and it's not just honey bees. Did you know that pollinators are responsible for one out of three bites of food we eat? If you'd like to learn more, we've pulled together five blogs from highlighting some surprising facts about these busy helpers and the many ways different USDA agencies, farmers, ranchers and other partners are working to keep all pollinators healthy. 1. Cattle and Honey Bees Graze in Harmony on Wisconsin Farm When USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) launched a new coordinated effort to improve honey bee habitat in , Fitton was one of the first to participate. He works closely with NRCS to make improvements to the land that provide better forage for his cattle, improve existing hayfields and convert former corn fields into healthy pasture. Reed Fitton has enhanced honey bee habitat on the pastures he manages near Gays Mills, Wisconsin. 2. A Diet to Help Conserve Bees When Food Is Scarce In exchange for their labor, flowers provide bees with pollen and nectar as food. But few people wonder what’s available for bees to eat when there are few plants blooming in the late fall and early winter. MegaBee, an artificial diet developed by ARS and S.A.F.E. R&D, LLC, helps sustain honey bees in the face of pressures such as poor nutrition, pathogens, parasites and sublethal exposure to pesticides. 3. Using Agroforestry to Help Pollinators Help You One question many people are asking is: how can we incorporate more pollinator habitat into our communities, agricultural lands, and forests? Ongoing research by the U.S. Forest Service demonstrates that the number of pollinators in our landscapes can be increased through agroforestry and other land management practices. Blueberry bushes provide food for both bumblebees and people. (Photo credit: Nancy Adamson/ National Agroforestry Center.) 4. NRCS Partners with Farmers, Ranchers to Aid Monarch Butterflies Because monarch butterflies are often on the move, they need to have the right plants at the right time along their migration route, including milkweed, which is the sole food source for monarch caterpillars. We worked with butterfly experts across the United States to choose the best plant species for monarchs based on geographic location and value to monarchs. NRCS is working with farmers and ranchers to create and enhance habitat for monarchs. NRCS photo by Gene Barickman. 5. Celebrate the Mysterious World of Caves, a Home for Bats during International Bat Week Bats are vital to the health of our environment and economy.

"NIFA Public Affairs in  Research and Science  Dec 15,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. As we look back on , NIFA is also celebrating the partnership we have developed with the nation’s land-grant universities (LGUs), who play a critical role teaching students to meet the high quality, innovative research needs that are vital to the production of our country’s food, fuel, and fiber. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture provides support to historically black colleges and universities that were designated at as LGUs in the Second Morrill Act in .  Grants to these universities support research, extension, and teaching in the food and agricultural sciences by building the institutional capacities of these schools.  Looking back on , here are 5 highlights. 1. s land-grant universities: Providing access and enhancing opportunities Historically black land-grant universities celebrated the 125th anniversary of the Second Morrill Act in August .  There are 19 land-grant universities in 18 states, including Central State University in Ohio, which as established under the Farm Bill.  USDA’s  National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers a number of LGU education grant programs that support projects that strengthen teaching, research, Extension, and facility programs in the food and agricultural sciences.

That changed quickly, however, at one of the foremost agricultural schools in the country, Tuskegee University, where she said, many people “helped me, guided me, and cared about my success.”  Today, Brooks has a Ph.D. in microbiology and is a leader in the Land-Grant University (LGU) System as the Executive Director of the Association of Research Directors. Dr. Carolyn Brooks had little exposure to agriculture while growing up in the city but, thanks to a love for biology nurtured at a ’s Land Grant University, she knows plenty now and even served as dean of the School of Agricultural and Natural Sciences at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore, MD.

Alston’s DNA; he’s a third generation LGU agricultural scholar whose passion for giving back led to the creation of a program that provides students access to educational tools that weren’t accessible before.  While drafting his version of the perfect curriculum, he encountered students who lacked transferable credits from their two-year degree programs.  Alston wanted them to have the opportunity, so he developed the “2+2: Online Studies program.” Dr. Antoine Alston is professor and associate dean for academic studies in North Carolina A&T State University’s School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences. He is a nationally recognized student mentor, agricultural educator, and expert in the areas of diversity and inclusion. (Photo courtesy of Antoine Alston) 4. Second Morrill Act redux: America’s land-grant universities academic par excellence Booker T. Washington.  George Washington Carver.  Educators par excellence.  Pioneers in food and agricultural scientific research. Dedicated their lives to helping “lift the veil of ignorance” by bringing knowledge to African-Americans and others with limited resources.  In the 125th year of their founding the family of LGUs, which includes 19 institutions in 18 states, continues its legacy of innovations; examples of recent innovations are cited. USDA joins everyone celebrating 125 years of the Second Morrill Act, which has provided educational opportunities for all. 5. There’s something fishy going on in Petersburg’s food desert In the midst of a food desert, Virginia State University (VSU) Cooperative Extension is teaching students how to create and operate sustainable urban farming, and helping feed the community while they’re doing it.  VSU purchased a large empty warehouse in downtown Petersburg and converted it into an aquaponics production center where they raise fish and grow plants in nutrient-rich water.  The indoor urban farm produces vegetables, herbs, and protein year-round and with a minimal environmental footprint. Virginia State University used a NIFA grant to purchase facilities where they teach aquaponics and urban farming. The operation allows them to both raise fish and grow vegetables in a symbiotic environment.

"Posted by Doug O’Brien, Deputy Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Apr 21,  The future of rural communities depends on safe, clean water supplies and healthy watersheds. That future is being challenged like never before and USDA RD is helping them meet the challenge. With Earth Day on the horizon for tomorrow, we at USDA Rural Development are looking forward to sharing some very big news about efforts kicking off across the nation to ensure clean drinking water and healthy watersheds in small, rural communities that face increasing challenges with aging infrastructure, drought and climate change. As you probably know, Rural Development works hard to help rural communities plan and build the critical infrastructure they need to grow and prosper sustainably. Over the past five years, in fact, Rural Development has invested nearly $10.3 billion through 7,867 loans, loan guarantees, and grants for rural drinking water and wastewater treatment upgrades across the nation. Collectively, this work generates powerful environmental benefits. Individually, each project demonstrates how even the smallest community -- and the everyday people living there -- can accomplish the substantial and vitally important work of preserving and protecting our natural resources and quality of life for future generations. With an infusion of funding provided by Congress in the Agricultural Act (Farm Bill) and to our local USDA Rural Development’s speedy delivery of those resources, small towns across the country will kick off a record number of water and wastewater system improvements beginning on Earth Day. Stay tuned this week to learn more about Rural Development’s largest-ever Earth Day commitment and the communities taking action for a sustainable future.

Title II—Public Accommodations Outlawed discrimination in hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, and all other public accommodations engaged in interstate commerce. Title III—Desegregation of Public Facilities Permitted Justice Department suits to secure desegregation of certain public facilities. Title IV—Desegregation of Public Education Encouraged the desegregation of public schools and authorized the U. S. Attorney General to file suits to force desegregation. Title V—Civil Rights Commission Addressed procedures for the Commission, broadened its duties. Title VI—Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs Authorized but did not require withdrawal of federal funds from programs which practiced discrimination. Title VII—Equal Employment Opportunity Outlawed discrimination in employment in any business exceeding twenty five people and creates an Equal Employment Opportunities Commission to review complaints. Title VIII—Registration and Voting Statistics Directed the Census Bureau to collect registration and voting statistics based on race, color and national origin. Title IX—Intervention and Removal of Cases Made reviewable in high federal courts the action of federal district courts in remanding a civil rights case to state court and authorized the Attorney General to intervene in certain private suits. Title X—Community Relations Service Created the Service to aid communities in resolving disputes relating to discriminatory practices based on race, color, or national origin. Title XI—Miscellaneous* Born in rural Alabama, General Williams spoke of the long road to passage of the Act, and how he lived “through quite a bit of the struggle”.  He discussed the segregated Alabama school system, reading ‘handed down’ school books, riding in the back of a public bus from his town to attend college, and how, after joining the military, he was pulled over by vigilantes while driving. “These are memories you can never forget, but it made me stronger; a better person and things changed with time.” He said life in America is like a cafeteria: you can pick what you want, but at the end you have to pay a price.  “We are still coming together.” In conclusion, Deputy Assistant Secretary Shorter said that the Act “Gave me a chance for an education and is the beginning of the now-modern America.  It set the stage and we must celebrate what happened, but it is also a call for us to keep pushing forward and treating others as we would want to be treated.  Now go out and BE better.” *SOURCE: Congress and the Nation, -64 (Congressional Service, ): -41.

"Communications Director, USDA Rural Development, Tennessee in  Energy  Rural  Feb 01,   USDA Business and Cooperative Programs Administrator Judith Canales convened a roundtable of renewable energy experts from the southeast in Nashville on January 26, to discuss development and marketing of bioenergy technologies and advanced biofuels. Despite an unexpected snow the night before, participants traveled in from Memphis and Knoxville as well as Middle Tennessee. FSA and Rural Development State Directors Gene Davidson and Bobby Goode hosted the Administrator and Ed Harlan of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Louis Buck of Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative, Pete Nelson of Memphis Bioworks, Atha Comiskey and Bart Comiskey of Clean Cities of Middle Tennessee, Paul Melgaard of Eco Energy, Terry Ruse of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Warren Nevad of the Tennessee Renewable Energy Economic Council, Dan Stasser of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Stan Boyd and David Owenby of the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Rural Development Tennessee Energy Programs Coordinator Will Dodson. Canales opened the forum with the idea that, ""By making renewable energy sources commercially viable based on feed stock available in each region of the country, we create sustainable opportunities for job creation and economic development, and keep more energy dollars in the community."" The spirited discussion covered a range of challenges on the horizon for the emerging bioenergy industry from traditional fuel providers to misperceptions about the tradeoff between food and fuel crops. Canales emphasized that changes are coming to the USDA energy programs that will allow applications to be submitted year round and to encourage geographic and technological diversity. Canales and others brought up the regional nature of biofuel production. Regionally significant feed stocks mentioned included cellulosic switch grass, wood pulp and sucrose-rich crops. With the commercial availability of existing flex fuels growing rapidly, participants called for a fresh examination of regulations intended to encourage their use. ""Greater use helps drive down production costs and will encourage more stations to carry fuels like E20, E30 and E85 as they come online,"" said Goode. ""We can help drive the change to cleaner fuels by doing more to take advantage of flex fuels in fleet vehicles and by educating consumers on the benefits of using more renewable American-made energy resources."" Coop Manager Louis Buck said that with the advances being made in bioenergy production today he looks forward to a time when farmers send power down wires to the city and get a check delivered back in the mail. Electronic mail, presumably. During the roundtable, Canales also announced the award of a $25,000 Rural Energy for America (REAP) grant to the Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative. According to Buck, ""The investment will be used for research into commercializing a new, more efficient technology for generating hydrogen from what is typically regarded as low-potential biomass feed stock.""

Since USDA has provided support for more than 3,300 educational institutions receiving distance learning services to help rural children get an education that is as good as that of their peers in cities.Today's investments are being provided through USDA's Distance Learning and Telemedicine Loan and Grant program. It provides funding to rural hospitals, clinics, schools and libraries for equipment and technical assistance for telemedicine and distance learning. Grant recipients must demonstrate that they serve rural America, prove there is an economic need and provide at least 15 percent in matching funds.For example, the South Central Ohio Computer Association in Piketon, Ohio, has been selected for a $184,000 grant to link 20 high schools. The Association will train students for high technology careers through a mentoring program using advanced communications technology. In Idaho, funds will be used by the Idaho Education Network to purchase distance learning equipment for K-8 schools in 62 of Idaho's most rural and economically challenged communities. The distance learning equipment will also be used to train emergency service personnel after school hours.Since , USDA has invested almost $150 million in the Distance Learning and Telemedicine program. These investments complement other USDA efforts to improve rural communications. In , USDA provided $305 million in loans for broadband infrastructure. These loans will result in new or upgraded broadband service for about 120,000 rural households, businesses and community institutions once the projects are completed.

"Farm Service Agency Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 29,  During a lunch-hour cooking demonstration with chef Jonathan Bardzik (left), Farm Service Agency (FSA) Administrator Val Dolcini (right) explains how FSA helps growers move produce from farm to market to the consumer’s table. During my travels to 46 states over the past two years, I’ve explored Illinois cornfields, watched an oyster harvest in Connecticut, and admired beet fields in North Dakota. I’ve toured a rooftop farm on a Brooklyn high-rise, and marveled at fresh vegetables grown in truck containers in the remote Alaskan Arctic. These are the places where it all begins, so that Americans have safe and affordable food, from the farm to the plate. So when local author and chef Jonathan Bardzik invited me to the USDA cafeteria for a lunch-hour cooking demonstration, I grabbed my apron and joined him as his “Sous Chef for the Day.” Bardzik has created more than 600 recipes using fresh produce from local farmers markets. With an audience of the USDA workforce and even tourists visiting from the National Mall, we prepared a delicious menu of minestrone pasta, eggplant and tomato soup, green beans with pistou sauce, and mesclun with honey crisp apples and cider vinaigrette. While cooking, we discussed how FSA provides a critical financial safety net for farmers and ranchers that ensures what they produce reaches the marketplace and ultimately to the table. I highlighted how the workhorse of the FSA portfolio, our microloan, of which 25,000 have been issued in just three years, has been a real game changer for farmers and ranchers, especially those who participate in farmers markets, urban agriculture, or as suppliers of locally sourced food. We also discussed the FSA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), which, by helping farmers replace environmentally sensitive farmland with grasses, shrubs and trees, has done tremendous work to enhance air and water quality, prevent soil erosion, and create habitat for waterfowl, wetland and upland species. It wasn’t long before our guests attending our cooking demonstration were able to try all four of our freshly prepared recipes – with the Chef even offering cards so that guests could recreate the recipes in their own kitchens. And with my mini-apprenticeship drawing to a close, I thanked Chef Bardzik for the opportunity to join him in our own “farm-to-plate” adventure here at USDA.

"FSA Public Affairs Specialist in  Forestry  Conservation  Oct 03,  Fires blaze from the Blacktail Fire, located in the Blacktail Creek area, east of Loco Mountain in the Crazy Mountains, in Montana. The Blacktail Fire engulfed a little over 5,000 acres, with over 1 million acres impacted across Montana through various wildfires. Dry conditions plagued Montana this summer, with multiple wildfires torching over 1 million acres throughout the state. The largest fire, the Lodgepole Complex fire, impacted over 270,000 acres. Recent rain and snow, and the forecast for continued precipitation, help to suppress the fires and provide welcome relief for Montana residents. Fires aren’t too uncommon in Montana, but this year’s fire season has been different. Spring brought plenty of moisture from an abundant snow-pack and provided adequate moisture for grass growth. The moisture quickly depleting leaving most of the state in drought condition. “Ranchers saw this as great grass and feed. Firefighters saw it as fuel,” said Dennis Garcia, Farm Service Agency (FSA) county executive director for Glacier County, Montana. Garcia was activated to serve in the National Guard during the wildfire suppression efforts near Lolo, Montana. FSA provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have been impacted by natural disasters, including wildfires, by administering a suite of safety-net programs to help producers recover from eligible losses, such as the Livestock Indemnity Program, the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program, and the Tree Assistance Program. The programs can assist farmers and ranchers who lost livestock, grazing land, fences or eligible trees, bushes and vines as a result of the qualifying natural disaster. In addition, the FSA Emergency Conservation Program provides funding and technical assistance for farmers and ranchers to rehabilitate farmland damaged by natural disasters. Low-interest emergency loans are available to help producers recover from production and physical losses. Compensation is also available to producers who purchased coverage through the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, which protects non-insurable crops (including native grass for grazing) against natural disasters that result in lower yields, crop losses or prevented planting. As a result of the ongoing drought conditions, all Montana counties were approved for emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) acres. Due to drought and fire conditions, 53 of the state’s 56 counties have been declared either primary or contiguous disaster areas. “The short term impact is FSA can do a lot of good for producers. Producers can get some relief, fix fences and get feed purchased,” Garcia said. Garcia said hay donations came into the state from other areas to help out ranchers in need. Additionally, FSA employees from other states, including Missouri and Oklahoma, have spent time helping Montana producers enroll in FSA disaster programs. “It is proof that the agriculture community is one big small town where you have a lot of folks that have camaraderie,” he said. Detailed information on all of these disaster assistance programs can be found online at: www.fsa.usda.gov/disaster. Or at the USDA Disaster Resource Center.

"Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative Coordinator, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 03,  Lesser prairie-chickens benefit from lands where a rancher is using prescribed grazing, according to a new report. Photo courtesy of Nick Richter. Habitat conservation practices make a difference for lesser prairie-chickens. That's the finding of a recent scientific study – the first part of a multi-year study – described in a new report from the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative (LPCI). LPCI, led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), works with partner organizations and ranchers to improve habitat and address threats to the bird. Since , more than 1 million acres of habitat have been restored on working lands. NRCS works with partners to monitor the outcomes, which helps determine if conservation practices are making a difference, but accurately estimating wildlife populations can be challenging with uncommon, widely dispersed species like the lesser prairie-chicken. A recent study identified a new model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, and it shows encouraging evidence that NRCS-recommended conservation practices through LPCI are working and that large blocks of intact prairie are important to prairie-chicken conservation. The study assessed one year of from the annual aerial survey of lesser prairie-chicken lek sites conducted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and it looked at four factors that might impact site occupancy — patch size of native vegetation, percent of land cover managed with prescribed grazing; percent of land cover enrolled in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and density of primary roads. The research team intends to continue with a multi-year study that assesses additional variables. As the amount of land enrolled in CRP or using prescribed grazing increases, the likelihood that lesser prairie-chickens will occupy that land also increases. Lesser prairie-chickens face many threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation from row-crop agriculture, fire suppression, unmanaged grazing, development, and drought. The species currently occupies just 16 percent of its historic range. But in western Kansas, lesser prairie-chickens have reoccupied portions of their historical range and have even moved into areas outside that historical range. The range expansion coincides with former croplands enrolled and maintained as grasslands through CRP as well as native grasslands managed using LPCI prescribed grazing practices. A team of researchers tested whether there was a quantifiable link between land where ranchers are implementing LPCI prescribed grazing plans or have enrolled their land in CRP and the likelihood of prairie-chickens occupying a landscape. Their results indicate that these habitat conservation efforts are working. After developing an expanded model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, the team found that occupancy increases as prairie patch-size increases, as well as in landscapes with ongoing conservation practices. Specifically, the results indicate that when ranchers are using prescribed grazing or enrolling land in CRP, the likelihood of lesser prairie-chickens occupying that habitat increases significantly. The report’s management recommendations include: Enrolling acreage within the lesser prairie-chicken active range in prescribed grazing or CRP. Maintaining large blocks of native prairie across the range through sustainable ranching. Identifying potential landscapes with willing landowners to develop conservation easements, particularly if combined with prescribed grazing and other proven habitat conservation practices. Implementing prescribed grazing on dispersed patches throughout large blocks of rangeland. Cultivating diverse stands of CRP-enrolled grasslands that serve as connective tissue to larger patches of native prairie. Retaining CRP acreage as grasslands after contract expiration. NRCS outlined its three-year conservation strategy for lesser prairie-chicken conservation, which encourages adoption of many of the above recommendations on 500,000 additional acres, such as prescribed grazing, using easements to protect key habitat corridors, and providing assistance to convert expiring CRP lands to grazing.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Farm Service Agency - Office of External Affairs in  Conservation  Feb 29,  Gail Dunlap used the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to implement many conservation practices on her land, including restoring nearly seven acres of wetlands on one of her Ohio farms. Since she was a teenager some 60 years ago, Gail Dunlap has played an active role in her family’s seventh generation Ohio farming operation by focusing on ways to continually improve conservation practices and establish a natural and sustainable way of life. “Back then, we were not that many years past the Dust Bowl times and farmers in the area were doing a wonderful job of resting the soil with long rotations,” said Dunlap. “I remember even the weeds seemed to be as beautiful as wildflowers.” However, as the years passed, Dunlap quickly became more concerned about soil erosion issues in the area. Each time she returned home from college she noticed that more land was being tilled and islands of oak trees within the fields were disappearing. In , Dunlap learned about a new Farm Bill program called the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and was excited about how the program could benefit their farms. Her parents agreed. After talking with their local USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA) staff, they discovered that an entire farm could be eligible for the program. CRP is one of the largest private lands programs for conservation used extensively throughout the country to reduce soil erosion, improve water and air quality and provide wildlife habitat. Today, the original Dunlap farm fosters multiple CRP practices, including wetland restoration, timber, prairies, buffer strips, riparian buffers, grass waterways, shallow water areas, tall grass prairies and various wildlife habitat and food plots. Dunlap has dedicated more than 220 acres of her land in Pickaway and Ross counties to conservation. CRP is a voluntary program that allows eligible landowners to receive annual rental payments and cost-share assistance to establish long-term, resource-conserving covers on eligible farmland throughout the duration of their 10-to-15-year contracts. “CRP is a blessing and it has helped me save our family farm by preserving the land and establishing wildlife habitat,” said Dunlap. “This program gave me hope that I would be able to restore my land through conservation practices so I could bring back diverse wildlife and have the opportunity to plant trees again.” Over the years, Dunlap’s CRP practices did indeed expand. Besides improving the soil health, Dunlap noticed an increase in wildlife numbers. It restored diversity to the farm. “The program provided me income and the opportunity to apply restorative methods to save my land and allow wildlife species to return, reproduce and thrive,” said Dunlap. “It has brought back beauty to the landscape, improved soil fertility and created new ecosystems that will continue to improve over the years. The impact of CRP will benefit many future generations.” Since , CRP has helped prevent more than 9 billion tons of soil from eroding and protected more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian and grass buffers, more than 100,000 acres of bottomland hardwood trees, nearly 300,000 acres of flood-plain wetlands, and 250,000 acres each for duck nesting habitat and upland bird habitat.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Jan 06,  A lesser prairie-chicken outfitted with a satellite telemetry harness on its back in CRP grass cover. Photo by Ashley Tanner The lesser prairie-chicken and its habitat are making a comeback thanks to a USDA conservation program. The ground-dwelling bird was once abundant in the southern Great Plains, living in parts of Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. But over the past 150 years due to human migration and settlement, the lesser prairie-chicken population has declined by more than 90 percent, and its range has shrunk by over 80 percent. The main threat facing the lesser prairie-chicken is the loss of habitat needed for survival caused by converting prairie to cropland, livestock overgrazing, oil and gas development, and building roads and power lines. An Oklahoma State University study recently found that land enrolled in the Farm Service Agency’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) improves and increases lesser prairie-chicken habitat by providing large areas of grasslands and grassland connectivity. The birds were found to rarely move more than 0.3 miles to or from roost sites, and at the county scale, the presence of CRP appears to increase habitat suitability and roost-site accessibility. The study was summarized in a recent Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Insight (, 1.2 ). Funded by the NRCS Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) Wildlife Component, the study investigated how CRP acreage influences lesser prairie-chicken habitat suitability and the birds’ use of the land. The researchers placed satellite telemetry harnesses on the backs of 104 lesser prairie-chickens from to throughout Beaver County, Oklahoma, to track how the birds used space and moved about in areas with varying amounts of CRP land. Bird movements were evaluated at the individual pasture, county, and distribution-wide scales. Bird locations were gathered from GPS and citizen science (such as the eBird database) and used to determine habitat suitability at both the distribution-wide and county levels, while GPS locations and bird movement patterns (i.e., movements between consecutive locations) were used to assess space-use in relation to CRP land at the county and pasture levels. The study showed that given the bird’s limited movements, habitat benefits vary according to the spatial arrangement of CRP across the landscape, so a patchwork of CRP, native range, and cropland areas may best provide for the needs of the lesser-prairie chicken. Another encouraging finding is that at the pasture scale, managed grazing of CRP land does not negatively influence the birds’ movements or habitat selection and appears compatible with the conservation objective of providing lesser prairie-chicken habitat. In many ways, ground-dwelling birds are no different than their counterparts that nest in trees, safely above many predators. Like their high-flying relatives, birds that live on the ground need food, water, and shelter for survival. The Oklahoma State University study shows that CRP can help preserve and restore what the lesser prairie-chicken needs to survive and thrive. CRP is one of several USDA programs that USDA offers that can help producers manage for prairie chicken habitat. Producers can learn more by contacting their local Service Center. Signed into law in , CRP is one of the largest private-lands conservation programs in the United States. It was originally intended primarily to control soil erosion and potentially stabilize commodity prices by taking marginal lands out of production. The program has evolved over the years, providing many conservation and economic benefits. The program marks its 35-year anniversary this month.

"Writer-Editor, USDA Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Jun 19,  A bee gathering pollen and nectar from a helianthus flower. Everyone wants healthy, thriving honey bee colonies. One-third of the food we eat requires pollinators, and commercial beekeepers transport honey bees hundreds of miles each year to pollinate almond trees and other crops. A scientist with USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and his colleagues have found that honey bee colonies foraging on land with a strong cover of clover species and alfalfa do more than three times better than colonies put next to crop fields of sunflowers or canola. The study was recently published in Scientific . The scientists placed managed honey bee colonies next to land in the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in North Dakota and let the bees forage from May to October. CRP lands are reserved for long-term conservation efforts and are often home to a wide variety of flowering plants that bees find appealing. The CRP colonies had better health, more bees and greater ability to turn nectar and pollen into vitellogenin—a compound that serves as the base for producing royal jelly, which bees use to nurture larvae and turn larvae into queens. Vitellogenin is also a critical food storage reservoir for honey bees. After spending six months foraging on CRP land and then overwintering, more than 78 percent of the colonies in the study were graded A, the level commanding the highest price for pollination services in January. Of the colonies kept near intensely cultivated fields and then overwintered under the same circumstances as the CRP colonies, only 20 percent could be rated Grade A. “With California almond growers having paid an average of $190 per Grade A colony in the almond pollination season, the need for beekeepers to have access to land that has diverse and substantial nectar and pollen sources is obvious,” explained ARS research microbiologist Kirk E. Anderson. Anderson is with the ARS Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson, Arizona. Anderson and his team, including ARS molecular biologist Vincent Ricigliano, found that greater stores of vitellogenin were the best predictor of colony size after winter. The protein-rich compound prolongs the lifespans of queens and forager bees and strongly influences key behaviors that increase colony survival. This study highlights the value of high-quality forage, such as that provided by CRP land, to honey bee production in the Northern Great Plains region, which hosts close to half the U.S. managed bee population (about 1 million colonies) from May through October.

"Sound and Sensible Initiative Projects Simplify Organic Certification  USDA’s National Organic Program is the bedrock regulatory program responsible for developing national standards for organically-produced agricultural products. These standards assure consumers that products with the USDA organic seal meet consistent, uniform standards. In addition to protecting the integrity of the organic seal through a rigorous certification process and oversight, we are committed to connecting organic farmers and businesses with USDA resources, including conservation assistance, access to loans and grants, funding for organic research and education, and mitigation of pest emergencies. The USDA organic seal and the NOP program itself have helped organic producers and businesses achieve unprecedented levels of growth for organically produced goods. The retail market for organic products has nearly doubled in value since while USDA certified organic operations continue to grow year to year. USDA’s National Organic Program is a leading global standard and major factor in this success.

"Helping Organics Grow with Clear Livestock and Poultry Standards  The mission of the National Organic Program, part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), is to protect the integrity of USDA organic products in our country and throughout the world. This means clearly defining what it means to be organic and enforcing those rules.  Consumers look for and trust the organic seal because they know that USDA stands behind the standards that it represents. Today, USDA is taking action by announcing that we will soon publish and invite public comment on a proposed rule regarding organic livestock and poultry practices.  It’s an important step that will strengthen consumer confidence in the label and ensure that organic agriculture continues to provide economic opportunities for farmers, ranchers, and businesses around the country.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 22,  Understanding the USDA Organic Label  Amidst nutrition facts, ingredient lists, and dietary claims on food packages, “organic” might appear as one more piece of information to decipher when shopping for products.  Understanding what the organic label means can help shoppers make informed purchasing choices. Organic is a labeling term found on products that have been produced using cultural, biological, and mechanical practices that support the cycling of on-farm resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. The National Organic Program – part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service – enforces the organic regulations, ensuring the integrity of the USDA Organic Seal. In order to make an organic claim or use the USDA Organic Seal, the final product must follow strict production, handling and labeling standards and go through the organic certification process.  The standards address a variety of factors such as soil quality, animal raising practices, and pest and weed control.  Synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, irradiation, and genetic engineering may not be used.   Organic producers rely on natural substances and physical, mechanical, or biologically based farming methods to the fullest extent possible.  Organic produce must be grown on soil that had no prohibited substances (most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides) applied for three years prior to harvest.  As for organic meat, the standards require that animals are raised in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors, fed organic feed, and not administered antibiotics or hormones.  There are four distinct labeling categories for organic products – 100 percent organic, organic, “made with” organic ingredients, and specific organic ingredients.   In the “100 Percent Organic” category, products must be made up of 100 percent certified organic ingredients.  The label must include the name of the certifying agent and may include the USDA Organic Seal and/or the 100 percent organic claim.   In the “Organic” category, the product and ingredients must be certified organic, except where specified on National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances.  Non-organic ingredients allowed per the National List may be used, but no more than five percent of the combined total ingredients may contain non-organic content.  Additionally, the label must include the name of the certifying agent, and may include the USDA Organic Seal and/or the organic claim. For multi-ingredient products in the “made with” organic category, at least 70 percent of the product must be certified organic ingredients.  The organic seal cannot be used on the product, and the final product cannot be represented as organic – only up to three ingredients or ingredient categories can be represented as organic.  Any remaining ingredients are not to be organically produced but must be produced without excluded methods (genetic engineering). All non-agricultural products must be allowed on the National List.  For example, processed organic foods may contain some approved non-agricultural ingredients, like enzymes in yogurt, pectin in fruit jams, or baking soda in baked goods. Multi-ingredient products with less than 70 percent certified organic content would fall under the “specific organic ingredients,” and don’t need to be certified. These products cannot display the USDA Organic Seal or use the word organic on the principal display panel.  They can list certified organic ingredients in the ingredient list and the percentage of organic ingredients.  Becoming familiar with organic labeling allows consumers to make informed decisions about the products they purchase.  Consumers can be assured that the integrity of USDA organic products are verified from farm to market.

"Organic 101: The National Organic Standards Board - Representing the Organic Community  From Shayla Bailey, USDA:  This is the twentieth installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. To mark the 20th milestone, USDA invited Dr. Jean Richardson, Chair of the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), to be a guest author. The NOSB provides critical support to the USDA and the organic community.  We thank the NOSB for their commitment to the organic community, and the integrity of the organic label. Twice a year, the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) meets to advise the Secretary of Agriculture on what substances should be allowed or prohibited in organic agriculture.  The NOSB recommends standards, policies and guidance that help shape the organic regulations to the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service. The NOSB was established under the Organic Foods Production Act of , and in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Made up of dedicated volunteers, the 15-member board includes four organic farmers, two handlers, three individuals with expertise in environmental protection or resource conservation, three representatives of public interest or consumer interest groups , a scientist, an organic retailer and an organic certifying agent. Earlier this year, I was honored when my fellow board members elected me as the Chair.
