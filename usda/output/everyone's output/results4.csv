That is the approach that USDA has taken in its partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) National Internship Program. As a current employee with the USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and a former HACU intern, I am glad to help continue this tradition. The HACU National Internship Program helps talented students in more than 400 colleges and universities gain valuable experience through paid internships at federal, private, and non-profit organizations. USDA has been a leading organization working with the program, hosting nearly HACU student interns since . I am part of the nearly 46% of former HACU interns who earned the opportunity to stay on board with the federal government after finishing my degree. I accepted the opportunity to continue my career at the USDA after two eventful summers interning with the AMS Commodity Procurement Program. During my tenure as an intern, I applied what I learned in my education and work experience. My time was spent helping develop and implement a new budget tracking system, overlooking a $2.6 million budget, developing budget procedures, and providing support to the daily branch operations. I also got a chance to help develop and implement a new invoicing process using the new Web Based Supply Chain Management System (WBSCM). The WBSCM is now used by AMS to make purchases for the National School Lunch Program and other federal nutrition assistance programs. As I look back on my experience as a HACU intern working at AMS, I really appreciate the way the program works with USDA and other organizations. After applying for the program through my school, the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla Campus, HACU placed me in an organization and position that matched my educational background. Working with the Commodity Procurement staff turned out to be a great fit for me. AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo with students at the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event. Photo courtesy of Karen Comfort, AMS Special Assistant to the Administrator Looking to the future, I am confident that other HACU interns will have similar experiences at USDA and other partner organizations. I recently had the pleasure of attending the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event where AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo inspired all. She gave the keynote address alongside Principal Deputy Under Secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs Robert L. Jesse. It was great to hear Administrator Alonzo encourage the interns to be fearless as they carve out their career paths. She also stressed that they can achieve anything when they are passionate about the fields they choose. I am glad to hear that my office will be welcoming two talented HACU interns this fall. I am excited to be able to share with them my positive experiences and encourage them to tell others about the program¡¯s success with AMS and other USDA agencies. I know that the internship will place them on track for long, fruitful careers and that they will help others follow in their footsteps.

"PhD, RDN, Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Equity  Mar 27,  USDA is proud to celebrate the second anniversary of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack¡¯s vision to advance food and nutrition security. This first-of-its-kind, whole-of-department approach uses a four-pillar approach, working across USDA¡¯s eight mission areas. These pillars include:  Providing nutrition support from pregnancy to birth and beyond;  Connecting everyone in this country with healthy, safe, affordable foods  Developing, translating, and enacting nutrition science through partnership; and  Prioritizing equity every step of the way. Leveraging the momentum of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, we are also doing our part to implement the National Strategy (, 201 ) on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. This whole-of-society strategy was designed to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. And the Biden-Harris Administration remains focused on the Strategy. At a recent White House event, partners pledged nearly $1.7 billion in new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. Our efforts to advance food and nutrition security also integrates the Secretary¡¯s goal to make MyPlate a household name. As I explain in this video, MyPlate has been our national symbol for healthy eating for more than a decade. MyPlate.gov provides the guidance, tools, and resources that translate the - Dietary into actionable steps anyone can use. We are making our MyPlate materials more culturally, contextually, and linguistically responsive. And we work with more than rategic Partners across a variety of sectors to use common messages to communicate to consumers that it¡¯s never too early or too late to start eating healthy. We even launched a MyPlate Instagram, which is loaded with healthy eating tips and recipes. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack Celebrates Progress on Tackling Food and Nutrition Insecurity As we celebrate the power of nutritious food, we are proud of all we¡¯ve accomplished over the last two years, but we know we can do more and do better, together. Please explore our innovative tools and stay connected. We look forward to working together to help everyone in this country access nutrition education through MyPlate.

Unique Varieties at the Headquarters Garden Written by UW-Madison Department of Horticulture and Seed to Kitchen Collaborative There are many interesting varieties around the Headquarters People¡¯s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Visit the tabs below to learn more.  Plant Breeding 101  Have you ever been to the produce aisle and wondered how there got to be so many different types of lettuce? You might be surprised to learn that broccoli, kale, cabbage, and brussels sprouts all come from the exact same plant species. The incredible diversity of produce we have today has been developed over thousands of years, as plants evolved with and alongside humans. Early farmers and foragers would save seeds from plants that had desirable characteristics ¡ª like big fruits or big leaves, excellent flavor, or the ability to store over the winter¡ª and plant those seeds again in the spring, repeating the process season after season. Today, the science of selecting and reproducing certain plant traits is sometimes known as plant breeding.  There are several different ways of breeding plant varieties:  Open-pollinated varieties are those whose characteristics remain stable across generations. Older varieties, also known as heirlooms, are examples of open-pollinated varieties that can be saved in your garden from season to season. These varieties will continue to display the same characteristics of the previous generation. You can even select seeds with your own ideal traits!  Hybrid varieties are created by cross-pollinating two plants from different inbred lines. To develop hybrid varieties, breeders first take two populations of plants with desirable characteristics and reproduce them until the characteristics are stable. Then, they cross-pollinate the two populations to create an offspring that has the characteristics of both populations. Unlike seeds saved from open-pollinated varieties, seeds saved from hybrids often look very different from the parent plants, and instead display a wide diversity of traits that were present in the original populations.  Genetic engineering allows breeders to change individual traits in plant varieties by editing, inserting, or deleting gene sequences using different molecular techniques. There are not very many crops with genetically engineered varieties on the market today, although many are used in commercial farming of corn, soybeans, cotton, and sugar beets.  There are lots of interesting varieties around the People¡¯s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Scan the QR code on the variety sign to learn more.  Beit Alfa Cucumber  Native to present day India and southern China, the cucumber has been a staple in Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines for thousands of years. Early cucumbers were likely quite bitter due to protective compounds in the cucumber skin which discourage insects and other pests from eating them. Over the years, plant breeders have selected varieties for less bitterness and better flavor, bringing to the table the cucumber we recognize today.  In the s, plant breeder Hanka Lazarson began working on an improved cucumber at the Beit Alfa kibbutz in northern Israel. She started with the local Damascus variety, which ¡°tasted good,¡± but produced cucumbers that were unevenly shaped and sized. So, she set out to develop a variety that was more uniform in appearance. As she worked to identify plants that made right-sized fruits, she realized that the increased uniformity also contributed to better flavor and texture. In a journal entry, she wrote, ¡°Our studies showed that if the cavity space of the cucumber is greater relative to the thickness of the shell. It has a juicier flavor and finer texture.¡±  The kibbutz knew they had a great cucumber on their hands, and in , Lazarson started distributing the seeds of the new variety in the Middle East, and quickly, around the world. Since then, hundreds of heirloom and hybrid varieties have counted Beit Alfa as an ancestor. Of the variety she¡¯d defined, she wrote: ¡°Productive variety, excellent taste and high yield: these indicate the type we called Beit Alfa Cucumber.¡±  Beit Alfa cucumbers are small, sweet, prolific, and can be harvested in short order, usually about 55 days from planting. Commonly referred to as a ¡°burpless¡± variety, Beit Alfas have thin skin, few seeds, and lower levels of cucurbitacin, the compound that made early cucumbers so bitter. They are also adaptable to many different growing environments, making them a popular choice among home gardeners.  Nativity Seeds, ¡°Damascus Cucumber To Beit Alfa Cucumber,¡±   Black Beauty Zucchini  The 20th century was a time of massive growth for the seed industry, which used snappy marketing to promote all types of new and interesting fruit and vegetable varieties. For all the pizzazz, it could be difficult for farmers and home gardeners to determine just which new varieties were actual improvements on the seeds they may have already had. Enter the All-America Selections, which rely on a panel of judges and controlled trials to determine the best new varieties on the market.  Black Beauty Zucchini is one such award winner, crowned in for being one of the earliest-ripening and longest-producing varieties of the dark-skinned zucchinis. Black Beauty was bred by John Scarchuk, a plant breeder at the University of Connecticut. Scarchuk received a degree in botany from UConn and began working for the University¡¯s Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station in . He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and returned to Storrs, where he spent the rest of his career. Each state has an Agricultural Experiment Station, designated and funded by the government to promote agricultural innovation across the country and to bring new and useful plant varieties to the American public. During his time at SAES, Scarchuk bred 7 All-America Selection winners, including Candlelight ornamental peppers, Dark Opal basil, and Table King squash. Of Black Beauty, the New York Times in wrote: ¡°This new variety with a heavier crop and longer season will bring added praise. Black Beauty can be picked when merely the size of a big dill pickle or when large as a cucumber. The flesh is tender, sweet, and buttery¡­ The more that is picked, the more that is produced.¡±  Hamilton, Robert. ¡°Tomorrow¡¯s Plants on 7 County Plots.¡± The New York Times,   Hastings, W. Ray. ¡°All-America Flowers Add Vegetables for ¡®57.¡± The New York Times,   P¨¢palo  While many of the fruits and vegetables we eat result from decades, and sometimes centuries, of breeding and selection, other foods on our plate are not that far removed from those we can find in the wild. Porophyllum ruderale is one of those species, a green herbaceous plant that grows extensively across the Americas, especially in disturbed soils.? Because the herb is used by many different cultures, it has many names, including summer cilantro, killi (from Quechua killki?a), cilantro boliviano, and yierba porosa, which refers in Spanish to the large pores on the leaves that release a strong smell when crushed. Perhaps its most common name in the United States, p¨¢palo, comes from the Nahuatl word for butterfly: papalotl. You may recognize other Nahuatl words in our culinary vocabulary, like xococatl (chocolate), tomatl, (tomato), ahuacatl (avocado), chian (chia), and even ch¨©llip¨­ctli (smoked chiles, or chipotle).  Indigenous Americans have used p¨¤palo for centuries as a flavorful, fresh addition to foods and as a medicinal herb, and its existence was an important part of the prehispanic diet. Many people still harvest p¨¢palo from wild sources or introduce it to certain locations, where it is left to establish itself. More recently, p¨¢palo also has been introduced as a cultivated crop on both small and large farms. Farmers who plant and tend p¨¢palo tend to favor plants that are shorter stature, less pungent, and have small, round, well-formed leaves, and the seeds from varieties that carry these characteristics are considered prime examples of the species. For this reason, cultivated p¨¢palo tends to be smaller and less fibrous than its wild relatives¨Ca reminder that humans and the foods we eat are constantly evolving with and alongside one another!

The Boss Pumpkin: An Interview with Plant Breeder Lindsay Wyatt  Anyone who has picked out a pumpkin for carving probably has ideas about what makes an excellent Jack O¡¯ Lantern: a perfect shape, dark orange coloring, maybe a nice, sturdy handle. When Johnny¡¯s Selected Seeds set out to develop a new Halloween pumpkin, plant breeder Lindsay Wyatt had her eye on many of those same things.  ¡°We take on yield and uniformity and color,¡± she said. ¡°The handles also have to be strong enough for someone to pick up a pumpkin by the handle and not break.¡± Importantly, she wanted to breed a pumpkin that was prolific enough for commercial growers to sell at the grocery store. ¡°But we also wanted a pumpkin that would be really nice and lovely for someone to grow in their garden for their kids to carve for Halloween,¡± she added.  At the Johnny¡¯s research farm in Maine, Wyatt and her team make over 70 new hybrid combinations every year, selecting the parent varieties that have desirable traits, and combining them via hand pollination. The next year, they grow the resulting hybrids to determine which combinations produce results that meet their goals. At harvest time, they invite the entire farm crew to walk the field and place a flag near their favorites, like an experimental pumpkin patch.  From the beginning, she knew one variety in particular would be a winner. ¡°It was so good the first year, we grew extra the next year to make sure it wasn¡¯t a fluke. It was almost hard to believe,¡± she said.  When it came time for the crew to place their votes, there were indeed a lot of flags clustered around one plot. The crew was so enthusiastic about the variety, they thought it should have a name that recognized it for being outstanding in the field. ¡°Someone basically said, we should name it The Boss,¡± she laughed. ¡°And we were all like, yeah, that¡¯s the name now.¡±  And where did The Boss get its good looks? Wyatt nods to the late University of New Hampshire professor Dr. Brent Loy, who developed over 80 squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin varieties over his long career. ¡°One of those lines is a big part of The Boss¡¯ genetics,¡± she said. ¡°So this definitely would not be possible without public plant breeding.¡±  Herself an alumna of a public plant breeding program, Wyatt originally studied biology in college before learning about the Plant Breeding Department at Cornell University. Growing up, she had worked summers in her father¡¯s nursery and always wondered where all the different colored petunias came from, but it wasn¡¯t until she started looking for graduate school programs that she realized there was a dedicated field of study for creating new and interesting plant varieties.  As for how she made the leap from petunias to pumpkins, she chalked it up to serendipity and the projects available at Cornell and later, at Johnny¡¯s Seeds. ¡°And then,¡± she added, ¡°I find that once you start working with any crop, you start to love it.¡±  Berkeley Tie Dye Tomato: An Interview with Plant Breeder Brad Gates  If you¡¯re lucky enough to visit a Berkeley Tie Dye plant when it¡¯s fruiting, it may be obvious how this pink and yellow and green-striped tomato came by its name. In fact, according to tomato breeder Brad Gates, the exchange that dubbed this famous heirloom went down with no words at all.  ¡°I was selling tomatoes at the farmers¡¯ market in Oakland, about a mile from Berkeley, and a guy wearing a tie-dye shirt came over and held the tomato to the middle of his chest. He gave me this funny look like, ¡®Hey, it looks just like my shirt...¡¯ I didn¡¯t realize what a pivotal scene was playing out in those few seconds.¡±  Now, Berkeley Tie Dye is known around the world for its groovy looks and gourmet flavor. But when Gates started selling tomatoes, he didn¡¯t even know just how much diversity existed in the crop.  ¡°I started working on a Saturday for a friend doing the farmers market about 25 years ago,¡± he said. ¡°I was expecting to show up and have all these red tomatoes to sell. But there were all these yellow and pink and purple ones and people were asking questions about them. I had to force myself to step outside my comfort zone and start tasting them.¡±  The experience had so intrigued Gates that he decided to grow tomatoes full-time. He started with dozens of heirloom varieties to find the tomatoes that grew well, tasted good, and produced prolifically. ¡°We would get left with a bunch of them at the farmers market and others would sell out,¡± he said. Naturally, he began saving seeds from the varieties that did well.  ¡°With heirloom varieties, you can save your own seeds,¡± he said. And because tomatoes are self-pollinating, you¡¯ll often get a similar tomato year after year. ¡°But once in a great while, you¡¯ll get a natural cross-pollination, and a couple of plants show up that aren¡¯t what they¡¯re supposed to be.¡± As he was growing thousands and thousands of plants for the market, Gates took some of the new crosses he was seeing and began to grow them out, too. ¡°And that was how I got into breeding tomatoes,¡± he said.  Fortunately for the world he did, because he was just about ready to hang up his farmer¡¯s hat and get a different job. But as he saw people¡¯s reactions to the new varieties he was breeding, he decided to stick with it. ¡°I had the thought, ¡®At one point, I¡¯m the only person in the world holding Berkeley Tie Dye.¡¯ And every restaurant I go to, everyone says, ¡®Wow, these tomatoes are amazing. So I was thinking, ¡®Well, the world shouldn¡¯t be without this.¡¯¡±  Gates sells mostly seeds and seedlings now, and you can find varieties he¡¯s bred in farms and gardens from sea level to seven thousand feet. In fact, he says, when someone grows open-pollinated seeds and saves them from year-to-year, they¡¯re creating adaptation to challenging environments.  The diversity preserved in the process will ensure that people can feed themselves in all these different places, he added. ¡°I¡¯ve had people tell me that one of my varieties was the last producing tomato plant in a summer in Tucson, and I¡¯ve had people have good results growing close to the San Francisco Bay, where it¡¯s always cool and foggy.¡±  ¡°Having diverse genetics and being able to select again and again in your area, it¡¯s one of the best things for people who want to grow a garden,¡± he said. ¡°It doesn¡¯t take a white coat and a biology degree. Even a home gardener can grow something unknown or something special that you can¡¯t get at the store.¡±  All it takes, according to Gates, ¡°is common sense and determination to grow a decent number of plants for a decent number of years.¡±","This article features two plant breeders, Dr. Brent Loy and Brad Gates, who have developed new varieties of squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin, as well as tomatoes. The article highlights the importance of public plant breeding in developing new crop varieties, citing Dr. Loy's work on over 80 different lines. It also features an interview with Brad Gates, a tomato breeder who has developed several new heirloom tomato varieties, including the famous ""Berkeley Tie Dye"" tomato. Gates recounts how he started selling tomatoes at farmers' markets and was surprised to find a wide diversity of colors and flavors in the crop. He began saving seeds from the varieties that did well and eventually started breeding his own tomatoes. His work on heirloom tomatoes led him to develop new varieties, such as Berkeley Tie Dye, which is prized for its unique appearance and flavor. The article also touches on the importance of preserving genetic diversity in crops, particularly through open-pollination and seed saving. Gates notes that when people save seeds from year to year, they create adaptation to challenging environments and ensure that there will always be diverse genetics available for future generations. Some key points from the interview with Brad Gates include: * The importance of public plant breeding in developing new crop varieties * The diversity of heirloom tomatoes and the potential for creating new varieties through breeding * The value of preserving genetic diversity through open-pollination and seed saving * The ability of home gardeners to grow unique or special varieties of plants using saved seeds * The importance of determination and common sense in growing a decent number of plants over several years.","There is no mention of Dr. Brent Loy, a plant breeder who has developed new varieties of squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin, in the provided article text.

"FNS Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Mar 10,  This past February, I attended the Urban School Food Alliance winter meeting in Los Angeles, California, which included Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) sessions focused on child nutrition programs. Participants, which included food service directors from around the country, had the opportunity to ask questions about the child nutrition programs they administer, including the recent updates. Engaging with program leaders and seeing what child nutrition programs look like ¡®on the ground¡¯ is important to us. In addition to learning from the group, the meeting was a reminder of the many partners we have that share a common goal of continuing to elevate the role that healthy meals play in schools and for our children¡¯s future. We spent a day at the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) observing their warehouse and kitchen operations, and meeting with school officials. We also got a taste of the delicious meals LAUSD prepares for students. California was one of the first states to implement a statewide Universal Meals Program for all school children after the expiration of federal waivers during COVID, which allowed states to serve school meals at no cost to students. I commend the California state legislature and all state, county, and local anti-hunger advocates that helped to make this happen. As I travel around the country and visit sites that administer FNS food assistance programs and meet nutrition security advocates that share this passion, I am awed by the tremendous amount of work, dedication, and pride exhibited every day so that children in our communities have healthy, nutritious meals.

"Posted by the Food and Nutrition Service's Western Regional Office in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 02,  The first week of August, farmers markets across the nation celebrate National Farmers Market Week, highlighting their role in supporting healthy communities, food systems and stimulating local economies. Throughout the pandemic, farmers markets and USDA partners worked hard to remain safe, accessible outlets for healthy food, as well as a vital marketing outlet for small and mid-sized farmers. Farmers markets put rigorous safety plans in place and the Ecology Center fought to ensure that farmers markets were classified as essential businesses while sharing best practices around pandemic response with the broader farmers market community. More than 4,700 farmers markets and direct marketing farmers currently participate in SNAP, and in California, nearly 250 markets provided Market Match incentives to customers shopping with SNAP/EBT, Pandemic EBT, or Disaster EBT. Market Match is a farm-direct based nutrition incentive program led by the Ecology Center and funded through the USDA Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program and California Nutrition Incentive Program. ¡°Thanks to local farmers, we have an abundance of fresh fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods here in California,¡± said Jesus Mendoza, Jr., USDA Food Nutrition Service Western Region Office Administrator. ¡°Accepting SNAP at farmers markets expands the customer base for farmers and markets, increases access to healthy foods, and encourages sales of locally-sourced produce.¡± The Visalia Farmers¡¯ Market (a former USDA grantee) began offering packed produce boxes for preorder online in response to the pandemic. Market Match offered SNAP customers a 50% discount or $10 off the produce. ¡°Being able to save some money when using our P-EBT card on produce is a huge plus,¡± one Visalia Farmer¡¯s Market customer said. ¡°The funds will last us longer by shopping at the farmers market.¡±  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Tags:  Food and Nutrition Service  FNS  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition  Farmers Markets  National Farmers Market Week  California  SNAP  You May Also Like  SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food  Healthier Foods, Healthier Minds  National Women¡¯s History Month: Celebrating FNS¡¯ Unsung Heroines","What role do farmers markets play in supporting healthy communities, food systems, and stimulating local economies?","Farmers markets play a crucial role in supporting healthy communities by providing a safe and accessible outlet for healthy food, as well as being a vital marketing outlet for small and mid-sized farmers.

"Acting Deputy Chief, Forest Service Research and Development in  Forestry  Oct 04,  Access to high-quality water will be a defining feature of the 21st century. Record heat waves and drought are not only leading to more frequent and intense wildfires but are also putting one of life¡¯s most valuable resources at risk: the water we drink. A new Forest Service research report describes how extensively public drinking water systems rely on national forests and grasslands. Water use per person has been declining for decades; however, a variety of factors such as population growth, food production and ecosystem conditions under a changing climate are contributing to overall greater demand for water ¨C especially in certain parts of the country. In the West, national forests and grasslands supply drinking water to almost 90% of the people served by public water systems. Some western cities, like Aspen, Colorado, and Portland, Oregon, are more than 90% dependent on national forests alone for their drinking water. The story is similar in the eastern U.S., though most of this water is supplied by private forests. Still, more than a century of research has demonstrated that forested lands provide the cleanest and most stable water supply compared to other lands. Within the lower 48 states, more than 99% of people who rely on public drinking water receive some from forested lands. This report is the first of its kind to measure how individual national forests and grasslands contribute to surface drinking water supplies while accounting for networks of pipelines and canals that divert water from the source to areas of high need, also known as ¡°inter-basin water transfers.¡± These inter-basin transfers are incredibly important sources of drinking water, especially in the West, where cities like Los Angeles receive more than two-thirds of their water from forested lands in California and Colorado. By showing where our drinking water comes from at a fine scale, this report supports USDA¡¯s Wildfire Crisis Strategy, and work supported by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. It helps land managers prioritize forests and watersheds for hazardous fuels reduction, watershed management, and restoration treatments that protect people, communities and resources across the country.

"FSA Administrator Cooks and Connects to FSA Programs  During my travels to 46 states over the past two years, I¡¯ve explored Illinois cornfields, watched an oyster harvest in Connecticut, and admired beet fields in North Dakota. I¡¯ve toured a rooftop farm on a Brooklyn high-rise, and marveled at fresh vegetables grown in truck containers in the remote Alaskan Arctic.

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  Mar 02,  FSA Administrator Val Dolcini speaks at the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic. I recently attended the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic in Des Moines, Iowa, where I met with sportsmen, farmers, young people, wildlife biologists and others who are committed to strengthening wildlife habitat throughout America. It was exciting to see firsthand the passion for the native and restored grasslands and woodlands that typify the rural American landscape. I had the honor of speaking to the group, where I highlighted the 30th anniversary of USDA¡¯s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).? CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, is designed to reduce soil erosion, improve water and air quality, and provide habitat for wildlife. Interested landowners can establish long-term USDA-approved grasses or trees in exchange for USDA helping with the cost of establishing the plants and providing annual payments for 10 to 15 years. The covers along fields, streams and rivers prevent soil and nutrients from washing into waterways, reduce soil erosion that may otherwise contribute to poor air and water quality, and provide valuable habitat for wildlife. Since its enactment in , CRP has prevented more than 8 billion tons of soil from eroding, protected more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian and grass buffers, and provided more than 100,000 acres of bottomland hardwood trees and nearly 300,000 acres of flood-plain wetlands.? It has also created more than 250,000 acres each for duck nesting habitat and upland bird habitat. Although this is a federal program, this 30-year record of accomplishment was not achieved by USDA alone.? Partnerships with state, local, and nongovernmental organizations are the foundation upon which these important achievements have been built. Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever¡¯s President and Chief Executive Officer (left) and FSA Administrator Val Dolcini sign an agreement establishing a framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources Conservation Service, to maintain and enhance the productivity of pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitats on private and public lands. That¡¯s why I joined Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever¡¯s President and Chief Executive Officer, in signing an agreement to continue the longtime framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), to maintain and enhance pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitat on private and public lands.? These joint efforts include habitat conservation and restoration, scientific assistance, educational materials, and research collaboration. In addition, this five-year commitment helps support Pheasants Forever¡¯s Farm Bill biologist program at local USDA offices nationwide. Given the strong relationships Pheasants Forever has with farmers and ranchers across the country, including their significant contribution toward the successful sage grouse and lesser prairie chicken initiatives launched by USDA, we are pleased to renew our partnership. On behalf of my colleagues at USDA, I want to thank everyone who plays a role in making conservation programs like CRP so successful, and for helping make rural America, with its diverse flora and fauna, its abundant natural resources and its beautiful natural landscapes, better than we have ever known. CRP was made possible through the Farm Bill. To learn more about the Farm Bill or the Conservation Reserve Program please visit www.usda.gov/farmbill or www.fsa.usda.gov/conservation.

"KY Rural Development, Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Aug 22,   Dozens of people gathered in Monticello, Ky., on Wednesday to break ground on a project in which five local families began the process of building their own homes. Great partnerships can lead to great projects ¨C and this event highlighted several strategic partners that worked incredibly hard to make it happen, including USDA Rural Development, Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, Southern Tier Housing Corporation, the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises (FAHE) and the families of Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Yvonne Hernandez, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. Five families will become homeowners thanks to Rural Development¡¯s Mutual Self-Help and 502 Direct Loan programs. The families, from left, are Yvonne Hernandez, Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. This project began several years ago when Kentucky Highlands received a Rural Development Section 523 Mutual Self Help Housing grant for $250,000 in April . That money was designated for technical assistance to help 12 families that wanted to help build new homes. The selected families also were approved for Rural Development 502 Direct Loan funds, in addition to forgivable loans from FAHE, to pay for the cost of building the homes. The self-help housing ¡°sweat equity¡± concept is not new. Organized self-help housing started with the Quakers a number of years ago. This became a tradition of rural people, who had the determination and help of neighbors, to construct barns, homes and schools that became American¡¯s rural communities. The Section 523 program is used primarily to help very low and low-income households build their own homes and is targeted to families who are unable to buy clean, safe housing through conventional methods. Families participating in a mutual self-help project perform approximately 65 percent of the construction labor on each other¡¯s homes under qualified supervision, and the reduced labor costs make it easier for the families to own a home. Another great advantage of this program is that mortgage payments can be ¡°rolled into¡± the loan for families who can¡¯t afford to make them while the house is being built.

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  May 01,   Farmers and ranchers were among the first to practice conservation. It¡¯s not surprising when you think about it. They¡¯ve always understood the importance of caring for our land and water, and they depend on our natural resources for their livelihoods. They¡¯re at the forefront of our country¡¯s efforts to keep the land healthy, productive and resilient. And we¡¯re proud to partner with them in that effort. This year, we¡¯re celebrating two more conservation milestones: the 30th anniversary of USDA¡¯s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation; and registering the 1 millionth acre in CRP¡¯s State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE) initiative. The 1 millionth acre is part of the Coteau-Drift SAFE, located in North Dakota. The state has a total of four SAFE projects, covering over 122,000 acres.? The projects are helping a wide range of species ¨C from pheasants, grouse, prairie-chicken, grey partridge, deer and other game animals ¨C flourish and grow. The Coteau-Drift SAFE is designed to register more than 69,000 acres in the state¡¯s Missouri Plateau and Drift Prairie region to support waterfowl, shorebirds and terrestrial birds.? Through SAFE, state agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations, and even local groups work together to identify at-risk wildlife, and to submit proposals to USDA for review.? Once approved, agricultural producers within an approved SAFE area can voluntarily enroll acres in 10 to 15 year contracts. In exchange, USDA provides annual rental payments, incentives, and cost-share assistance for establishing plant species that attract wildlife. There are now 98 SAFE habitat partnerships in 37 states and Puerto Rico. And the numbers don¡¯t end there. Each year, through CRP programs, we work with hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers to implement voluntary conservation practices on their operations. CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, provides significant economic and environmental benefits to hundreds of rural communities. CRP initiatives, like SAFE, encourage federal, state and local partnerships, showing us that when we all work together, everyone benefits.

"Farm Service Agency Administrator in  Conservation  Nov 13,  Sample FSA County Committee election ballot. This is a great time of the year for the Farm Service Agency (FSA), not just because of another successful American harvest, but because of the opportunity for agricultural communities throughout the country to vote for officials to represent them on FSA County Committees. In my first year as FSA Administrator, I¡¯ve traveled to 32 states and visited with farmers and ranchers from California to Maine. I know firsthand the impact of successfully delivered farm programs in rural communities all across this great nation. Working with county committee members while serving as FSA state executive director for California and now as Administrator, I have a deep appreciation for the essential role these farmer-elected committees play in connecting FSA with the needs of local producers. County committees have been making a difference for producers for more than eight decades.? They were originally established back in to ensure that local producers could provide input to the federal programs that offered financial assistance to farmers.? Today, nearly 7,700 FSA county committee members serve nationwide by applying their knowledge and judgment to make important decisions on commodity support programs, conservation programs, indemnity and disaster programs, emergency programs and eligibility.? Each county committee has three to 11 elected members who serve three-year terms and one-third of county committee seats are up for election each year. Producers elected to committees have always played a vital role in local agricultural decisions. They are essential to the daily operation of nearly 2,200 offices across the country. It is a valued partnership that helps us better understand the needs of the farmers and ranchers we serve. That is why I am encouraging all eligible producers to vote during this year¡¯s county committee elections. Through your vote, you are selecting someone from your county who will provide critical local input on FSA programs.? The elections began Nov. 9, with the mailing of ballots to all eligible producers. Ballots must be completed and returned to the county office or postmarked by Dec. 7 to be counted. Voters who did not receive a ballot this week can pick one up at their local FSA office. To learn more, visit www.fsa.usda.gov/elections.? Make your vote count!

As rural communities search for new and viable economic approaches, it is becoming clear that one core component of many successful rural communities is the presence of vibrant arts and cultural opportunities. Last month I had the opportunity to speak about rural arts initiatives and how USDA Rural Development is engaged with local communities and private foundations to provide awareness of our infrastructure programs and how they can assist in supporting local cultural strategies. At the Americans for the Arts annual meeting I had the honor of representing USDA on two panels where our Rural Development programs were part of the mix.? The sessions included discussion of ArtPlace, a consortium of national and regional foundations, and their efforts to support rural communities. Projects in Lanesboro, Minnesota and Ajo, Arizona are recent ArtPlace grantees, and we had the opportunity to explore ways in which USDA¡¯s infrastructure programs might be able to leverage this new boost of philanthropic support as these communities work to demonstrate how cultural development is an essential ingredient for rural communities in the next generation. One recent example demonstrating strategic alignment between foundations and USDA is an artist housing project in downtown Minot, North Dakota.?? The Magic City Lofts received an ArtPlace grant in to help complete construction of the building.? And this June, one of the new tenants in the building, the Turtle Mountain Tribal Arts Association received a $97,000 USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant for technical assistance associated with establishing a storefront gallery for tribal artists in the new building. The conference also allowed USDA to discuss our various programs and those of other federal agencies.? Our ongoing collaboration with the Partnership for Sustainable Communities is one way the Obama Administration is supporting rural areas. Last year¡¯s Rural Jobs Accelerator grants were a call to promote regional approaches to economic development, and one of the successful grantees involved a regional cultural strategy in SW Virginia centered on the Crooked Road Heritage Trail.? The project involved funding from USDA, the Economic Development Administration, and the Appalachian Regional Commission. Construction continues at the Sonoran Desert Retreat Center in Ajo, Arizona which was a recent recipient of an ArtPlace grant from national foundations. USDA has also provided funding to the Center over the years, including a community facility grant for the courtyard garden in foreground. Photo courtesy of Tracy Taft.

"The Program The Farm Bill created the Program to help underserved farmers, ranchers and foresters who have historically experienced limited access to USDA programs and services. The Farm Bill expanded the Program to include veterans. The objective of the Program is to show USDA¡¯s commitment to ensuring that underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters can equitably participate in USDA programs. Grants are awarded to community-based and non-profit organizations, higher education institutions and eligible tribal entities with at least 3 years of experience in working with socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers or veteran farmers and ranchers. Individual farmers and ranchers are not eligible to apply for Program grants. Because of differences in demographics, culture, economics, language and other factors, there is no one single approach to identifying solutions that can benefit underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. Program partners are based in local communities and rural areas where they serve a critical role in maximizing USDA¡¯s outreach efforts by identifying systemic barriers that need to be removed and working to increase equitable participation in USDA¡¯s programs and services. Projects funded under the Program include, but are not limited to, conferences, workshops and demonstrations on various farming techniques and other efforts to connect underserved farmers and ranchers to USDA local officials to help communities increase their awareness of USDA¡¯s programs and services.

"ARS Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Jan 17,  It may be winter, but it is still possible to access fresh, locally-grown produce. How? With aquaponics. Americans and people living around the world can grow crops year-round in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of their regions¡¯ climate or season. It also has the added benefit of supplying fresh fish to the local food system. ¡°Aquaponics is a blend of aquaculture and hydroponics, and is the most rapidly growing segment of global agriculture,¡± said Carl Webster, research biologist at the Agricultural Research Service¡¯s (ARS) Harry K. Dupree Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center in Arkansas. The aquaponics system begins with tanks where fish are grown ¨C usually tilapia, channel catfish, and hybrid striped bass. In these tanks, bacteria breaks down fish waste (feces and ammonia) into natural fertilizer. Farmers then irrigate their plants with this fertilizer in a hydroponic growing chamber. Plants raised using aquaponics typically include crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers. The result of aquaponics is a steady supply of fresh fish and vegetables that are available in local communities throughout the year and are grown in just about any environment ¨C from an abandoned inner-city warehouse to a climate-controlled facility in the middle of a desert. Additionally, aquaponics does not just benefit local communities; it also serves as an innovative and invaluable tool in addressing some of the world¡¯s most pressing challenges like hunger and climate change. ¡°According to the United Nations, there will be more than 9 billion people living on our planet by . We need to be smarter about how we grow food,¡± said Benjamin Beck, research leader at the ARS Aquatic Animal Health Research unit in Auburn, Alabama. ¡°Minimizing the space used to grow food and/or growing more than one crop at the same time could help relieve pressure on land production of crops while still providing a locally-grown source of food.¡±  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  Agricultural Research Service  ARS  USDA Science  fish  aquaculture  hydroponics  aquaponics  sustainable farming  You May Also Like  USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians¡¯ Engines  Meet Mari Gomez¡ªPublic Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community  Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",What are some innovative ways to grow crops year-round in various environments using aquaponics systems?,"According to the content, some innovative ways to grow crops year-round in various environments using aquaponics systems include: * Growing crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers * Minimizing space used to grow food by growing multiple crops at the same time * Growing crops in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of climate or season * Using abandoned inner-city warehouses or climate-controlled facilities in deserts as aquaponics systems"
"Posted by Agricultural Research Service Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Nov 23,  For many families, a Thanksgiving meal would not be the same without the sweet, tart goodness of cranberry dishes. A project funded by USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) at Oregon State University (OSU) is working to ensure that staple stays on the table. ¡°Weeds ¨C moss in particular ¨C are a big challenge to cranberry production, but the number of herbicides labeled for use on cranberry is relatively low,¡± said Cassie Bouska, associate professor of practice with OSU Extension Service. ¡°We lack effective controls for weeds that can, and ultimately will, take over a cranberry bed and drastically reduce production.¡± Research from Washington state found that increasing moss pressure reduced yield by at least half. With decreased cranberry yields and lower prices, some growers have struggled to break even in recent years.  ¡°That impacts the economic stability of farm families and rural communities,¡± Bouska said. ¡°An economically sustainable farm can move forward and find ways to improve its environmental sustainability.¡± A cranberry bed is a complete mat of cranberry vines ¨C 100% ground cover. Established weeds are difficult to control and hand weeding is time-consuming and expensive. As a result, the research team is studying various weed control tools and techniques to tackle troublesome weeds and may be closing in on a breakthrough. ¡°We¡¯ve tested some products that are very effective at controlling moss, while causing minimal or no damage to the cranberries,¡± Bouska said. ¡°Next year¡¯s field work will provide indications of whether there are additive effects of year-on-year applications. We¡¯re optimistic that we have some good candidates.¡±  Ensuring farming stays viable and profitable for our producers is essential.

In remarks at the World Leaders Summit, President Biden announced that the United States intends to mobilize $1 billion in investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years . Previewed at President Biden¡¯s Leaders Summit on Climate in April, AIM for Climate is a pioneering initiative uniquely focused on increasing investment and enabling greater public-private and cross-sectoral partnerships, intended to both raise global climate ambition, and underpin transformative climate action in the agriculture sector in all countries. AIM for Climate has already begun to bear fruit, garnering an ¡°early harvest¡± of $4 billion in increased investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years. AIM for Climate partners are mobilizing this investment to close the global investment gap in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Climate-smart agriculture is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, while adapting and building resilience to climate change and/or reducing/removing greenhouse gas emissions. AIM for Climate seeks to create incentives for, and mechanisms for maximizing the impact of, new investments toward an agriculture sector that is ready to face a changing climate. Government partners are providing the crucial foundation of AIM for Climate, through a wave of public investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Other sectors, including business, philanthropy, and other non-government partners are invited to build upon that foundation with ¡°innovation sprints¡± ¨C investments in specific, impactful, measurable, expedited efforts ¨C or by providing critical knowledge for identifying investment gaps, challenges, and opportunities. AIM for Climate has three primary objectives:  Demonstrate collective commitment to significantly increase investment in agricultural innovation for climate-smart agriculture and food systems over five years ;  Support frameworks and structures to enable technical discussions and the promotion of expertise, knowledge, and priorities across international and national levels of innovation to amplify the impact of participants¡¯ investments; and  Establish appropriate structures for exchanges between Ministers, chief scientists, and other stakeholders as key focal points and champions for cooperation on climate-related agricultural innovation, to engender greater co-creation and cooperation on shared research priorities. AIM for Climate focuses on increasing and accelerating investment in, and other support for, climate-smart agricultural innovation in the areas of:  Scientific breakthroughs via basic agricultural research through national-level government and academic research institutions;  Public and private applied research, including through support to international research centers, institutions, and laboratory networks; and  Development, demonstration, and deployment of practical, actionable, and innovative products, services, and knowledge to producers and other market participants, including through national agricultural research extension systems.

"USDA, FNS and written by Hannah Benson, Project Bread Program Manager in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 08,  Several studies consistently link poor access to food to poor health outcomes, including heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Project Bread, a Massachusetts¡¯ nonprofit focused on permanently solving food insecurity, teamed up with MassHealth to pilot the Flexible Services Program, or FSP, to bolster food security and meet nutritional needs from birth throughout childhood and beyond, improving health outcomes at every stage of life. Since April , over 7,000 MassHealth members (ranging in age from 0 months to 64 years) with complex health issues were given an array of food resources, including gift cards for groceries, cooking supplies, refrigerators, cooking classes, transportation assistance, and nutrition education. A recent evaluation of 491 clients, who engaged in the program between November ¨C October , significantly improved their diet and health as follows:  25% became food secure  Fruit and vegetable consumption increased by 3.5 servings per week  SNAP enrollment increased by 12.4%  99% reported that participation in FSP improved their health Project Bread employs 11 nutrition services coordinators to serve MassHealth clients across several languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Cape Verdean Creole, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Vietnamese. These coordinators help address racial inequity in underserved communities, as these communities are disproportionately affected by social and economic barriers to good health. The program has made life-changing improvements for many participants. When John A. in Gardner, MA lost his job as a cook at age 52, his diet and his health deteriorated, impacting his ability to regain employment. FSP resources gave John the opportunity to take back his diet and his future. ¡°Not only has this program helped me financially in terms of paying for groceries, but the cooking shows [hosted by Project Bread chefs and nutritionists] have reignited my passion for cooking.

"USDA Equity Commission Communications Lead in  Equity  Initiatives  Mar 14,  As a Latina woman, raised in a black community by a single white mother, Poppy Sias-Hernandez understands how access to equitable support and resources can have a life changing impact. In , Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer appointed Sias-Hernandez as the first-ever Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer (EIO) in the Executive Office of the Governor. In addition to her role as the Chief EIO, she also serves as the Executive Director of the Office of Global Michigan. In February , Sias-Hernandez became one of 15 members appointed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Equity Commission. Appointees serve two-year terms and bring a unique understanding of their individual fields and professional niches. The commission and its two subcommittees ¨C the Agriculture Subcommittee and Rural Community Economic Development Subcommittee - are tasked with evaluating USDA programs and services and recommending ways USDA can reduce barriers to access by implementing transformative changes. Sias-Hernandez credits gaining access to an affordable community college education with changing her life¡¯s trajectory. After high school, Sias-Hernandez moved to California to live with her father. There, she was able to take community college classes for $15 per credit hour, a complete departure from Michigan where community college was not financially accessible or feasible. This opportunity allowed her to become the first in her family to receive a college education, which included a bachelor¡¯s degree from University of California at Berkley and a master¡¯s degree in Organizational Change Leadership from Western Michigan University, where she received a Thurgood Marshall Fellowship. Her first class at Berkely was titled ¡°Women of Color in the U.S.¡±. According to Sias-Hernandez, that¡¯s where she did a lot of early thinking regarding issues concerning equity and inclusion. The experiences and knowledge gained from that course have been formative over the course of her personal and professional life. Sias-Hernandez credits the young female professor teaching the course with recognizing that the material had ¡°lit a fire within her¡±. Sias-Hernandez explains, ¡°She said to me, ¡®This is going to be a challenge in life. Are you ready? You are going to have to find a way to drive the change you want to see while understanding that you will likely never see it.¡¯¡± These words became the foundation to Sias-Hernandez¡¯s life. ¡°That was so formative and has been throughout my life because it is the truth,¡± said Sias-Hernandez. ¡°I still have that mindset. How do you keep showing up with love, integrity, and generosity knowing you¡¯re not always going to see the change you are working for?¡± As a professional, Sias-Hernandez has devoted much of her 20-plus year career to building and creating equity. During the pandemic, Sias-Hernandez partnered with other Michigan state government departments to build a migrant community response model to provide access to healthcare, financial assistance, and other resources to impacted farmworkers. One of her partners in this project, the Michigan Secretary of Agriculture, encouraged Sias-Hernandez to apply for the USDA Equity Commission. Initially, Sias-Hernandez was apprehensive about a potential role on the Commission, but says she quickly discovered how much good work was possible. More than six months into the work, she says she¡¯s impressed by the collective expertise of the Commission, and the group¡¯s willingness to collaborate and share their individual gifts, talents, and lived experiences. ¡°I am loving this Commission. I am loving the learning; I am loving the high level of commitment,¡± she said. ¡°It¡¯s the right formula to create terrific momentum and you have these Commissioners who are just super committed to doing good work.¡± From Sias-Hernandez's viewpoint, the work of the Equity Commission creates systems that are accessible to all population groups. ¡°Sometimes you hear equity talked about through an individual lens, referenced as meeting people where they are,¡± said Sias-Hernandez. ¡°But I really think about equity through a systems level lens and through a population level lens.¡± Sias-Hernandez describes governmental systems and programs like a current in a stream. ¡°These systems should be designed to keep people in the current. But what actually happens is that some people have to swim upstream to access the current, because it really wasn¡¯t made for them,¡± she said. ¡°My vision for equity is that we are creating a current that captures all people; that anyone can step into the stream and swim with the current rather than having to struggle against it.¡±  Category/Topic:  Equity  Initiatives  Tags:  equity  USDA  You May Also Like  Reflections from the Road in Pennsylvania: Charting the Path Forward with Urban Agriculture and the Next Generation  Dr. Jennie L.

"-Young, Under Secretary, Research, Education, and Economics & USDA Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Feb 28,  As I reflect on Black History Month, I think about the tremendous accomplishments and contributions made by Black Americans. I think of the past, present and future to acknowledge how far we¡¯ve come, where we are now, and the challenges ahead. For me, one the most concerning challenges still facing Black Americans is the disproportional high rates of cancer and chronic diseases. With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting half of all African American adults have some form of cardiovascular disease, and that Black men and women have the highest rates of dying from cancer ¨C something must change. This issue hits very close to home for me. Growing up in Georgia, food was a part of my communities¡¯ culture and heritage. Food brought people together, the dishes were delicious, however they weren¡¯t always good for our health. This led to many of our staple dishes being loaded with excess sodium and calories. Unfortunately, it was this approach to eating that left many of my family members ultimately fighting heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, and cancer. As jarring as this may seem, this is just one of many similar stories shared by Black Americans. Recently in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I heard similar experiences echoed by Black community members at a listening session at Southern University. This listening session was the first in a series hosted by USDA¡¯s Agricultural Science Center of Excellence for Nutrition and Diet for Better Health (ASCEND for Better Health) to discuss how food access, nutrition security, and diet affect health outcomes in underserved communities. ASCEND for Better Health is a new USDA initiative that aims to reduce the burden of diet-related chronic diseases, like cancer, by enhancing precision nutrition research and sharing that research with the communities it impacts. ASCEND for Better Health also supports President Biden¡¯s Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it and is tied to the goals laid out in the White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. As we step into National Nutrition Month tomorrow, I am hopeful for the future health and wellbeing of Black Americans thanks to initiatives like USDA¡¯s ASCEND for Better Health. A brighter future is ahead in which healthy, nutritious foods are accessible to all and specific nutrition advice is available so everyone can live long, high-quality and prosperous lives.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Jul 08,  According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 5.8 million Americans aged 65 or older live with Alzheimer¡¯s disease, and that number is projected to nearly triple by . Fortunately, USDA-funded research may have found a tasty way to slow disease onset. A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that diets high in flavonoids may protect cognitive health. Flavonoids are plant nutrients known for their antioxidant, antiviral, and anticancer properties and are found in berries, tea, dark chocolate, and other foods. ¡°Alzheimer¡¯s disease is a significant public health challenge,¡± said Paul Jacques, nutritional epidemiologist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. ¡°Given the absence of drug treatments, preventing Alzheimer¡¯s disease through a healthy diet is an important consideration.¡± Jacques¡¯s study, which followed 2,809 people for nearly 20 years, revealed that diets high in fruits and vegetables showed significant promise to quell the onset of Alzheimer¡¯s. ¡°Our study showed that individuals with the highest intakes of flavonoids were more than 50% less likely to develop Alzheimer¡¯s disease, relative to those with the lowest intakes,¡± he said. ¡°Plant foods, such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds are good sources of flavonoids.¡± According to Jacques, flavonoid-rich diets help more than just Alzheimer¡¯s disease and related dementia. ¡°The bottom line is that there are many reasons to consume a healthy diet, including lower risks of cardiovascular disease and some cancers.

"and Jess Ryan, USDA-ARS Office of Communications in  Research and Science  May 30,  The U.S. cotton industry contributes 35% of the cotton exported globally. Cotton processing can require intense work and training, including the proper use of the cotton gins commonly used to speed up the cleaning process of cotton seeds, removal of foreign materials, and compression of the cotton into lint bales. In perspective, one bale of cotton can make more than 200 pairs of jeans or 1,200 t-shirts. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service shows 509 active cotton gins are currently operating in the U.S. Recently, the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the National Cotton Ginners Association (NCGA) partnered in an annual outreach program to provide cotton ginners education and training for industry workers. USDA-ARS research leaders and the NCGA Vice President lead the efforts with assistance from USDA-ARS scientists, NCGA member associations, land grant universities, industry partners, and stakeholder groups. ""These annual schools are a significant outreach program to the industry and a diverse group of workers,"" said Greg Holt, research leader at the Cotton Production and Processing Research Unit in Lubbock, Texas. ""The schools' curriculum emphasizes increasing ginning efficiency, turning out high-quality fiber, and focusing on improving safety."" The schools represent a successful coordinated effort between the USDA-ARS and stakeholders. The first school was held at the USDA-ARS Cotton Ginning Research Laboratory in Stoneville, Mississippi, in , after a group of industry leaders and USDA officials saw the need for a training program that would teach ginning operations and safety. The Western Ginners School at the Southwestern Cotton Ginning Research Laboratory in Las Cruces, New Mexico, started in , followed by the Southwest Ginners School in Lubbock, Texas, in . Since , approximately 10,625 students have attended all three schools. The schools cover safety, hydraulics, pneumatics, machinery settings, and moisture control. In addition, a total of 465 individuals have successfully completed the Certified Ginners Program that began in . The curriculum continues to evolve to account for industry changes. Decades of training provided by the Cotton Ginners Schools reflect USDA¡¯s commitment to working with partners to ensure producers have the support they need to increase cotton production and quality.

"USDA-NRCS Public Affairs Specialist in  Conservation  Dec 18,   Each day U.S. farmers and ranchers make thousands of management decisions, ranging from when and what to plant to weighing options for conserving their operation¡¯s natural resources. They depend on an array of experts, research and to inform these decisions. One of their sources is the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), USDA¡¯s primary private lands conservation agency. NRCS generates, manages, and shares the , technology, and standards that inform conservation decisions by farmers and ranchers, policy makers and others. Many of these are generated through co-produced science, delivered by the NRCS-led Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP). CEAP assessments are carried out at national, regional, and watershed scales for conservation efforts related to cropland, grazing land, wetlands, and wildlife. First funded through the Farm Bill, CEAP quantifies and on trends in voluntary conservation practices, and associated outcomes, over time. CEAP findings help guide conservation program policies and support conservationists, farmers, and partners in making informed management decisions backed by and science.

"ARS Office of Communications in  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Jun 07,  Today is World Food Safety Day, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has launched a sweeping new initiative known as the Salmonella Grand Challenge. The project brings together an elite group of ARS, university and food industry scientists from different specialties to fight Salmonella, a foodborne pathogen that sickens over a million Americans each year, sometimes fatally. The challenge complements the work being done by the Food Safety and Inspection Service to develop a more effective strategy to reduce human Salmonella illness linked to poultry. ARS¡¯ goal is to integrate its research to learn more about how and where Salmonella causes the highest risk of contamination to meat and poultry products. That information will help researchers develop better monitoring tools for meat and poultry producers to detect Salmonella contamination. Salmonella, the bacterium that causes the illness called salmonellosis, lurks just about everywhere ¨C on animals (including pets), in food, water, soil and even air. People infected by Salmonella suffer symptoms that can include diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting. Serious infections can lead to life-long health problems and even death. The ARS team will integrate its ongoing research by combining, standardizing and coordinating efforts to create harmonized datasets. This will help them identify larger trends, emerging threats and novel Salmonella mitigation strategies. That¡¯s a large task because there are over 2,500 types of Salmonella bacteria and their risks are different across all production systems. The research team will use machine-learning tools to manage and bring together this huge amount of . The collaboration will help researchers learn from each other and will hopefully lead to break-through discoveries. The Salmonella Grand Challenge will enable researchers to better understand Salmonella risk, develop accurate models, and develop tools for meat and poultry producers to monitor their operations. Ultimately, the team hopes their efforts will contribute to the Healthy People objective of reducing salmonellosis by 25%. This work helps drive USDA¡¯s commitment to ensuring a safe U.S. food supply.

"National Agricultural Statistics Service Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Mar 17,  The states that produce some of the most nutritious and most consumed commodities within each of the five food groups. Many people want to cultivate healthier eating habits and March, National Nutrition Month, may be a great time to start. USDA¡¯s Food and Nutrition Service¡¯s MyPlate website is a resource available to help get on (or back on) the nutrition track. MyPlate itself is divided into five major food groups ¨C vegetables, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy and fortified soy alternatives. But do you ever wonder where your food comes from, and how much our hardworking farmers and ranchers produce in a year? Here are facts about some of America¡¯s favorite, nutritious foods: According to USDA¡¯s Economic Research Service (ERS), the tomato is one of the most commonly eaten vegetables in the country. In , U.S. farmers produced 24.1 billion pounds of tomatoes with California producing more than 97%. Apples are also a big hit in the U.S.. In , our growers produced nearly 11 billion pounds, nearly 69% of which came from Washington state. The average yield from each of Washington¡¯s 172,000 total apple bearing acres was 44,200 pounds! For , check out the Non-Citrus Fruits & Nuts Annual Report. Wheat, a health-promoting grain found in many foods, is one of our largest field crops. In , U.S. farmers produced 1.8 billion bushels of it, with North Dakota producing more than 17% of the total. For animal protein, according to ERS, chicken still tops the list in American diets. In , 58.3 billion pounds of chicken were produced in the U.S., more than 14% or 8.3 billion pounds in the top producing state of Georgia. New will be available on April 29 in the Poultry Production and Value Report. Finally, there is dairy. Versatile and packed with important nutrients, fluid beverage milk is one of the most consumed dairy products in the country. Americans consumed more than 46.4 billion pounds, or 5.4 billion gallons, of it last year alone. At the farm level (milk produced and used in all dairy products), U.S. farmers produced a whopping 223.2 billion pounds in ; California was the No. 1 milk producer with 41.3 billion pounds.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .23  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, Sept. 26, ¨C The U.S. Department of Agriculture today announced that it is giving an estimated 3,000 more school districts in high-need areas the option to serve breakfast and lunch to all students at no cost, by expanding the availability of the Community Eligibility Provision, commonly known as CEP. ¡°Today¡¯s announcement comes as we approach the one-year anniversary of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, where the Biden-Harris Administration promised to advance a pathway to healthy school meals for all students,¡± said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ¡°USDA has taken an important step toward fulfilling that promise by expanding access to CEP. Increasing access to free, healthy school breakfast and lunch will decrease childhood hunger, improve child health and student readiness, and put our nation on the path to better nutrition and wellness.¡± CEP is a simplified meal service option that allows schools to provide meals at no cost to all students without requiring families to apply for free and reduced-price meals. Instead, school districts receive federal funding based on a formula using existing from SNAP and other programs, and local or state funds must fill any gap between program costs and federal support. Before this final rule, at least 40% of students had to live in households participating in certain income-based federal assistance programs, in order for a school, group of schools, or school district to be eligible for CEP. This final rule lowers that threshold from 40% to 25%. While this change in CEP applies across the country, it will be particularly impactful in states and school districts which commit to supporting healthy school meals for all students with their own funds. Eight states have taken additional permanent actions to make sure hunger is not a barrier to children¡¯s success, in addition to allowing eligible schools to participate in CEP. California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont passed state laws allowing their schools to serve healthy school meals to all their students at no cost. In these states, schools that previously were not eligible for CEP can now take advantage of this final rule to experience more efficient, streamlined school meal operations as well as predictable federal funding levels. CEP ¨C and all models for providing healthy school meals for all at no cost ¨C is a win-win for schools, kids, families and communities and provides many benefits, including:  Lowering food costs for families;  Increasing food and nutrition security, especially for students from households that barely miss the cutoff to be eligible for free and reduced-price school meals;  Eliminating school meal debt;  Reducing social stigma for students who eat free or reduced-price meals, while other students pay full price;  Increasing student participation in school breakfast and lunch programs, which increases revenues and helps schools offer healthier meals; and  Saving time by simplifying program operations for hardworking school nutrition staff. ¡°Healthy school meals are an essential part of the school environment ¡ª just like teachers, classrooms and books ¨C and set kids up for success and better health,¡± said Stacy Dean, USDA deputy under secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. ¡°More children are fueled for learning and development when they can count on tasty, nutritious meals at school. While there is still more work ahead to ensure every K-12 student in the nation can access healthy school meals at no cost, this is a significant step on the pathway towards that goal.¡± USDA is also supporting expanded access to healthy school meals by offering extensive financial support for schools, including providing:  50 cents more per lunch and 18 cents more per breakfast for school year -24, compared to last school year¡¯s base reimbursement rates, through annual inflation adjustments and Supply Chain Assistance;  $30 million in Healthy Meals Incentives grants to 264 small and rural school districts nationwide;  $30 million in Equipment Grants for states and school districts operating school lunch programs; and  Nearly $11 million in Farm to School Grants, serving 1.2 million children. USDA also continues to expand its Direct Certification for Medicaid Demonstration Projects, which ensure that eligible children in households receiving Medicaid benefits automatically receive free or reduced price school meals without their families filling out an application. The demonstration projects have been implemented in 38 states, and USDA continues to invite more states to participate. In school year -, 1.4 million students received free and reduced-price school meals thanks to direct certification through Medicaid.

"State Director, Southern New England, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 26,  As USDA Rural Development (RD) highlights National Cooperative Month, one worker owned co-op in Massachusetts stands out as a model for sustainability, collaboration, and local food system resiliency. The saying goes ¡°it¡¯s not easy being green.¡± But for Real Pickles in Greenfield, Massachusetts, the co-op wouldn¡¯t have it any other way; they went green in with the addition of solar panels on its roof. Real Pickles Cooperative of Massachusetts RD assisted with the effort, providing $20,000 through the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). The 18.06kWH PV Solar System on the roof of the business was installed by neighboring worker owned solar co-op, PV Squared, and replaced 100 percent of the pickle co-op¡¯s energy needs at that time. So how did this green, innovative co-op come about? Two decades ago, Dan Rosenberg saw a need. Most pickles in the area were being produced with vinegar and preservatives. The old-fashioned pickle that Grandma used to make- naturally fermented with naturally occurring live cultures- was missing from local grocery store shelves. Determined to bring them back, Dan brought some veggies home from an organic vegetable farm where he worked and began making pickles the old-fashioned way. He was soon joined by wife and business partner, Addie Rose Holland, and Real Pickles launched in . They processed their pickles at a business incubator kitchen created by Franklin County Community Development Corporation, which provided a venue for making value-added foods with local farm ingredients. In , Real Pickles moved into their own building and expanded their operations. Today, the co-op sources its produce from eight locally owned farms and the future looks bright.

"Public Affairs Specialist with guest author Somali Bantu Community Association (SBCA) of Maine Executive Director Muhidin Libah and SBCA Intern Holden Turner in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Sep 22,  It¡¯s eight in the morning, and farmers with hand hoes and buckets have been here for two hours already, weeding and watering their plots before the heat of the day. Over 200 members of the Somali Bantu community of Lewiston, Maine, make the short drive out to Liberation Farms a few times each week to tend their crops. Visitors to our farm often comment on how few weeds they spot between stalks of corn. It¡¯s not magic, we tell them: our farmers are constantly in friendly competition to see who can have the best-looking plot. Like a large-scale community garden, Liberation Farms allows families to grow food for themselves. We want to feed our kids the foods that we grew up with in Somalia, like corn, greens, and goat meat. Working together, we can make this happen in a way we never could have individually. In , support from community partners helped us move our farm operations onto a single property where we have room for everyone ¨C and a herd of goats, too! Many people in our community are supporting large families through hourly-wage jobs. Since high-quality produce is otherwise unaffordable for us, growing for ourselves at Liberation Farms is a path to financial savings and food independence. We also use the SNAP and WIC programs to give our community and others much-needed nourishment, boosting the health and cultural connections of younger generations. Liberation Farms is also growing our Iskaashito program, through which farmers work together to sell vegetables at our farmers markets and farm stand. People beyond the Somali Bantu community are buying everything from cornmeal to tomatoes from us, and we encourage them to use food stamps to turn just a few dollars into a fresh basket of veggies. We are so excited to see what the future brings now that we have found a home here in Maine.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Dec 20,  Years ago, I spent my days watching pecan roots change the color of solutions from clear to red as they reduced iron for uptake. It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children¡¯s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics. Now, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I¡¯m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change. As an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce. My internship introduced me to the importance of agricultural research and attracted me to a career where I could use science to inform agricultural policy.

"Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Jun 22,  The Food and Nutrition Service¡¯s Mid-Atlantic Region recently joined forces with the New Jersey Department of Agriculture to recognize Programs for Parents, a Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) sponsor in Essex County, NJ, with a regional CACFP Achievement Award for their creative and dedicated efforts to promote nutrition security among children. Their program emphasizes meal quality, nutrition education, and the overall wellness of its childcare providers, children and parents/caregivers. Programs for Parents uses a variety of communication tools, shared in both English and Spanish, to translate the dietary into easy-to-use materials for childcare providers and families. Targeted Facebook posts focus on the importance of incorporating fruit and vegetables into food patterns, watching sugar content, and reading nutrition labels. They recently established a CACFP Facebook group where local childcare providers can share healthy recipes and ideas while also receiving nutrition and wellness tips. Programs for Parents uses their monthly newsletter, ¡°Child Care Matters,¡± to educate providers, parents and stakeholders on the value of good nutrition in early child development. A recent article discussed studies that have shown kids who eat breakfast have better attention spans and included a list of good morning foods for kids. Programs for Parents also offers hands-on learning to their communities. A registered dietitian nutritionist facilitated a virtual cooking class for providers last fall. The program sent providers three recipes in advance and provided them with a $25 gift card to offset the cost of ingredients they purchased to use during the class. Participants learned to make tasty turkey burger sliders and healthy snacks for children. Last year Programs for Parents also launched incentive grants of up to $ for CACFP providers, enabling them to purchase kitchen and food prep items such as refrigerators, freezers, crockpots, and utensils to help providers make healthy snacks and meals. Nearly all of the providers participated, and CACFP enrollment increased by 25%. The Programs for Parents CACFP program, operating since , is a great example of the inroads that early childcare providers can make into better health and nutrition for children and families in need.

"APHIS Legislative and Public Affairs in  Animals  Dec 04,  Bats are crucial to the wellbeing of our natural ecosystems, but also have the potential to spread disease. APHIS Wildlife Services and the One Health Commission recently sponsored a student infographic contest to help change the narrative on bats. Lately, when we hear about bats in the news it's often in the context of emerging infectious diseases. Yet, despite potential public health threats, bats are extremely important to the health of our natural ecosystems. Zoonotic diseases, or zoonoses, are those diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans. To help educate young adults about the importance of bats to our environment, as well as the potential for some bats to transmit zoonoses, such as rabies, USDA Wildlife Services (WS) and the One Health Commission (OHC) recently sponsored an infographic competition among college students. An infographic is a creative collection of images, charts, and minimal text to present or other information. ¡°To ensure participating college students had a good understanding of the issues surrounding bats and disease before they started designing their infographics, we developed a 5-minute video explaining the One Health approach and why it is key to addressing wildlife diseases like rabies.¡± states Alison Barbee, a biological science technician with the rabies research project at the WS National Wildlife Research Center. The One Health approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of people, animals, and the environment. It also encourages experts from multiple disciplines to work together locally, nationally and globally to achieve the best health for all three. The control of human rabies deaths and exposures through the vaccination of animal reservoirs, such as domestic dogs and terrestrial wildlife, is considered an example of a successful One Health approach. WS, OHC, and other agencies are building upon that success to address concerns about bats and the spread of rabies, as well as other diseases. ¡°If we are going to successfully manage bat rabies and other novel viruses for the benefit of bats, people and the environment, we need to better understand how these pathogens are maintained and spread in bat populations,¡± states Barbee. ¡°We also need to effectively communicate that information with others.¡± Winning infographic on bats and rabies created by Colorado State University graduate student Brooke MacNeill. The winner of the infographic contest was Brooke MacNeill, a graduate student in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University. MacNeill¡¯s infographic focused on the role of bats in the environment, and what is being done to prevent the spread of rabies from wildlife to people. Her design targeted students in grades 6 through 12 and was created in both English and Spanish. She received a $500 cash award and her design was shared with natural resources, public health, and One Health practitioners around the globe. The runner up was Stephen Nachtsheim a graduate student in Biomedical Communications at the University of Toronto. His design focused on the benefits of bats and their population declines due to various diseases. He received a $100 cash prize.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Jan 27,  The Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program helps vets repay qualified student loans for service as food animal veterinarians in selected areas of the country. (iStock image) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio. A solid education is crucial to those seeking careers in animal science. However, many student loans can be burdensome. But a student loan payment the size of a mortgage couldn¡¯t stop someone who has wanted to be a veterinarian since they learned to talk. Dr. Annie Bowes is one of those people. After acquiring the knowledge to begin her dream career, Dr. Bowes was left with overwhelming debt.? Luckily for this Idaho-based veterinarian, she wasn¡¯t left alone to repay it. In , she received assistance through the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) a program funded by USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Through VMLRP, NIFA may repay up to $25,000 each year of student loan debt to eligible veterinarians. ?In return, qualified veterinarians must agree to provide food animal medical care for three years in certain high-priority veterinary shortage situations.? VMLRP has helped 245 veterinarians since the program¡¯s inception in . ¡°I am thankful for this assistance,¡± Bowes said. ¡°It allowed me to establish myself in a rural area where it¡¯s difficult to be successful. I am now able to treat animals at six to eight different farms per day and have more than 600 repeat clients.¡± Veterinarians are critical to America¡¯s food safety, food security, and to the health and well-being of both animals and humans. Studies indicate there are significant shortages of food animal veterinarians in certain areas of the country. A leading cause for the scarcity in this profession is the heavy price tag that four years of professional veterinary medical training carries, which leaves current graduates of veterinary colleges with an average debt of $162,000. Bowes owns Aspen Veterinary Service, a mobile service treating large animals, as well as an Emergency Clinic with a staff of 15 and more than 10,000 repeat customers. Dr. Tim VanDerPloeg is another veterinarian using USDA¡¯s assistance to expand rural veterinary services. VanDerPloeg will open Veterinary Center of Somerset, in Kentucky, soon. Pulaski County, where the clinic will be located, is the third largest cattle county in the state of Kentucky.? The clinic will have a 2,300-square-foot large animal facility in addition to the 3,400-square-foot small animal facility. ¡°Although recipients of the loan repayment assistance are only to commit to three years of veterinary service in a designated shortage area, veterinarians like Bowes and VanDerPloeg suggest that the impacts from this funding and connections to their service areas go well beyond three years,¡± said Gary Sherman, VMLRP national program leader with NIFA. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service¡¯s Livestock and Poultry Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 15,  USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Purdue University have developed a series of training videos that illustrate proper sanitation assessment techniques to evaluate shell egg processing equipment. While the practices in these videos are in facilities that have USDA grading, they are valuable for any shell egg facility wishing to learn more about good sanitation techniques. To support emerging needs across the egg industry in recent years, AMS reviewed its internal procedures to assess equipment sanitation in shell egg processing plants. The agency visited over 30 shell egg processing facilities across the country to assess equipment sanitation and consistency. In order to document and share findings, AMS partnered with Purdue and ARS to develop this educational video series. The videos take the viewer through each phase of shell egg processing and explain how to inspect each component of the facility for sanitation effectiveness. The 18 videos are a great resource for shell egg processing facilities by illustrating what clean machines and facilities should look like prior to daily verification by USDA grading personnel.

Its purpose is to prevent contamination of food products during processing. USDA photo. Today kicked off ¡°Get Smart about Antibiotics¡± week in the United States and the World Health Organization¡¯s World Antibiotic Awareness Week in . During this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its other federal partners want to remind families and communities about the importance of responsible antibiotic use in both humans and animals, to help reduce the development of resistant bacteria. This week, we also celebrate the 20th anniversary of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS).? Through NARMS, USDA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborate on everything relating to antimicrobial resistant bacteria.? ?Since , USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) have been active participants in this combined federal surveillance program. So, what is antimicrobial resistance?? As you might recall, in , Dr. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug that revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections. In the years following, penicillin and the discovery and therapeutic use of other antibiotics, we have relied on antibiotics to treat and cure a variety of illnesses - in both humans and animals, across the globe. The use of these drugs has aided in the development of resistant strains of bacteria. Unfortunately, this development means that some previously treatable forms of bacterial infections are now resistant to the antibiotics that were designed to treat them. It is estimated that the decrease in effectiveness of antibiotics, results in more than two million U.S. cases of antibiotic resistant infections, annually. Some of these types of infections might require longer hospital stays and are more costly to treat successfully.? As scientists, we call this problem antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ?Dr. Fleming even raised this concern in after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of penicillin.? The AMR threat in humans and animals is becoming an increasing problem and requires the adoption of a One Health approach. ?This approach is founded on principles that recognize that the health of people and populations are linked to the health of animals and environments. For example, antibiotics are used in food-producing animals to prevent illness, limit the spread of infections in a herd or flock, and treat diseases. ?Because antibiotics are administered to animals, food products derived from them can serve as a vehicle for the movement of resistant bacteria to humans, just as antibiotics administered to people can affect the environment, including the environment of animals. The One Health approach brings together the expertise of physicians, veterinarians, environmental scientists, and other public health professionals so that problems can be identified and actionable solutions are developed that can minimize the emergence and spread of AMR. World Antibiotics Awareness Week USDA is uniquely positioned to contribute to the body of knowledge about resistant bacteria through the collaboration and ongoing work of experts both within and outside of the Department. For the last 20 years, ARS and FSIS have partnered alongside FDA and CDC to collect and define AMR bacteria in meat and poultry products. Through the NARMS program, ARS and FSIS continually monitor changes in AMR bacteria from animal meat through the FSIS regulatory testing program and from animals through the new cecal sampling surveillance program. ?The sampling results from these two programs help to identify new or changing resistant bacterial patterns and show comparisons between bacteria found in animals used for food and bacteria important in human medicine. This information is critically essential for scientists to understand how resistant bacteria emerge and spread. In , USDA in collaboration with its public health partners began using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to further characterize AMR bacteria in real-time. WGS is a process that can determine the DNA sequence of bacteria collected from food animal samples. This method allows scientists to understand similarities and differences between bacteria with greater detail than ever before. The information gained from WGS helps USDA and NARMS monitor AMR bacteria with more accuracy and to identify more specifically the types of bacteria that cause foodborne illness. Despite USDA¡¯s long history of significant activities and investments in AMR, including its strong twenty years of NARMS collaboration as well as USDAs¡¯ own AMR Action Plan (, 322 ); a considerable amount of work remains to be done to address knowledge gaps in AMR and for further strengthen the current programs. To achieve the greatest public health impact, USDA must continue to coordinate and leverage expertise across many areas. And to ensure that effectiveness of antibiotics is preserved for treating both people and animals and that it is extended to future generations, USDA, other federal agencies, industry, and academic partners are working together to better understand the role of animal production environments in the development and spread of AMR bacteria.?

The project included adding vegetation to eroding stream banks. (U.S. Forest Service) I am proud to announce that we exceeded our ecological restoration goals for Fiscal Year . This was no small feat. A lot of great people across the U.S. Forest Service worked hard to make it a reality. We did substantial homework and planning, and then based on that we made strategic investments across all agency programs to help us create resilient forests, grasslands and watersheds while sustaining communities. This work reduced the wildland fire threats to communities and firefighters and minimized the risk of forest pests and climate change, while supporting American jobs and rural economies. That is a fantastic combination. The results of this hard work are nothing short of amazing.? The projects we carried out lessened the threats to communities by reducing hazardous fuels on 1.7 million acres in the wildland urban interface, sustained or restored watershed conditions on 2.9 million acres and resulted in 2.8 billion board feet of timber volume sold. Impressively, we did all this despite simultaneously facing a government shutdown, as well as rising costs of fire-fighting that drain resources from our work across all program areas. On a personal level, these accomplishments reflect how much members of our Forest Service community are committed to improving the forests and grasslands that have been entrusted to us by the American people. For these reasons, I could not be more proud of everyone who has come together to make restoration such a success in the past year.

"DVM, Chief Veterinary Officer of the United States, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Dr. Kis Robertson-Hale, Chief Public Health Veterinarian of the United States, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Animals  Apr 27,  April 30 is World Veterinary Day: a day to celebrate veterinarians, their work and their impact. Although the importance of veterinarians is hardly a secret, people often forget that veterinarians¡¯ work goes beyond clinical care of animals. USDA employs more veterinarians than any other department in the federal government, with positions located across the nation and associated territories. The breadth of roles that veterinarians fill at USDA illustrates their versatility. Veterinary epidemiologist, emergency responder, laboratory diagnostician, and public health veterinarian are just some of the roles that USDA veterinarians fill every day. Resilience is the theme of this year¡¯s World Veterinary Day. From USDA¡¯s perspective, there could not be a more appropriate theme. From responding to the COVID-19 pandemic to inspecting livestock and poultry slaughter facilities to combating animal health threats like the recent detections of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, USDA veterinarians are on the frontlines protecting public health and animal health every day. Their contributions in both areas preserve an essential resource: a food supply that is both dependable and safe. As a nation, we can¡¯t be resilient¡ªin all senses of the word¡ªwithout that. Beyond ensuring a safe and dependable food supply, preparedness is key to staying resilient in the face of animal or human health threats. USDA works with state and tribal partners and other federal agencies in a collaborative effort known as One Health to protect animals, people, and the environment, which are all connected. The interplay of humans, animals, and the natural world affects diseases in animals and humans, and what we learn could help prevent or limit the next outbreak of diseases transmitted from animals to people, or even the next global pandemic. USDA veterinarians play a key role in the One Health approach. USDA veterinarians protect Americans and their animals every day. They make sure our country has a safe and dependable food supply and is prepared for whatever animal or human diseases may come. If you love agriculture and public health and are dedicated to helping your nation, we encourage you to explore opportunities at USDA.

"Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Mar 14,  Plan for spring cleaning, a checklist for a food safe pantry and fridge. The refrigerator and pantry are where most people store their food. But these storage areas may also be one of the less frequently cleaned places in your home, which could be hazardous to your health. The refrigerator is one of the most important pieces of equipment in the kitchen. Without it, our food would spoil and could make us sick. Refrigerators should be set to maintain a temperature between 34¡ã and 40¡ãF to preserve our foods. Setting the refrigerator temperature too low will cause your refrigerator to work overtime and could also freeze some of your foods. Many of today¡¯s advanced refrigerators have built-in thermostats that measure their internal temperature. If your fridge does not have a built-in thermostat, you should keep an appliance thermometer inside in a visible place to monitor the temperature. Here are some tips to make your fridge (and your home) more healthy and safe:  Clean spills immediately ¨C Clean surfaces thoroughly with warm, soapy water; then rinse. Do not use solvent cleaning agents or abrasives, as these may allow chemical fumes/tastes into your food and ice cubes and make them unsafe to eat.  Store leftovers safely ¨C Throw out perishable foods that have spoiled and no longer can be eaten. Leftovers like meatloaf, pizza or casseroles shouldn¡¯t be left in the refrigerator more than four days. Refrigerate raw poultry and ground meats for no more than one to two days.  Clean the exterior ¨C Keep your refrigerator free of dust and lint. Clean the condenser coil several times a year with a brush or vacuum cleaner to remove dirt, lint or other accumulations to ensure efficiency and maintain proper temperature. Cleaning your pantry will save you money by keeping you aware of what you have and help you avoid a pantry insect infestation. It will also ensure your foods are safe to consume. Here are some tips for a clean, bug-free pantry:  Check your cans ¨C Discard cans that are leaking, rusted, bulging or badly dented. Never use food from cracked jars, jars with loose or bulging lids, or any container that spurts liquid when you open it.  Throw out any food you suspect is spoiled ¨C Never taste food to determine its safety. Wipe off sticky containers, along with crumbs and spills on your pantry shelves with all-purpose cleaner, vinegar, or warm soap and water.  Check the dates on your foods ¨C ¡°USE by¡± date indicates that perishable products should be consumed by the date listed on the package or discarded once the date has passed. ¡°BEST if Used By¡± date informs shoppers that after the specified date, the shelf-stable product is safe to use or consume, but has exceeded the window of its optimal taste or performance. High-acid canned food such as tomatoes, grapefruit and pineapple have a shelf life of 12 to 18 months beyond their listed dates. Low-acid canned food such as meat, poultry, fish and most vegetables can be kept for two to five years beyond their listed dates ¡ª if the can remains in good condition and has been stored in a cool, clean and dry place. If you have questions about storage times for food or beverages, we recommend downloading our smartphone and tablet application, the FoodKeeper. With more than 150,000 downloads for Android and iOS smartphones, the FoodKeeper is quickly establishing itself as the quick reference go-to guide for safe food storage and preparation.

"White House Fellow in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 02,  A local WIC staff member holds her sleeping baby as she listens to the peer counseling instructor. March is Women¡¯s History month, a time when we highlight everything woman.? In the midst of farming and biofuels, research and forestry would you believe that the USDA also finds time to promote breastfeeding?? The answer is absolutely!? You already know that the agency supports a myriad of nutrition programs to help make America¡¯s children healthy and hunger-free.? Research has shown that there is no better food than breast milk for a baby¡¯s first year of life. Breastfeeding provides many health, nutritional, economical and emotional benefits to mother and baby. Since a major goal of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) Program is to improve the nutritional status of infants, WIC mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their infants. WIC promotes breastfeeding to all pregnant women as the optimal infant feeding choice, unless medically contraindicated.? So what exactly is WIC doing to support breastfeeding?? The answer is a lot! WIC moms and babies who exclusively breastfeed receive an enhanced food package for a longer duration than non-breastfeeding mothers. Exclusively breastfed babies do not receive formula in their package. Breastfeeding moms can receive breast pumps, breast shells, and other nursing supplies to encourage increased initiation and duration of breastfeeding. WIC mom¡¯s who breastfeed receive support through counseling, educational materials, and peer support from fellow WIC moms that have breastfed their babies. We recognize that the food package alone is not enough to change behaviors.? Mother¡¯s need support education, and encouragement to breastfeed.? WIC clinics provide peer counselors, women who can personally relate to other WIC moms, to help support breastfeeding.? Some WIC clinics also provide education to fathers and grandmothers as we recognize that they play a crucial role in a mother¡¯s decision to breastfeed. USDA doesn¡¯t just promote breastfeeding for the clients it serves; we are helping to support women who choose to breastfeed when they return to work at USDA as well.? The Nursing Mother¡¯s Working Group is committed to investigating whether USDA is currently meeting the needs and requirements of its new and expectant mothers who wish to continue lactation after they return to the office.? A Department-wide effort is underway to assess the current state of the USDA Nursing Mother¡¯s Program and identify where improvements need to be made.? The USDA hopes to be a leader in the Federal Government in changing the culture of the workplace to support employees who are devoted to their families. USDA is in the midst of updating its Loving Support makes Breastfeeding Work campaign. This is a nationwide social marketing campaign to encourage the initiation and duration of breastfeeding for all women. Stay tuned for events leading up to World Breastfeeding Week in August.

"USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  Jun 20,  Josepha preparing amaranth greens for a recent dinner put together by some of our gardeners from Burundi. Every month, USDA shares the story of a woman in agriculture who is leading the industry and helping other women succeed along the way. In honor of World Refugee Day, this month we hear from Josepha Ntakirutimana, a refugee from Rwanda who settled in Tucson, Arizona in . Josepha is now an invaluable part of the Tucson New Roots Program which brings together refugees and their community around production and nutrition education activities. Josepha¡¯s journey to Tucson is a long one ¨C as for any refugee, the memories are sometimes painful. When she was a girl, at the age of 12, Josepha started helping her mom at a local farm before school. Later, she worked on a farm during school holidays and, when she was married, her family had a small plot in town where they could grow vegetables and grains to help reduce food costs. After the war, when she left Rwanda and entered into a refugee camp in Malawi, agriculture continued to help her and her family survive. There wasn¡¯t enough food but she was able to start a garden and grew amaranth, squash, and carrots. Being able to carry out this activity in the refugee camp was a welcome change of pace to the camp life, which was hard and full of uncertainty. Gardening also allows for refugees to have access to fresh food, which is welcomed in refugee camps, where food is very limited in amounts and variety.  Now, Josepha considers it a ¡®great joy of living¡¯ to be able to garden and grow her own vegetables in her new home of Tucson. Agriculture is a thread that connects Josepha¡¯s past, present, and future ¨C and is a veritable lifeline. Her refugee story is a real inspiration. Like all the refugees the IRC works to help resettle in the U.S,. she is a survivor, and we are honored to be working with her to help refugees to start a new life in her community. The IRC has 29 offices and helps? 6,000 - 10,000 new arrivals each year in acclimating to their new communities. Over the past 10 years, the IRC has reshaped expectations for nutritional well-being among its refugee clients, and has developed a multifaceted food security and agriculture program called ¡°New Roots"" to increase the supply of and demand for fresh, culturally appropriate foods within immigrant and refugee communities To learn more about their work please visit www.rescue.org/ and follow on twitter at @theIRC. 1. Josepha, can you share your story with us? As a refugee, what was your journey to the United States like? I was a nurse for 21 years in Rwanda. In , there was a genocide in Rwanda. My husband, four children and I were displaced from southern Rwanda to western Rwanda. There I worked as a nurse at a Hospital with a humanitarian aid organization and my husband worked as an interpreter. Because the organizations trusted us, our coworkers became jealous and falsely accused my husband of participating in the genocide. My husband was summoned to the police station and put in jail. He was jailed in prison in southern Rwanda, where he spent nine years. I consider agriculture to be a very important aid during this tough time in my life. Alongside my career, I was practicing agriculture to be able to feed my children and be able to bring biweekly food to my husband in prison. My husband was freed from jail in , but we fled our country so he would not be detained again. We traveled to Malawi and ended up in a refugee camp. It was my first time outside of my country and it felt like going to hell. I was depressed and could not see my future. Much of the food was spoiled, but I fed my family beans, which were still safe to eat. To feed my family, I would ration the beans to the last month. Eventually, I started a garden of amaranth and squash and would mix the beans with the squash to make them last. After a few years, we moved to another refugee camp in Malawi where I could see people I knew from Rwanda. My mind was renewed. I started to go to school to learn English, tailoring, computer skills and counseling. To support my family, I worked in a tailoring shop. After getting a counseling certificate, I became a school counselor and started a group for unaccompanied minors. I created projects to help them make money while encouraging them to stay in school. After nine years in refugee camps, my family resettled in Tucson, Arizona. Fortunately, after 5 months my husband and I found caregiver jobs and I began interpreting for the IRC. Eventually, I became a Community Well-being Promoter and was able to combine my interpretation skills and my passion for food and agriculture. 2. How has your connection to agriculture changed depending on the country in which you live? The biggest difference is in climate ¨C the desert here is dry and hot ¨C Rwanda is dry and humid. Here there¡¯s use of irrigation systems, but in my native country, we depend only on rain.? I was able to raise animals for compost, but I am not allowed to do that here.? There are many plants that are new to me and each has its own season with new tastes, new textures. 3. What is the New Roots Program? The New Roots program helps refugees to become involved in agriculture and to grow their own food. We connect interested refugees to community garden space and provide them with seeds and other resources. We host trainings to help gardeners transfer their agricultural knowledge to the particular climate of the Sonoran Desert. We also enroll clients in public benefits (such as SNAP and WIC) upon arrival, and we implement a 3-module nutrition education with families in need. 4. Have you experienced culture shock? The trip to the United States was difficult; it was my first time flying. We were served new food in flight.? English was a problem because of the difference in pronunciation. My family thought the United States was cold but when we arrived in Tucson at night it was still 100¡ã F when we got off the plane. I had hoped to continue my nursing and counseling education in the U.S., but the cost of living is too high, making it unaffordable to also pay for my education.? Finding work is difficult in a new country and bringing in an income was my first priority.? 5. From which communities do you receive the most support and what have you learned from them that is the most valuable to you? Most of my support has come from International Rescue Committee and from an elderly Caucasian woman whom I met soon after arriving in Tucson.? We have become as close as mother and daughter and from her I can always receive help and advice. 6. Who are your role models? My mother, who just died in Rwanda, was a hard-worker and a confident lady who introduced me to agriculture.? I have her to thank for my love of agriculture. 7. Where do you see yourself in 5, 10, 20 years; how to get there? In five years, I hope to have developed my back yard into a large garden to raise enough food to feed my family with more that I can sell.? In ten years, I hope to have the mortgage on my home paid off.? In twenty years, I hope to be retired and able to enjoy my garden and my grandchildren. 8. What advice for young women interested in agriculture? Share experiences with others, listen to others and share knowledge, never give up their dreams, no matter what they aspire to be in this world. 9. What¡¯s best advice you receive from someone? To trust in myself. Learning doesn¡¯t stop: continue to learn in different ways as long as you are alive.

Seventy years ago, when Nat ¡°King¡± Cole first regaled us about roasted chestnuts in The Christmas Song, not many Americans could actually enjoy the treat because American chestnut trees were in dire straits. The predominant tree in Eastern American forests was nearing the tail end of a 50-year blight that killed an astonishing three to five billion trees, making the species functionally extinct. Now, however, researchers supported by USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) are working to restore the American chestnut and may be only a few years away from bringing back the iconic tree.  Alexandra Wilson, National Institute of Food and Agriculture  Posted in  Research and Science  May 10,   5 Responses",What are some ways that agricultural research can help restore and bring back functionally extinct species?,"Agricultural research can help restore and bring back functionally extinct species by: 1. Developing disease-resistant varieties through breeding programs, such as the American chestnut's blight-resistant trees. 2. Using biotechnology to introduce beneficial traits or genes from related species into the functionally extinct one. 3. Creating controlled-environment nurseries for propagating plants that can be reintroduced into the wild. 4. Conducting ecological studies to understand how the restored species will interact with other organisms and ecosystems. 5. Developing management strategies, such as habitat restoration and population monitoring, to ensure long-term survival of the restored species.

"Pacific Southwest Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 08,  Barbara C. Weber in as director of the U.S. Forest Service¡¯s Pacific Southwest Research Station. (Photo courtesy Barbara C. Weber) As the oldest of 11 children, Barbara C. Weber is accustomed to being the ¡°first.¡± With top family ranking comes responsibility, and Weber had plenty of it. Growing up on her family¡¯s 160-acre dairy farm in Bloomington, Wis., Weber, along with her siblings, helped clean the barn, pick up eggs and tend to the animals.? Her innate curiosity and connection to nature led to her love of science. She was the first in her family to go to college, graduating from Viterbo College, a women¡¯s school in LaCrosse, Wis., with a degree in biology. She would go on to earn a master¡¯s degree in entomology at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and a doctorate in zoology from Southern Illinois University. Few women ranked among the agency¡¯s scientific community when Weber joined in . She became the first woman scientist at the North Central Research Station¡ªwhich later became the Northern Research Station. But being first had its challenges. In , Jackie Robertson, a research entomologist at the Pacific Southwest Research Station became the first to head a research project. Five years later, Weber followed suit. But even as she gathered more experience and prestige in her career as a scientist, Weber was often reminded in both subtle and not-so-subtle ways that she was a woman in a man¡¯s world. She recalls one incident where she arrived with colleagues to a meeting to discuss a project she was spearheading. She was the only woman in the group. While the men mixed and mingled, no one paid any attention to Weber. ¡°They assumed that I was along for the ride, or that I was someone¡¯s wife,¡± Weber said. An embarrassed hush fell over the group when she announced that she was the project leader. ¡°It was fun for me to see their reaction,¡± Weber said. And while Weber managed to keep a lighthearted attitude most of the time, she did admit that at times, the unequal treatment¡ªa snub here, an inappropriate comment there¡ªoccasionally wore on her. But Weber never gave up and through her professionalism proved to be a promising leader. She would go on to work at Forest Service headquarters in Washington, D.C. as a legislative resources specialist, and later staff assistant for planning in the Office of the Deputy Chief for Research. Given all of her ¡°firsts,¡± it was only fitting that Weber become the Forest Service¡¯s first female director of a research station. She headed west to California to lead the Pacific Southwest Research Station in . ?While there, Weber was well-liked by station staff and highly respected for her ability to build consensus. Beyond the science, Weber was instrumental in improving workplace diversity. A consent decree, which specified hiring goals and affirmative action requirements helped pave the way for more women to join the Forest Service in California.? Under Weber¡¯s leadership, the research station received the Chief¡¯s Multicultural Award in . Today, about a third of the Forest Service¡¯s 498 research scientists are women. In , Weber returned to Forest Service headquarters in Washington D.C. to become the associate deputy chief of Research, a position she held until her retirement in . ¡°Barbara broke new ground in everything she did,¡± said Northern Research Station Assistant Director Hao Tran, who worked with Weber from -. ¡°Someone had to pave the way¡ªand she did, in a very elegant and understated way.¡±  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Research and Science  Tags:  Forestry  FS  International Women's Day  Pacific Research Station  Science  Women's History Month",What are some ways to improve workplace diversity in agricultural research stations?,"According to the content, some ways to improve workplace diversity in agricultural research stations include: * Implementing consent decrees that specify hiring goals and affirmative action requirements * Setting aside time to discuss and address unequal treatment and biases, as Barbara C.

NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we'll feature the stories of America's Harvest Heroes?who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for. From laying the foundation for the next generation of farmers putting down roots in rural America, supporting the fruit and vegetable growers who are helping to build healthier communities, bolstering new markets for the products of agricultural innovation, to harvesting renewable energy that is made in Rural America, with USDA's support our farmers are yielding strong results for every American. For these reasons and more, America¡¯s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. Texas Producer Changes his Mind about Leaving the Farm Jonathan Cobb had made up his mind. He was leaving the farm. ¡°I was disillusioned with farming in general because we were just pushing long days and chasing acres and it didn¡¯t seem like there was very much reward,¡± Cobb said. ¡°That quality of life was not very good. My wife was having to work a lot of hours full time and really support the family. Twenty-five hundred acres really didn¡¯t support two families, and we weren¡¯t living extravagant lifestyles by any means.¡± Then came the drought of . ¡°I thought, maybe this is a sign from God ¨C maybe we shouldn¡¯t be farming. Maybe we should move on to something else,¡¯¡± Cobb said. ¡°I was looking into moving down to Austin, Texas and being involved in some urban farming setups.¡± In time, he and his wife Kaylyn put their house on the market and prepared to move, abandoning a century-old tradition of Cobb family farming. Using diverse cover crops and diverse animal grazing, the Cobbs are building soil health on their farm. Photo: Ron Nichols. Shortly after making that painful decision, Cobb¡¯s father asked him to stop by and review some soil test results that had just arrived at USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service¡¯s office in Temple, Texas. But before he could complete the chore, Cobb found himself ""trapped"" in a soil health workshop featuring NRCS¡¯ Ray Archuleta and Willie Durham. Too polite to leave, he took a seat on the front row. Within minutes, Cobb was entranced by what he was hearing from the presenters and the presentation he was seeing with his own eyes. What he heard that morning from the soil health presenters rekindled a passion and love that conventional agriculture had nearly extinguished. ¡°By the end of the day I knew I was going to stay and be a part of the paradigm shift.¡± Cobb said. Since that fateful day, the Cobb¡¯s have downsized their farm from 2,500 acres to 450 and transitioned from row crops to cover crops with multi-species livestock grazing systems. ¡°We planted over a thousand acres of cover crops the very next year, got rid of all of the tillage equipment, and just dove in,¡± he says.? Cobb admits his farming operation is still evolving, but improving soil health remains the central goal. ¡°One very high priority is to help with the soil and building up the soil and the carbon in the soil,¡± he says. ¡°We will probably make thousands of mistakes but we¡¯ll learn along the way.¡± Whatever happens, he says, ¡°The goal is to build the soil.¡± While Cobb¡¯s new business model hasn¡¯t fully evolved, he and his family are already reaping some of the intrinsic rewards he fondly remembered as a child growing up on the farm ¨C like enjoying the smell of blooming clover in the evening and watching the sun rise on a warm summer day. ¡°If we can make a living and stay here then we couldn¡¯t ask for anything more,¡± he says. The United Nations General Assembly has designated as the International Year of Soils. USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service was founded as a result of the Dust Bowl of the ¡¯s.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 30,   NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we¡¯ve been featuring the stories of America¡¯s Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for. From laying the foundation for the next generation of farmers putting down roots in rural America, supporting the fruit and vegetable growers who are helping to build healthier communities, bolstering new markets for the products of agricultural innovation, to harvesting renewable energy that is made in Rural America, with USDA¡¯s support our farmers are yielding strong results for every American. This blog focuses on two heroes of a different kind of harvest ¨C clean, renewable energy that is . I spent some time in Montana earlier this month to attend the Harvesting Clean Energy conference in Billings. We talked about options for continuing to support clean energy development, whether it's bio-based, geothermal, solar, or wind ¨C and how rural America fits in to the picture of clean energy development. Our Rural Energy for America Program was, unsurprisingly, a key focus by the participants. Having been reauthorized by the recent Farm Bill, Congress put REAP in a position to have very real impact on clean energy development in our rural communities. If properly leveraged with other programs, both private and public, and investment from the private sector ¨C the funding made available by Congress could conceivably have a billion-dollar impact on clean energy development in our nation. Red Lodge Ales owner Sam Hoffmann (middle) explains his brewery¡¯s thermal solar heating system to Montana State Director Janelle Gustafson (l) and Deputy Under Secretary Lillian Salerno (r). Hoffmann used the Rural Energy for America Program to purchase and install the thermal system. What strikes me the most is, how many of the projects to this point have been implemented. Rather than just the large complexes ¨C which certainly have their place in the overall picture ¨C rural America has responded by implementing small-scale projects, often at an individual business level, that have had noteworthy impact on the energy structure in their communities. While in Montana, I was able to see first-hand how these small scale projects have made a positive change on not just the carbon footprint and energy consumption of rural small businesses, but on their operational bottom line. I visited Red Lodge, Montana, a small community southwest of Billings that acts as a gateway in to Yellowstone National Park via the Beartooth Highway. Two particular businesses stood out for me, the Yodeler Motel, and Red Lodge Ales. Both companies had made investments in their businesses through the Rural Energy for America Program, and done so on a relatively small scale ¨C yet had seen a direct and positive impact on their operations due to the cost savings from the renewable energy sources. Harnessing the sun's radiant thermal energy to heat water, both the Yodeler and Red Lodge Ales have utilized the water in different ways to benefit their businesses. The Yodeler uses the heated water in their boiler to heat the rooms and common areas of the historic motel on the south end of Red Lodge. Mac Dean of the Yodeler Motel in Red Lodge, Mont. explains the thermal transfer system that supplies the motel's boiler with heated water, providing warmth to the Yodeler's rooms and common areas. Red Lodge Ales takes the pre-heated water, and superheats it to clean their brewing tanks, as well as maintain the necessary heat to brew their beer. It's a prime example of two different businesses using similar technology to harvest the abundant, clean, and free energy around us to benefit not only the businesses themselves ¨C and their bottom line ¨C but to benefit their community and the environment as a whole. I'm proud that USDA Rural Development could play a role in that.  Category/Topic:  Rural  Tags:  harvest heroes  Rural Development  Rural Energy for America Program","""What are some ways in which small-scale renewable energy projects can benefit rural businesses and communities?""","Implementing small-scale renewable energy projects, such as harnessing solar thermal energy to heat water, can have a direct and positive impact on rural businesses and communities by reducing their carbon footprint and energy consumption, while also providing cost savings that can be reinvested in the business. These projects can benefit individual businesses, such as breweries like Red Lodge Ales, and motels like the Yodeler Motel, by using pre-heated water to clean equipment or heat rooms, thereby improving operational efficiency and reducing expenses. Furthermore, these small-scale projects can contribute to the overall energy structure in rural communities, making them more sustainable and environmentally friendly."

"Deputy Secretary in  USDA Results  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Initiatives  Mar 08,  Rossie Fisher, co-owner of Brookview Farm in Manakin-Sabot, VA. March 8 is International Women's Day. Today, March 8th, is International Women¡¯s Day. What better day to recognize the incredible achievements of women in agriculture? Women have always played a key role on the farm or ranch. Traditionally, women often kept the books and ensured the solvency of the business while men ran the day-to-day production operation. That is still the case in many households, but these days, we are seeing more and more women take a lead role in farm operations as well. In ¨C the year of USDA¡¯s most recent agricultural census ¨C some 30 percent of farm operators in the U.S. were women. That¡¯s a 19 percent increase over the census. Fourteen percent of U.S. farms listed women as the principal operator in , meaning that women made the day-to-day decisions on the farm. (Women listed as farm operators, rather than principal operators, likely run the farm along with a partner or spouse). That¡¯s a 24 percent increase over . Individual states are showing even more involvement of women in farming. Arizona and New Hampshire have the greatest number of farms whose principal operator is a woman; one out of three New Hampshire farms is run by a woman, more than twice the national average. We know that American agriculture is constantly innovating to meet new demands. Women are part of a new wave of innovation in the industry. Women-operated farms tend to be very diverse, producing more vegetables, fruit and nuts, horticultural crops, poultry and sheep or goats than male-operated farms. They are also smaller on average, suggesting that they may engage in more direct-to-consumer sales or sell to local grocers, restaurants, or institutions. These strategies require new, creative business models and innovative production methods. And women are leading the way. As a historically disadvantaged group, women face unique challenges entering agriculture. I¡¯m proud of USDA¡¯s efforts to meet the needs of women farmers through training and business planning programs, mentorship opportunities, support for value-added product development, and our efforts to build strong local food systems through USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative. You can learn more about USDA¡¯s support for women in agriculture by searching for projects on the KYF Compass Map using the search term ¡°women.¡± Today, let¡¯s all take some time to thank women for their hard work on farms, ranches and in rural communities. They are contributing to the diverse leadership, diverse products and diverse market opportunities that will keep American agriculture strong and thriving long into the future.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Massachusetts in  Conservation  Oct 29,  Al Rose discusses his fourth-generation Red Apple ¡°green¡± Farm with NRCS¡¯ Soil Conservationist Dave Bacon. NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we'll feature the stories of America's Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for.

For these reasons and more, America¡¯s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. A towering, craggy McIntosh apple tree in the center of the orchard at Red Apple Farm in Phillipston, Massachusetts, has weathered 113 winters, borne many tons of crisp, tart apples and fed generations of customers. Planted in , it¡¯s the oldest commercially planted McIntosh tree in New England and possibly the country. Thanks to care by generations of the Rose family, that ancient apple tree still produces fruit today. Al Rose and his wife Nancy, who operate the fourth-generation farm, have introduced an innovative, modern growing system just a stone¡¯s throw from the century McIntosh. To ensure success in an area that sees its share of dry summers, the Roses sought the help of USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). ¡°It may be challenging, but I think we¡¯ve got a natural environment that¡¯s conducive to growing great apples,¡± said Al Rose. ¡°We have cold nights for a good part of the growing season, which are great for the color of the apples. Fall without apples in New England just wouldn¡¯t be the same.¡± A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ¡°We¡¯re at one of the highest elevations for orchards in New England ¨C 1,250 feet,¡± said Rose, standing in the orchard on a windy day. ¡°We have a wind turbine that¡¯s been cranking today. Between that and our solar panels, we¡¯re a red farm and a ¡®green¡¯ farm.¡± Red Apple Farm is protected under the state Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) program. ?Through a state grant program to help the viability of APR farms, Rose developed a business plan that called for planting an acre of trees in a new trellis system. ¡°We¡¯re not creating more land here; we have to be more productive on the land that we do have,¡± explained Rose. The ¡°fruit wall¡± is small trees, shallow-rooted and spaced as close as a foot apart. ¡°It¡¯s the most productive way and, from a cost standpoint, it¡¯s easier to maintain,¡± said Rose. ¡°But, to do that, you have to have a pond in place.¡± So, Rose reached out to NRCS for help with irrigation. ¡°I know they have the technical expertise to do it right and give us advice,¡± said Rose, who also got financial help through the federal Agricultural Management Assistance (AMA) program. Dave Bacon, NRCS Soil Conservationist, has been assisting Red Apple Farm for more than a decade. He explained that, in Massachusetts, the AMA program is used for drought mitigation. ¡°We didn¡¯t want to have an acre¡¯s worth of apple trees fail because there was no irrigation water available,¡± said Bacon. Al Rose stands near the McIntosh tree, planted in . Bacon explained that soil indicated that there was adequate ground water to create a pond, a more reliable water source than drilling a well. With well drilling, there is a risk that there won¡¯t be enough water to meet the plants¡¯ needs.? A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ¡°As we slowly change to the newer high production, higher density plantings, it¡¯s going to make us a lot more successful for the current generation and future generations,¡± said Rose. ¡°If you want to do something right, get the experts involved,¡± said Rose.? ¡°NRCS has experts; they know how to do it and they know how to do it right. You¡¯re going to get great advice and great people are there to support you.¡±  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  apple orchard  Conservation  harvest heroes  NRCS","What innovative water conservation method did the Red Apple Farm in Massachusetts use to support their apple tree growth, and how did it improve their productivity?","The Red Apple Farm in Massachusetts used a micro-irrigation system, which delivers water from a pond directly to the young trees.

"Associate Deputy Administrator for APHIS Animal Care in  Animals  Plants  Jul 14,  Dr. Morgan, pictured here with her horse, Belle, knew at a young age that she wanted to be a veterinarian when, on a road trip with her parents, she saw the horses in Louisville and Lexington. Hello, I¡¯m Dr. Andrea (Andy) Morgan, Associate Deputy Administrator of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)¡¯s Animal Care (AC) program. In , when I hadn¡¯t been out of vet school long and was working at a small animal practice, I got ahold of a brochure about APHIS¡¯ Public Veterinary Practice Career Program. I was interested in working not just with small animals but with other animals, too¡ªexotic animals and horses, to name a few. So I joined APHIS that year, and here I am, still working for the agency 26 years and many important experiences later. My current position involves a lot of strategic planning and working within the program to find ways USDA can be more effective with Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act inspections. Before I joined the AC program, I held a number of positions in APHIS¡¯ Veterinary Services. I served as National Incident Commander for the U.S. response to an Exotic Newcastle Disease outbreak and National Coordinator for the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance program. The most memorable experience I¡¯ve had at APHIS was ensuring the U.S. Equestrian Team horses could travel to the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. An unidentified equine illness hit New England that year before all of the ates. The European Union (EU) Commission wanted to ban the entry of all U.S. horses into EU Member States. I was a staff vet with APHIS¡¯ National Center for Import/Export, and I had to assure the EU that none of the Equestrian Team horses had been affected by the outbreak. Dr. Morgan shares her insights and perspectives with APHIS employees. For several hours, my EU counterpart Dr. Bernard Van Goethem and I were on the phone and faxing proposals back and forth. Keep in mind this was before e-mail was widely used. We were just two vets, hashing it out across the ocean. Dr. Van Goethem would share the proposals with EU Member States¡¯ Chief Veterinary Officers and get back to me. Eventually, we all agreed on a proposal. I was especially glad to learn that Irish, one of the horses that wouldn¡¯t have made it to Spain without those efforts, won the Olympic bronze medal in show jumping. It¡¯s the coolest thing to negotiate on behalf of the United States, or to make things happen in any number of ways when there¡¯s a problem to solve. Are there challenges when working as a public veterinarian? Always. But it¡¯s like swimming¡ªthere are no standard operating procedures¡ªyou have to just dive in. I¡¯ve learned a lot about myself and my core values in my time at APHIS. This is my legacy.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  Feb 01,  Apollo the tiger after being confiscated by APHIS Each year, APHIS protects millions of animals nationwide that are covered by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).? The Act, and accompanying regulations developed by APHIS, set Federal standards of care for animals that are bred at the wholesale level, used in research, transported commercially, or exhibited to the public.? Under the law, APHIS has the authority and obligation to confiscate any AWA-regulated animal that is in a condition of unrelieved suffering. When APHIS inspectors identify a suffering animal, they intervene quickly on its behalf and make sure the animal gets the care it needs.? First, inspectors will clearly explain to the owner what needs to be done, such as requiring the facility¡¯s veterinarian to tend to an injury or health issue, and then set a short deadline ¡ª usually 24 hours ¡ª for when corrective action must be taken. ?Under the AWA, if proper care is not provided by the deadline, APHIS must ensure that the animal is taken to a facility where it will receive humane care according to Federal standards.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 26,  The National Potato Board¡¯s efforts to increase economic growth and market viability for American potato farmers have had an impact on the industry. In , U.S. potato exports were a record $1.6 billion. America's ag promotion groups work to educate consumers, as well as research and promote our nation¡¯s agricultural products. Whether potatoes or pork, mangos or cotton, soybeans or almonds, ag promotion groups help consumers make informed choices and learn about new products. Although all ag promotion groups do have a similar goal and purpose ¨C to pool their resources to increase demand and long-term economic growth for their? industries ¨C they all accomplish this in different ways, tailoring their efforts to apply strategies that work best for each commodity. The United States Potato Board (USPB) is one of several national ag promotion groups operating under the oversight of USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).? They are the central organizing force in implementing programs that increase demand for potatoes at home and abroad. This group provides the ideas, information, tools and inspiration for the industry to unite in achieving common goals. Anchored by a strong foundation of market and consumer research and analysis, the USPB domestic and international potato marketing programs include:?advertising, nutrition science, public relations, retail and foodservice marketing, and issues management.?Whether the potato is grown for fresh, frozen, chip, dehydrated or seed use, the USPB is dedicated to positioning potatoes as a nutrition powerhouse¡ªtruly, goodness unearthed.? And all of these efforts mean more economic growth and market viability for American potato farmers. For Fiscal Year (July ¨C June ), U.S. potato exports were a record $1.6 billion, an increase of 4% over FY12 The volume of exports increased 4% to 1,561,896 metric tons, or 66 million hundredweight at the fresh weight equivalent The volume of U.S. exports has increased 26% over the past five marketing years, led by a 62% increase in fresh, a 36% increase in dehydrated and a 17% increase in frozen For the first six months of FY14, the volume of exports of frozen products is up 2%, dehydrated is up 10% and fresh is up 2% The National Mango Board¡¯s (NMB) mission is to increase the demand for fresh mangos in the U.S. by conducting promotion, market and production research. The NMB accomplishes this through three core programs: marketing, research and industry relations. Understanding consumer purchasing behaviors is key to increasing mango consumption in the U.S. The NMB conducts ongoing consumer research to explore consumer awareness, knowledge about mangos, buying habits, barriers to purchase and many other facets of consumer attitudes relative to mangos. ?Results from their consumer research help create, support and guide marketing efforts and messages to increase mango demand. Demand is the most direct and practical way to monitor consumer purchasing behavior since it reflects all of the conditions impacting buying decisions. Most of the changes in the demand for mangos come from attracting new households to buy (market penetration) and far less in changing the number of mangos purchased (market intensity) per buyer. With NMB programs, market penetration increased from under 3% in to over 13% in . Mango availability per capita has increased 53% since to an estimated 2.87 pounds per year in . This means that increased mango sales are related to more consumers perceiving mangos as an option, and much of this is due to NMB¡¯s work.? Through market penetration more consumers are likely to make mangos a routine part of their diets.? By providing promotional information to increase consumer awareness of the fruit, NMB¡¯s efforts convince more potential customers to give them a try. Whether engaging in consumer research, nutrition education or advertising, ag promotion groups help America¡¯s farmers and agribusinesses navigate through marketing challenges, opening doors to new markets and broadening our food options.

In the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico, lies Alturas de Casta?er, a small, mountainous community that is home to 24 agricultores and their families. The agricultores - or farm workers - work hard year-round to produce coffee, bananas, root vegetables and citrus fruits that are then sold in local markets and to area restaurants. Before coming to the community of Alturas de Casta?er, many families lived in cramped conditions, sometimes with two or three other families.? Conditions were unsanitary and children were constantly sick.? Some homes did not even have roofs, and residents suffered dangerous exposure to the natural elements, including torrential rains during hurricane season. Alturas de Casta?er resident Maria Rodriguez and her husband recall renting a house that they could barely afford. The home was in disrepair, they had to use a ladder as a makeshift set of front steps to their home, and finding snakes and rats in their living space was commonplace. With the help of USDA Rural Development's Farm Labor Housing Program, the Municipality of Lares was able to build an affordable 24-home rental community, Alturas de Casta?er, dedicated solely to farm workers and their families. After moving into this community, living conditions improved dramatically for many residents. Residents like Jomar, an agricultor who uses a wheelchair for mobility; the closets and kitchen in his Alturas de Casta?er home were built for wheelchair accessibility. The community is quiet and clean, the children of the farm workers have a safe place to play, and the homes are well maintained by an experienced management company. It's affordable, too; farm workers living in this community are only to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent. Built in , Alturas de Casta?er was a product of a partnership between USDA Rural Development, Rural Opportunities Puerto Rico, Inc. (ROPRI), an affiliate of PathStone, the Puerto Rico Department of Housing, and the Federal Home Loan Bank. USDA and ROPRI have realized the success of the investment despite the significant challenges in planning and building a community in rural Puerto Rico. USDA and its partners are now looking forward to the development of self-sustaining community gardens which will also support a summer food program for children.

Los agricultores trabajan arduamente durante todo el a?o para producir caf¨¦, pl¨¢tanos, viandas y frutas c¨ªtricas que luego se venden en los mercados locales y a los restaurantes en la zona. Antes de llegar a la comunidad de Alturas de Casta?er, muchas familias viv¨ªan en espacios estrechos, a veces con dos o tres otras familias. Las condiciones eran insalubres y los ni?os estaban constantemente enfermos. Algunos hogares ni siquiera ten¨ªan techo y los residentes estaban peligrosamente expuestos a los elementos de la naturaleza, como las lluvias torrenciales durante la temporada de huracanes. Maria Rodriguez y su esposo, residentes de Alturas de Casta?er, recuerdan haber alquilado una casa que apenas pod¨ªan pagar. La casa estaba en mal estado, tuvieron que usar una escalera como escalones improvisados en la entrada de la casa y era com¨²n encontrar culebras y ratas dentro de la casa. Con la ayuda del Programa de Vivienda para Trabajadores Agr¨ªcolas de la Oficina de Desarrollo Rural de USDA, el municipio de Lares pudo construir Alturas de Casta?er, una comunidad de 24 viviendas de bajo costo para alquiler, destinada ¨²nicamente para los trabajadores agr¨ªcolas y sus familias. Luego de mudarse a esta comunidad, las condiciones de vida mejoraron dram¨¢ticamente para muchos residentes. Residentes como Jomar, un agricultor que usa silla de ruedas para desplazarse; los armarios y la cocina en su hogar en Alturas de Casta?er fueron dise?ados para que tuviera acceso en su silla de ruedas. La comunidad es tranquila y limpia, los hijos de los trabajadores agr¨ªcolas tienen un lugar seguro donde jugar y los hogares est¨¢n bien mantenidos por una compa?¨ªa de administraci¨®n experimentada. Adem¨¢s, es una comunidad econ¨®mica; los trabajadores agr¨ªcolas que viven aqu¨ª solo tienen que pagar el 30% de su ingreso para el alquiler. Construida en el , Alturas de Casta?er fue el resultado de una alianza entre la Oficina de Desarrollo Rural de USDA, Rural Opportunities Puerto Rico, Inc. (ROPRI), una afiliada de PathStone, el Departamento de Vivienda de Puerto Rico y el Banco Federal de Pr¨¦stamos para Vivienda (Federal Home Loan Bank). USDA y ROPRI lograron el ¨¦xito de la inversi¨®n a pesar de los retos significativos para planificar y construir una comunidad en la zona rural de rural Puerto Rico. USDA y sus socios esperan desarrollar jardines comunitarios autosuficientes que tambi¨¦n apoyar¨¢n un programa de alimentos para ni?os durante el verano. Una inversi¨®n como la de Alturas de Casta?er, la ¨²nica de su tipo en Puerto Rico, nos ayuda a darnos cuenta de que es posible un futuro mejor para los puertorrique?os que viven en las zonas rurales. La Oficina de Desarrollo Rural de USDA est¨¢ colaborando con los desarrolladores comunitarios y defensores de vivienda econ¨®mica para crear m¨¢s comunidades destinadas a los agricultores esenciales de Puerto Rico.

"USDA Nebraska Public Information Officer in  Rural  Mar 12,  Donald Parkos on porch of his new home, funded in part through USDA. The Norfolk, Nebraska Area Habitat for Humanity (NAHFH) wanted to expand the impact of its home construction program, and get a more immediate return on investment so it could help the greatest number of people in need. USDA Rural Development was the agency NAHFH felt was best met that need. NAHFH utilized a community revitalization grant administered by the Northeast Nebraska Economic Development District (NENEDD), managed by Northeast Economic Development, Inc. (NED, Inc.) to demolish the dilapidated property that previously existed on the lot site.? The new construction was completed through donations of supplies and expertise, sweat equity and primarily through the building trades program at Northeast Community College. USDA Rural Development worked with Donald Parkos, the potential homebuyer, throughout the application process.? USDA Rural Development provided the first mortgage for him to purchase the home.? In addition to this, Parkos received down payment assistance.? Through the hard work of a number of partners, Donald was able to afford a newly built home for less than $100,000.? Today he resides in his 1,100 square foot, two bedroom, one bath home. The partnership had an impact far beyond that of just homeownership. The process helped revitalize a neighborhood by placing a nice, newly built home where a dilapidated structure once stood. It also helped create a sense of community and ownership in the neighborhood by all involved.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Food and Nutrition  May 16,  Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ¡°organic¡± really means can help consumers make informed choices. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ¡°Made with organic oats and cranberries.¡± A more generic statement like, ¡°Made with organic ingredients,¡± is not allowed. This is the sixteenth installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Deciphering food labels and marketing claims can be a challenge for the average consumer.? Companies use production and handling claims as a way to differentiate their products in the marketplace. Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ¡°organic¡± really means can help consumers make informed choices. USDA certified organic products have strict production and labeling requirements. ?The U.S. organic industry is regulated by the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service.? Certified organic products are produced without excluded methods such as genetic engineering or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). ?The organic standards are designed to allow natural substances in organic farming while prohibiting synthetic substances. There are four distinct labeling categories for certified organic food products ¨C 100% Organic, Organic, Made with organic ***, and specific organic ingredients.? There are also labeling requirements for organic livestock feed. Today, I wanted to talk more about the ¡°Made with organic***¡± category. Multi-ingredient agricultural products in the ¡°Made with organic ***¡± category must contain at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients (not including salt or water).? These products may contain up to 30 percent of allowed non-organic ingredients. ?All ingredients ¨C including the 30 percent non-organic ingredients ¨C must be produced without GMOs. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ¡°Made with organic oats and cranberries.¡±? A more generic statement like, ¡°Made with organic ingredients,¡± is not allowed. If an ingredient is identified in the ¡°Made with organic ***¡± statement, it must be a truthful claim. This means the product can only contain organic forms of that specific ingredient.?? For example, if the label states ¡°Made with organic corn¡± all raw and processed corn-based ingredients¡ªsuch as blue corn, corn oil, and corn starch¡ªmust be certified organic. The USDA organic regulations provide a set list of ¡°food groups.¡± All raw and processed forms of ingredients in that food group must be certified organic. For example, if a product states, ¡°Made with organic grains,¡± all ingredients derived from grains¡ªsuch as enriched wheat flour, corn oil, or oats¡ªmust be certified organic.? If a product contains both organic and non-organic forms of the same ingredient, they must be identified separately in the ingredient statement. ¡°Made with organic***¡± products can¡¯t use the USDA organic seal, but must identify the USDA-accredited certifying agent. You can look for the identity of the certifier on a packaged product for verification that the product meets USDA¡¯s organic standards.? Certifying agents are accredited by the USDA, and are responsible for ensuring that the USDA organic products meet or exceed all organic standards. The NOP recently put out final guidance on this labeling category to ensure consistency in labeling practices throughout the organic industry.? Consumers purchase organic products expecting that they maintain their organic integrity from farm to market, and USDA is committed to meeting these expectations.? Or, as we like to say at NOP, ¡°organic integrity from farm to table, consumers trust the organic label.¡±  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Tags:  AMS  Certification  farming  food labels  GMO  handling  National Organic Program  NOP  organic  Organic 101  organic certification  Organic Literacy Initiative  USDA Organic",What percentage of non-organic ingredients can an agricultural product contain while still being labeled as "Made with organic***"?,Up to 30 percent.

"USDA Marketing Order Provides Ingredients for Olive Industry's Success  Each industry has its own recipe for success. For the ripe olive industry, the recipe for success includes many ingredients. This includes a commitment to consistency, marketing, and research. These factors help the nearly 1,000 family farms from California supply 95 percent of the ripe olives grown in the U.S. The USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) provides the ripe olive industry many of the ingredients for its success. One of the ways we do this is by overseeing the federal marketing order for olives grown in California, which is administered locally by the California Olive Committee. Federal marketing orders and agreements are requested by various groups in the U.S. produce industry to help growers and handlers within a geographic region to overcome marketing barriers and increase awareness of the commodity.

Fortunately, Experimental Forests and Rangelands offer access to natural testing grounds for exploring puzzling forest and range management issues, such as how to contend with invasive species, wildfire and climate change. The educational materials from Experimental Forests and Rangelands provide a window into some of the research that these sites make possible. Spanning ates, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, they offer an unparalleled opportunity to view local, regional and national environmental change at the continental scale. Besides their comprehensive scope and stunning diversity, another distinguishing feature of Experimental Forests and Rangelands, is the long-term nature of their mission. Some collection efforts stretch back more than 100 years and others are projected to continue for another two centuries. The value of this information is immense, as there are very few comparable opportunities to capture long-term changes on forests and rangelands. Until a few decades ago, scientists and managers could not have predicted they would need to understand the effects of a changing climate on our natural resources. Fortunately, we have the long-term records from Experimental Forests and Rangelands.

"Economist at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 13,  Families Projected to Spend an Average of $233,610 Raising a Child Born in . USDA recently issued Expenditures on Children by Families, . This report is also known as ¡°The Cost of Raising a Child.¡± USDA has been tracking the cost of raising a child since and this analysis examines expenses by age of child, household income, budgetary component, and region of the country. Based on the most recent from the Consumer Expenditures Survey, in , a family will spend approximately $12,980 annually per child in a middle-income ($59,200-$107,400), two-child, married-couple family. Middle-income, married-couple parents of a child born in may expect to spend $233,610 ($284,570 if projected inflation costs are factored in*) for food, shelter, and other necessities to raise a child through age 17. This does not include the cost of a college education. Where does the money go? For a middle-income family, housing accounts for the largest share at 29% of total child-rearing costs.? Food is second at 18%, and child care/education (for those with the expense) is third at 16%. Expenses vary depending on the age of the child. As families often need more room to accommodate children, housing is the largest expense. We did the analysis by household income level, age of the child, and region of residence. Not surprising, the higher a family¡¯s income the more was spent on a child, particularly for child care/education and miscellaneous expenses. Expenses also increase as a child ages.? Overall annual expenses averaged about $300 less for children from birth to 2 years old, and averaged $900 more for teenagers between 15-17 years of age. Teenagers have higher food costs as well as higher transportation costs as these are the years they start to drive so insurance is included or a maybe a second car is purchased for them. Regional variation was also observed. Families in the urban Northeast spent the most on a child, followed by families in the urban West, urban South, and urban Midwest.? Families in rural areas throughout the country spent the least on a child¡ªchild-rearing expenses were 27% lower in rural areas than the urban Northeast, primarily due to lower housing and child care/education expenses. Child-rearing expenses are subject to economies of scale. That is, with each additional child, expenses on each declines. For married-couple families with one child, expenses averaged 27% more per child than expenses in a two-child family.? For families with three or more children, per child expenses averaged 24% less on each child than on a child in a two-child family.? This is sometimes referred to as the ¡°cheaper by the dozen¡± effect. Each additional child costs less because children can share a bedroom; a family can buy food in larger, more economical quantities; clothing and toys can be handed down; and older children can often babysit younger ones. Food costs have decreased over the years thanks to increased efficiency in American agriculture. This report is one of many ways that USDA works to support American families through our programs and work. It outlines typical spending by families from across the country, and is used in a number of ways to help support and education American families.? Courts and state governments use this to inform their decisions about child support and foster care payments.? Financial planners use the information to provide advice to their clients, and families can access our Cost of Raising a Child calculator, which we update with every report on our website, to look at spending patterns for families similar to theirs. This Calculator is one of many tools available on MyMoney.gov, a government research and clearinghouse related to financial education.

"Director, National Grain Center, GIPSA in  Research and Science  Oct 29,  Sec. Tom Vilsack visited the grain grading laboratory of GIPSA's Board of Appeals and Review (BAR) and the Grading Service Laboratory (GSL) on October 23, . BAR staff explain their grading review process while BAR Chairman Jim Whalen looks on. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration¡¯s (GIPSA) National Grain Center (NGC) was proud to host Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Wednesday, October 23.? The NGC, located in Kansas City, MO, is home to the Federal Grain Inspection Service¡¯s (FGIS) Technology and Science Division along with staff from FGIS¡¯ Quality Assurance and Compliance Division and Field Management Division. The grain inspectors, scientists and engineers at the NGC provide a broad spectrum of grain inspection services and support within recently renovated state of the art laboratories.?? During the visit, NGC staff demonstrated how they oversee, develop and approve methods and instruments used for grain inspection that ensure the consistent standard of measuring quality essential to grain marketing. Members of the Board of Appeals and Review (BAR) and the Grading Services Laboratory (GSL) described their critical role within the grain inspection process.? When a grain quality factor is measured through sensory evaluation ¨C how the grain looks or smells ¨C all grain inspectors looking at and smelling the grain sample must be looking for exactly the same thing. Tom Weber, Leader of GIPSA's Trace Analysis Laboratory, explains the process of preparing and testing grain samples for the presence of pesticide residues as Dr. Tim Norden, Chief of GIPSA's Analytical Chemistry Branch, and Mary Alonzo, Director of GIPSA's Technology and Science Division, watch. The BAR¡¯s experienced eyes and noses establish the point where a quality factor impacts a grain sample¡¯s overall grade.? The GSL monitors the accuracy of individual grain inspection results while the BAR monitors the overall grain inspection results against the BAR¡¯s standard of performance.? Both resolve appeals of grain inspection results determined at the initial point of inspection.? The BAR¡¯s interpretation is USDA¡¯s final and binding determination. Equating the process to finding a needle in a haystack, Dr. Tim Norden described how specialized instruments allow his team to analyze grain samples for trace amounts of pesticides and mycotoxins. The results are often used to confirm that U.S. grain meets international limits for these harmful chemicals.? Dr. Norden also emphasized that evolving technology requires that his staff and laboratory constantly maintain their skills. The NGC¡¯s Biotechnology Laboratory develops and validates methods to identify genetic events in grain.? Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief, Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discussed the multi-step process used by her team.? Dr. Bell also emphasized the collaborative nature of biotechnology methods development.? GIPSA¡¯s Biotechnology Proficiency Program, now in its tenth year, collaborates with over 200 laboratories around the world to ensure their ability to accurately detect genetic events.? GIPSA also works closely with other USDA agencies with biotechnology programs. Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief of GIPSA's Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discusses with Secretary Vilsack GIPSA's role in supporting agricultural biotechnology.  Test weight and moisture are the most commonly measured quality factors in all types of grain.???FGIS has developed a prototype for a training tool to improve inspector skills. Secretary Vilsack was able to see that technique does indeed make a difference while trying out a test weight trainer being developed by FGIS.? The test weight trainer measures a grain inspector¡¯s strike off technique against the approved standard.? New and experienced grain inspectors can use it to perfect their technique on this critical measurement. FGIS approved two instruments to measure moisture in all officially graded commodities over the past year.? The Unified Grain Moisture Algorithm (UGMA)-Compatible moisture meters offer improved performance under a wider range of conditions.? Dr. Dave Funk, GIPSA¡¯s Chief Scientist, developed the UGMA algorithm that is the basis of the measurement process of the new meters.? Dr. Funk recounted the development process, and demonstrated how the two machines offer equivalent results. The renovated NGC enhances GIPSA¡¯s ability to certify the accuracy and stability of instruments that measure various quality factors in grain. We all thank Secretary Vilsack for allowing us to show him how the NGC and FGIS support U.S. agriculture. TSD engineer Jason Jordon demonstrated to Secretary Vilsack the proper method for leveling off grain in the kettle used to measure test weight.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  May 14,  Organic certification cost share programs puts organic certification within reach for farms of all sizes. It is of great value to organic farmers and supports the integrity of the organic label. Consumers are increasingly looking for organic products when they visit the supermarket.? Last year, organic products reached a record number of sales, accounting for over $39 billion in U.S. retail sales.? To meet consumer demand, the industry needs more organic operations to produce everything from organic milk to organic granola bars.? Thanks to support from the Farm Bill, USDA has two cost share programs that assist organic farms and businesses with about $11 million per year in certification assistance¨C making it possible for producers and handlers of all sizes to consider organic certification.? Cost share programs support certified operations across the organic supply chain by making certification more affordable. The USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers these programs through grants to participating states. In , USDA funding allowed states to issue nearly 10,000 reimbursements worth more than $6 million, helping the organic community thrive and grow.? ""The U.S. is currently experiencing an explosion of demand for certified organic products and our goal is to see that demand is met by U.S. farmers,¡± said Abby Youngblood, Executive Director of the National Organic Coalition.? ¡°We expect that the organic cost share programs will encourage more U.S. farms to certify and/or add another certification scope to meet this demand."" Cost share programs cover a wide range of certification-related expenses, and cover 75 percent of the cost of each certification, up to a maximum of $750 annually. Here¡¯s how it works: If you¡¯re not yet certified, contact a certifier and get certified. If you are already a certified operation, contact your state agency; Submit your information ¨C a short application and tax form, proof of certification, and itemized expenses; and Get reimbursed by your state agency. ¡°As a small seed company, the cost share program helped make becoming certified organic a reality for us,¡±?said Ken Greene, Founder of the Hudson Valley Seed Library. ¡°We are proud of our certification, what it means about our seeds, and are committed to increasing the diversity and availability of certified organic seed for organic growers.¡± Organic certification lets consumers know that the products they buy meet the USDA organic requirements.?

"Kentucky State Director in  Rural  Jun 09,  Tex Peyton's new home is shown under construction next to the old one. USDA celebrates National Homeownership Month each year in June, and we continue to shine the spotlight on projects across the nation. I wanted to illustrate the work we do to provide ladders of opportunity for rural residents who might not have such an opportunity without the support of USDA Rural Development. I had the pleasure of meeting one such person this week. His name is Tex Peyton and for the past 18 years he lived in a basic two-room house in Eastern Kentucky that lacked indoor plumbing. Thanks to a team of partners that includes USDA Rural Development, Habitat for Humanity, Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and Columbia Pipeline, Peyton now has an affordable energy-efficient house that he is proud to call home ¨C in the community where he grew up in West Liberty. Habitat for Humanity provided the labor to build the home while USDA, along with our partners at Columbia Pipeline and Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, provided the financing for Peyton to purchase it. The house is incredibly energy-efficient and features a Lennox mini-split HVAC system, low e-argon windows and above-standard insulation in the walls, ceiling and floors ¨C building components that will significantly reduce the monthly cost of heating and cooling the home. Persistent poverty counties in Kentucky, like Morgan County where Peyton lives, face challenges that are unique to rural communities. They are often geographically isolated, lack educational opportunities, have high rates of unemployment and are usually underserved ¨C qualities that impede economic opportunity and reduce quality of life. USDA places special emphasis on persistent poverty counties and utilizes a strategy of partnering public resources with local expertise to grow rural economies and create jobs in these poverty-stricken areas.

"AMS National Organic Program Deputy Director in  Conservation  Jul 30,  To protect the integrity of the organic industry and its products, farms must certify that their operations are following USDA organic regulations. The USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service offers farms resources to help offset the certification costs. This is the seventh installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Annual organic certification fees allow certifiers to carry out their responsibilities. These fees vary according to an operation¡¯s size and other variables. In light of that, the USDA organic cost share programs help to ensure that these costs don¡¯t discourage those wanting to pursue organic certification. The programs make certification more affordable by reimbursing producers and handlers for as much as 75%¡ªup to a maximum of $750 a year¡ªfor their certification costs. Eligible costs include application fees, inspection fees, travel for certification inspectors, and even postage. ¡°After I figured out how to apply, I found it to be easy,¡± said Gary Philbrick of Philbrick Farms, a Paso Robles, Calif., organization that is certified to produce walnuts. ¡°I just save my receipts and fill out the necessary form and send it in [to the state].¡± State governments administer the organic cost-share funds, appropriated by Congress under the Farm Bill. State governments, usually Departments of Agriculture, work with USDA to administer the program and distribute funds to growers, ranchers, and handlers that are currently certified to the USDA organic regulations. Applicants submit a short form along with proof of certification and an itemized invoice to their state agencies. The state verifies these applications before disbursing funds to eligible organic operations. The program is not competitive, so anyone who is eligible may apply for a reimbursement. ¡°I¡¯m a small farmer, and this program helps me a lot,¡± said Nancy Abramson of Rooster Ridge Farm, a 20-acre operation that devotes one-fifth of its acreage to growing everything from organic citrus to flowers to herbs. ¡°In the beginning, I had a huge fee [getting certified], but the cost share gave me two-thirds of it back. The paperwork is nothing. I think the program is fantastic, and it makes organic farming very affordable for small farmers.¡± Philbrick Farms, based in Paso Robles, Calif., harvests its certified organic walnuts in the fall. With the help of a shaker truck, walnuts fall to the ground and are collected to be sent to the processor for further handling. In particular, smaller operations like Philbrick Farms benefit from USDA¡¯s organic cost share programs, which reimburse producers for as much as 75% of their certification fees. Photo courtesy of Philbrick Farms. When it comes to organic certification, there are many things small growers or handlers have to consider. Affordability is important and often at the top of the list. Organic certification not only fulfills a desired method of farming, but also meets the increased consumer demand for foods farmed and handled organically. ¡°It¡¯s a huge benefit for me that I can advertise that I¡¯m certified organic,¡± said Abramson. ¡°There¡¯s such a marketing plus, and it gets [my product] into grocery stores that require me to be organic.¡± In addition to stocking grocery stores, Abramson takes pride in being able to market her products as organic when selling to consumers at the local farmers market and to the restaurants near her Santa Cruz operation. They all appreciate her organic spinach. The organic cost share program is one of many programs that USDA offers to support emerging, transitioning, or current organic growers and handlers.

"NRCS Oregon in  Conservation  Jan 18,  Sarahlee Lawrence inspects a row of organically grown flowers on her organic farm in the high desert of Central Oregon. Business is blooming for Sarahlee Lawrence and her organic food-and-flower-growing operation, Rainshadow Organics, in the Central Oregon high desert. The 28-year old organic pioneer is proud of her venture and credits USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a key component to her success. Lawrence approached NRCS several years ago to start the process of making her farm organic. NRCS helped her plan and implement a nutrient management program and address irrigation issues on both a two-acre vegetable-and-flower plot and a 25-acre field where she grows a mix of cover crops like wheat and clover. NRCS provided assistance to Lawrence through two Farm Bill programs. The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) Organic Initiative is a nationwide special effort to provide financial assistance to National Organic Program (NOP) certified organic producers, as well as producers in the process of transitioning to organic production. And the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) is a cooperative program to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Drip irrigation system made possible by the NRCS Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP). Lawrence is especially pleased with the newly installed drip irrigation system that supplies water to more than 100 varieties of produce and a colorful assortment of flowers on her two-acre parcel. ¡°I could not have afforded or done that by myself,¡± she explains. To be certified organic, a U.S. agricultural operation has to be approved by a USDA Accredited Certifying Agent. Applicants must comply with USDA Organic regulations and submit documentation on their property and farming practices. Transitioning to organic is often a lengthy process, as Lawrence knows. Fields may require preparation to support organic production, including the planting of cover crops, incorporating compost and other soil-enhancing practices. While it takes a while to transition an operation to a Certified Organic one, Lawrence is pleased with her progress. The market for fresh, locally grown food continues to expand in Central Oregon, and her customers include a local hospital, schools and restaurants. Over 100 different types produce are grown on this two-acre organic operation, ranging from beets and beans to cabbage and strawberries. She has also generated a new, dedicated client base through community supported agriculture (CSA). CSA is a way for consumers to directly invest in local farms and receive a regular delivery of fresh fruits, vegetables and other local products. Lawrence looks forward to a bright, rewarding and sustainable future. Find out more about the EQIP Organic Initiative. Check out more conservation stories on the USDA blog. Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"Writer, Analytics Center of Excellence, Office of the Chief Information Officer in  Technology  Jun 17,  Hackathon participants use sensors and robotics to create solutions with USDA . Photo credit: BeMyApp The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently took another step forward on its path to accelerate information technology (IT) modernization and improve how it designs agricultural services and interacts with agricultural producers. This spring, USDA joined technical experts, IT professionals, and application developers for the first hackathon at the Internet of Things (IoT) World Conference in Santa Clara, California. Working collaboratively, the hackathon teams developed new solutions to challenging issues affecting agriculture. What are Hackathons? Hackathons are typically multi-day events where programmers and designers engage in collaborative computer programming. ¡°The goal is not gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, or to necessarily produce a completely polished product,¡± said Andrew Brown, Soil Scientist at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and mentor at the hackathon. ¡°Rather, hackathons focus on innovation, collaboration, and rapid application development.¡± The hackathon was a fitting channel to address key challenges the USDA is working to solve. ¡°Hackathons are a great way to spur innovation and have the potential to solve real issues,¡± said Ted Kaouk, Chief Officer (CDO) for USDA¡¯s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). ¡°Farmers and ranchers are using from satellites, weather forecasts, sensors, and other technology for more precise agriculture, which is helping to improve agricultural processes on their operation while increasing profits and providing even better protection to the environment.¡± USDA employees supported the hackathon by serving as judges and mentors for the competition. Inside the Hackathon Hackathon participants were challenged to use USDA¡¯s soil, geospatial, and water forecasting to develop IT products that addressed access to water resources and wise water use to support the sustainability, growth, and viability of agriculture. They were to consider the following in their solutions: limited use of broadband in the rural U.S., cybersecurity, and applying machine learning models to make -driven decisions. The hackathon event was preceded by a discovery interlude where participants explored water challenges in agriculture and brainstormed ideas on possible solutions given their shared knowledge of the domain, technology, , and other areas. A webinar one week prior to the event provided an overview of the hackathon and discussion of the datasets, and messaging application, Slack, was used where USDA mentors could answer questions regarding USDA , tools, and resources. The hackathon was a two-day event that included participation from eight teams ranging from two to seven people. During the event, each team gathered around a table to devise a solution while mentors walked around the room to check in, ask questions, and provide guidance. ¡°Mentors worked one-on-one with hackathon participants to help them conceptualize the challenge and apply the datasets,¡± said Brown. ¡°Most participants had an approach in mind and a general goal and needed help with conceptual aspects of interpreting the . Agricultural production systems have fundamental limits and unique considerations that make subject matter expert input very valuable. The mentor cadre¡¯s practical experience in agriculture and environmental problems was critical to helping teams keep their solutions in the realm of possibility.¡± By 1:00 p.m. on the second day, all code needed to be completed. In the afternoon, each team had three minutes to ¡°pitch¡± their solution. Of the eight groups that were formed, three finalists were selected to present their solutions on stage at the ¡°EcoCenter System Stage¡± located on the Expo Center floor. After the judges reviewed the presentations, Carlos Suarez, NRCS State Conservationist for California, announced ¡°Team Smart Ag¡± as the winner and presented them with the hackathon trophy. Team Smart Ag¡¯s Winning Solution Team Smart Ag developed a low-cost, low-power smart-farming solution that would enable farmers to use devices to monitor a variety of conditions, such as water needs for crops and livestock health. The open-source, conversational artificial intelligence (AI) platform includes a phone application that allows farmers to ask questions, such as ¡°Where do I need to water today?¡±. Team Smart Ag also created a 3D visualization of a hypothetical farm to provide a first-person view of the land, so farmers can locate runoff and areas that need water. In addition to winning the hackathon trophy, Team Smart Ag received prizes valued at $15K total, which included an interview with ITPro Today and opportunities to present their winning solution at highly-visible events at the conference. Hackathons as Part of IT Modernization Model The hackathon follows the White House¡¯s push toward IT modernization through the new Center of Excellence (CoE) model. The model has five focus areas: cloud adoption, IT infrastructure optimization, customer experience, service delivery analytics, and contact centers. USDA, which has been designated a CoE, is using this new model to support the improved use of IT resources throughout the department. The CoE is planning to support additional competitions this year.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jul 13,  The Stoltzfuses use high tunnels to lengthen the growing season for fresh fruits and vegetables. They built the first high tunnel on their own, and they liked it so much, they decided to build a second one with the help of NRCS.  For many farmers, the lessons of agriculture begin at a young age. This is true for Florence, Miss., farmer Kathy Stoltzfus, who says that her dad taught her what she knows when she was a child. She has fond memories of running barefoot through rice fields and the taste of freshly grown food. Now Stoltzfus and her husband, Bob, run a small farm in central Mississippi, where they raise fruits, vegetables and eggs. Her farming experience, coupled with his grocer experience, makes them a powerhouse at the Mississippi Farmers Market in Jackson, where they sell many different vegetables, including a variety of greens, broccoli, onions, radishes, peas, tomatoes, squash and zucchini. Their eggs are a hit, selling out every Saturday at the market. The Stoltzfuses started selling at the farmer¡¯s market as part-time farmers in , but two years later, the couple decided that they would leave their day jobs to farm full-time. While operating a small farm is hard work, they are happy with their successes and grateful for help from USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency that helps private landowners implement conservation to protect the environment and improve productivity. They learned about NRCS from a fellow producer at the market who told them about the technical assistance and cost-share assistance offered by the agency. Through NRCS¡¯ Environmental Quality Incentives Program, their farm is on pace to be certified as organic as early as the end of this year. NRCS also worked with the couple to build a seasonal high tunnel to keep their fruits and vegetables safe from the cold weather and construct a wildlife fence to protect their crops from hungry deer and rabbits. Bob and Kathy Stoltzfus (center) are working with NRCS conservationists Malcolm Lowe (left) and Mark Scott (right) to make their Florence, Miss. farm more productive. High tunnels have a metal frame wrapped in plastic and are easy and fairly cheap to build. They are designed to extend the growing season into the cold months, helping to increase productivity, keep plants at a steady temperature and even conserve water and energy. NRCS funds high tunnels as part of USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, launched in to help local food systems thrive. The Stoltzfuses plan to continue enlarging their operation. With 32 acres at their disposal, they hope to start a small beef cattle operation. Both say that they¡¯re doing what they¡¯re meant to do. Bob enjoys the quiet of the countryside, and Kathy is happy to have returned to her heritage. Learn more about the Environmental Quality Incentives Program Follow NRCS on Twitter.

USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. This challenge served as an important backdrop for USDA to hear feedback from the community on how the agency could prioritize its resources and shape future workplans related to organic agriculture and markets. Anchoring the panel of listeners were Mark Lipson, organic policy advisor to the Secretary and key coordinator of the department¡¯s organic agenda, and myself, as well as a host of rotating officials who represented agencies like the Foreign Agriculture Service, which engages in trade negotiations to expand agricultural product exchange with other countries, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which administers the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). A full spectrum of topics was covered during the day. Some shared their concerns about effects of genetic engineering on their businesses (genetic modification is an excluded method in the organic standards). Some emphasized the need to continue international negotiations that would facilitate trade and expand markets for their organic products. Some recognized the value of small farmers in organic sector innovation. Others highlighted the vital role of NOP enforcement in ensuring organic integrity. And still others highlighted the importance of engaging a new generation of farmers and expressed their support of programs that help alleviate the cost of certification. The wide range of topics and the people who shared them speak to the unique market value of USDA organic and the desire of organic stakeholders to protect the integrity of the seal.

"Risk Management Agency Administrator in  Rural  Jul 21,   USDA¡¯s Risk Management Agency (RMA) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) working together have made great strides in making acreage reporting simpler for farmers and ranchers. ?The Acreage and Crop Reporting Streamlining Initiative (ACRSI), seeks to reduce the reporting burden on producers submitting to USDA. In listening sessions with producers last year, FSA and the Office of the Chief Information Officer found some common themes emerged: 1) Producers want to provide their information such as acreage reporting , just once, and expect USDA agencies to share the internally -¡®one-stop¡¯ reporting; 2)? Producers currently provide the same information multiple times; and 3)? Acreage reporting is inefficient and is not always accurate ACRSI will standardize requirements and automate the reporting process.?

This is a federal requirement for homeowners moving from gypsy moth quarantine areas. By complying with the law, you may also save a forest. Gypsy moths are destructive, invasive pests! European gypsy moth larvae feed on over 300 plant species including oak, aspen and elm. Gypsy moths have defoliated more than ates since . About 70% of susceptible forests have never been infested and are at risk. Male gypsy moths are brown and smaller than female gypsy moths, which are primarily white. Females lay fuzzy yellowish-brown egg masses from which caterpillars emerge bearing distinctive red and blue dots. Like many invasive insects, gypsy moths can spread long distances with human assistance. They are notorious hitchhikers and lay their eggs on patio furniture, grills, lawn mowers, children¡¯s toys, and other outdoor items. Larvae can hide on untreated firewood or other wooden items such as pallets and crates. The good news is you can help stop them.

"Coordinator, USDA Caribbean Climate Hub in  Climate  Nov 09,  Four years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the Caribbean, there is still an urgency to understand how to best prepare farmers and working lands for future hurricanes. Agricultural advisors are first responders and witnesses of hurricane impacts and strategies used in hurricane preparedness and recovery. A new study by the USDA Caribbean Climate Hub analyzes the experiences of agricultural advisors involved in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to identify gaps in hurricane preparedness and recovery measures. ¡±Climate projections indicate the Caribbean will experience more intense hurricanes, which will increase the challenges to agriculture and food security. There is an urgent need to improve hurricane preparedness to minimize hurricane effects on the agricultural sector in the Caribbean,¡± said Dr. Nora ¨¢lvarez-Berr¨ªos, the study¡¯s lead author. The research team surveyed over 200 advisors from eight institutions who reported on the difficulties farmers face in the recovery process, including lack of supplies such as seeds, fertilizers and animal feed, lack of equipment and machinery for clean-up, impaired access to farms, and the need to expedite government assistance to meet farmers¡¯ needs. Importantly, advisors indicated that while farmers and ranchers do apply recovery practices, the application of short-term preparedness practices is limited, and long-term preparedness practices are generally uncommon. The advisors also reported on the challenges they face in assisting farmers, such as the inability to access farms, transportation issues, and lengthy times to reach farmers. They highlighted the need for more training and educational resources to improve hurricane recovery response, and more tools to help farmers cope with emotional distress post-disaster. The Caribbean Hub disseminates information on hurricane preparedness and best management practices to help reduce risks and mitigate hurricane effects.

"Pollinators like honeybees, butterflies, birds, bats and other animals are hard at work providing vital but often unnoticed services. They pollinate crops like apples, bananas, blueberries, strawberries, melon, peaches, potatoes, vanilla, almonds, coffee and chocolate. Pollinators by Numbers Three-fourths of the world¡¯s flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world¡¯s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. That¡¯s one out of every three bites of food you eat. More than 3,500 species of native bees help increase crop yields. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators like bees, butterflies and moths, birds and bats, and beetles and other insects. The Pollinator Partnership The Pollinator Partnership offers 32 different planting guides to improve pollinator habitat, each one tailored to a specific ecoregion in the United States. Each guide is filled with an abundance of native plant and pollinator information. Enter your zip code to find your planting guide. How Animal Pollination Works Pollinators visit flowers in their search for food (nectar and pollen). During a flower visit, a pollinator may accidentally brush against the flower¡¯s reproductive parts, unknowingly depositing pollen from flower to flower. The plant uses the pollen to produce a fruit or seed. Many plants cannot reproduce without pollen carried to them by foraging pollinators. Pollinators Are in Trouble You may have heard that bees are disappearing and bats are dying. These and other animal pollinators face many challenges in the modern world. Habitat loss, disease, parasites, and environmental contaminants have all contributed to the decline of many species of pollinators. Pollinators that can¡¯t find the right quantity or quality of food (nectar and pollen from blooming plants within flight range) don¡¯t survive. Right now, there simply aren¡¯t enough pollinator friendly plantings to support pollinators. Learn more about how USDA is helping pollinators. Learn more about these pollinators: Bats Butterflies Helpful Hint: Did you know dandelions are the first food for bees emerging in the spring. Leave them in your yard and feed the bees! Dandelion petals and leaves are also edible and can be used in salads. You Can Help Pollinators You can help pollinators in your garden at home. Pollinators make use of food and habitat anywhere it is found, whether on roadsides, in a schoolyard garden or a planter on a windowsill. Here¡¯s how:  Complete a Wildlife Assessment. One of the first steps in creating new habitat for pollinators is to first assess and evaluate your existing space. Habitat assessments can be great tools to identify practices where you can improve or confirm good practices you already have in place. The Xerces Society has several different habitat assessment guides for different types of landscapes or specific insects. The Habitat Assessment Guide for Pollinators in Yards, Gardens, and Parks is a great resource for small and urban sites, including urban farms. The Pollinators: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and Beneficial Insects: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and two other great options for assessing agricultural lands. For more information on providing ground, stem, and cavity nesting sites and overwintering sites, be sure to check out Xerces guide on Nesting & Overwintering Habitat for Pollinators & Other Beneficial Insects.  Types of Habitat. There are several habitat opportunities and strategies you can use to invite pollinators into your urban farms, gardens, or yards. Pollinator habitat can beautify your space, increase native biodiversity, increase pollination services and biological control of ¡°pest¡± insects, and provide community engagement and learning opportunities. Often for smaller scale gardens in urban areas, plugs or transplanted plants from pots are preferred over pure live wildflower seeds.  Plant Native Plants. Native plants are considered the best choice because of their abundance of nectar and pollen in addition to being low maintenance, generally pest free, drought tolerant, and ability to control erosion. They are good sources of food and shelter for wildlife, and naturally beautiful.  Plant a continuous food supply. Make sure you have at least 3 different species throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons to provide adequate food when pollinators emerge from and prepare for winter hibernation. Plant in groupings (clumps) of each plant species for a greater impact.  Include a diversity of plants. Different flower sizes, shapes and , as well as varying plant heights and growth habits, support a greater number and diversity of pollinators. Include a combination of native plant species, heirloom plants and herbs in your pollinator garden. Common herbs such as rosemary, oregano, basil, marjoram, and borage are excellent pollinator plants. Allow unharvested fruits and vegetables to bolt (go to flower) for added pollinator and beneficial insect food.  Limit or eliminate use of pesticides. A healthy garden with the appropriate plant species and an abundance of pollinators will support natural beneficial insects¡ªreducing the need for pest control.   Install bat boxes. Bats are also pollinators that need our help. Leave snags for habitat or install a bat box. Learn more about the benefits of bats!  Spread Awareness. Educate others about the importance of pollinators and share how you planted for bees, butterflies, birds and other animals at home.

"It's ideal to have host plants and nectar plants growing in your garden if your goal is to attract butterflies. Selecting what to plant varies enormously based on what butterfly species you wish to attract. Butterflies will roam in search of food and egg-laying sites for many miles¡ªeven hundreds to thousands¡ªof miles. Butterflies lay their eggs on host plants that the emerging caterpillars will eat. Different species of butterflies prefer different types of plants to lay their eggs on. Milkweed and Monarch Butterflies The monarch butterfly however is very specific and only lays her eggs on species of Asclepias - commonly known as milkweed. Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies migrate from the United States and Canada to overwintering areas in Mexico and California and make the return flight in spring. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat, are having a devastating impact on monarch populations. By planting milkweed you can help save the monarch butterfly.",What is one way individuals can contribute to conservation efforts for a specific species of butterfly?,"By planting milkweed, individuals can help save the Monarch butterfly population."
"The People's Garden Apiary, installed in , is located on the roof of the Jamie L. Whitten Building and has homed up to approximately 80,000 Italian honey bees. USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Bee Research Lab in Beltsville, Maryland, helps keep these colonies of bees strong and healthy so they can pollinate crops growing in the People's Garden and neighboring landscapes. They also produce delicious honey! Beehives are often important elements of urban gardens due to the pollination services they provide. They¡¯re also big business. Honeybees pollinate $ates each year, including more than 130 types of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Honeybees also produce honey, worth about $3.2 million in according to USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). How are hives constructed? The beehives are wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other. Each box (or super) holds 8-10 wooden frames which include a thin sheet of wax foundation in each frame. The bees build their combs on these foundations. How is honey extracted? Honey is stored in the combs in the upper parts of the hive. When the bees have filled the combs in the upper section with honey and covered them with wax caps, the beekeeper takes them away to extract the honey. Are honey bees native to the United States? Honey bees are not native to the United States. The scientific name for honey bee is Apis mellifera. Since humans first began keeping honey bees, their principal aim has been the harvest of honey. Beekeepers select the appropriate type of honey bee based on temperament, physical characteristics, disease resistance, and productivity. Italian honey bees were selected for the People's Garden Apiary because they are most often used in commercial beekeeping in the United States. These bees have a relatively gentle disposition and are good honey producers. They are not the most resistant to disease, but they excel in most other areas. There have been some queen survivorship issues in both of the People's Garden colonies, which actually mirrors what's going on in the rest of the country. Queen health is an issue for everyone who buys queens, commercial or hobbyist. The exact underlying reasons for poor queen survivorship is unknown, but the ARS lab is actively researching this problem.",What are some common issues affecting queen honey bee survival in commercial and hobbyist beekeeping operations?,"Some common issues affecting queen honey bee survival include queen health problems, disease resistance, poor temperament, physical characteristics, and productivity.

"Bats occupy almost every habitat in the world. There are over 1,300 species of bats worldwide. Bats are one of the most misunderstood animals. People imagine them to be blood-sucking, rabies-ridden, hair-tangling, night-stalking, loathsome creatures. The truth is, very few bats (less than 1 percent) carry rabies. Even fewer bats are bold enough to come near people, and most feed on pollen or insects. Many are listed as endangered. Bats reportedly eat as many as 600 insects in an hour. By leaving snags and habitat or putting up a bat house, you provide a safe place for bats to live and you may notice fewer mosquitoes and insects around your home or in your garden. Bats devour tons of insects nightly, pollinate flowers, and spread seeds that grow new plants and trees. They are our most important natural predators of night-flying insects, consuming mosquitoes, moths, beetles, crickets, leafhoppers and chinch bugs, among others. Many of these insects are serious crop or forest pests, while others spread disease to humans or livestock. Every year, bats save us billions of dollars in pest control by simply eating insects. Bat houses are easy to build. The narrow slats in the bat house give bats a safe dark place to crawl in and sleep during the day. It often takes 2 years for bats to occupy a new bat house because bats don¡¯t relocate often. Bats are loyal to a roost site, so unless it¡¯s destroyed or overcrowded bats won¡¯t move to another location. Even if only about 15 percent of bat houses are occupied at any time, by building one and putting it up in the right place, you're doing your part to help and encourage bats in rural, suburban, and urban areas.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Jan 30,  Jordyn Ash, a sophomore at Florida Agricultural & Mechanical University (FAMU) in Tallahassee, is a USDA National Scholar studying plant and soil sciences. Ash applied to the USDA National Scholars Program during her senior year of high school. She recalls guidance counselors providing excellent summaries of different scholarship opportunities, but she decided that the USDA National Scholars Program offered the best fit for her career aspirations. USDA scholars are awarded annual tuition, fees, books and room and board for each academic year of their scholarship. They also have an opportunity to work with USDA each summer and, upon completion of their academic degree program, to continue their professional career with USDA. She spent last summer in Orangeburg, South Carolina completing an internship as a soil conservationist with USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. Ash, originally from Covington, Georgia just outside Atlanta, appreciated the rural setting of Orangeburg. ¡°It was really fun to experience a different climate and observe different agricultural methods,¡± she said.

"Vermont/New Hampshire USDA Rural Development state director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 12,  USDA Rural Development¡¯s Business and Loan Guarantee Program supported new construction for an expanded Brattleboro Food Coop in Brattleboro, Vermont. The original plan for two stories was expanded to four thanks to an innovative partnership with the Windsor Housing Trust to develop mixed-income apartments. ¡°Smart Growth¡± is a term we hear more and more often.? It is the idea that as communities plan for the future, they consider the highest and best use of every resource ¨C land, infrastructure, organizations and people.? ? From housing to transportation to energy to food; community developers and planners are asking how Smart Growth principles can be applied to ensure a sustainable and dynamic future for their communities and their residents. How is USDA involved in these efforts? Consider Brattleboro, Vermont.? With a population of 12,000, Brattleboro sits on the state¡¯s southeastern border, and is a vibrant mix of industry, art and education.? ??Brattleboro¡¯s downtown district was one of the first communities to take advantage of Vermont¡¯s Downtown Program giving it access to state tax credits and shining a spotlight on its rich history. Its vibrant downtown is an inviting mix of shops, restaurants, offices and an art deco theatre and hotel.? ??Anchoring one end of the downtown is the Brattleboro Food Coop. Founded in , the Brattleboro Food Coop started as a local buying club.? It eventually grew into a popular retail destination featuring a wide range of products from nearby farms in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. ?By , the Brattleboro Coop was outgrowing its space.? It considered moving to a new location outside of downtown.? The Board of the Coop, however, decided that its mission was much more compatible with a Smart Growth solution to its expansion needs.? ? In the meantime, the Windham and Windsor Housing Trust (WWHT) and Housing Vermont, were looking for a solution to?Brattleboro¡¯s need for more mixed income housing that was easily accessible to downtown¡¯s services and amenities. With support from a loan guarantee from USDA¡¯s Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program, the Brattleboro Coop remained downtown in a new, highly energy efficient building with expanded retail space. ?The new Coop space was originally envisioned as a two story building.?? Through innovative partnerships, an additional two stories on the new building were sold to WWHT and Housing Vermont.? ?Though the Coop and the housing complex have separate ownership, they have similar commitment to the sustainable future of Brattleboro. The Brattleboro Coop is featured in the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass for its dedication to local food and local communities. It recently received a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its commitment to Smart Growth principles.  The results are stunning.? The new Brattleboro Coop Building opened in June, . It now boasts over 14,000 square feet of retail space, supporting up to 100 jobs.? Over 60 percent of the products come from nearby farms.? The building also hosts a commissary kitchen and classrooms for cooking classes.?? 24 beautiful, energy efficient, mixed income apartments in the heart of downtown Brattleboro occupy two stories above the Coop. Recently, the Brattleboro Coop won a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These awards, which began in , recognize exceptional approaches to development that respect the environment, foster economic vitality, enhance quality of life, and provide new opportunities for disadvantaged communities. ¡°The new Cooperative Building incorporates money-saving and innovative environmental features while fitting with the character of a traditional walkable New England town¡± noted the EPA. ¡°Community members were the true champions of this project, insisting on a downtown location for their co-op that integrates both the grocery store and mixed-income housing¡±.

"Chief, FSA Public Affairs in  Conservation  Aug 22,  New Jersey farmer Liang Shao Hua listens to NRCS technical advisor Frank Wu provide advice in Chinese Mandarin, Liang¡¯s native language. His limited English proficiency restricted his exposure to USDA farm programs until Tropical Storm Sandy made it necessary for Liang to connect with the department for assistance. He is now an FSA loan recipient and appreciates the cost-share benefits of the Emergency Conservation Program funds that assisted his family¡¯s clean-up efforts. Disasters create pain.? And recovery from disasters creates partnerships and opportunity. That is the lesson Liang Shao Hua learned in the past year after Tropical Storm Sandy, also known as Super Storm Sandy, destroyed his New Jersey high-tunnel farming operation and left him wondering how to manage his loss. Liang, a Chinese American with very limited English proficiency, relied first on his American-born son, Peter, a 21-year-old college student studying at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New York. Peter obtained USDA paperwork from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) that helped his father apply for Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funds.? He, his brother, David, 19, and mother, Pei Yin, joined Liang in the clean-up efforts. Liang Shao Hua was among 315 successful applicants for ECP, one-third from New Jersey.? The applicants stretched from West Virginia to New Hampshire. That was the wide swath where Sandy and her trailing cold front left a path of destruction to Atlantic Coast and New England farms. Congress authorizes ECP funds to assist farmers and ranchers with removal of debris.? Funds can be used to do tasks like repair fences.? The objective is to return the land that has been damaged by a natural disaster to normal productive use. Liang began farming his New Jersey acreage in .? After immigrating to the United States in , Liang had tried his hand in the restaurant, clothing and local trucking industries. ?He said a friend told him to look into farming, so he did.? He bought land and began to grow vegetables. His 54-acre farm in Mercer County, 60 miles southwest of New York City, did well in the summer.? He grew traditional Asia vegetables ¨C bitter melon, Chinese long beans, greens and various choy sum, also known as Chinese flowering cabbage. Liang said through an interpreter that he enjoys farming because ¡°I¡¯m my own boss.¡± He chose to expand his growing season in . He erected 20 high tunnels to heat, water and protect his seedlings so he could produce well into cooler outdoor temperatures.? The high tunnels went up two months before Sandy hit. Once the storm struck, Liang needed help. ?FSA came to his aid. ?So did others with more than financial assistance. ?Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) New Jersey Partner Employee Frank Wu appeared with multiple skills. One of which was the ability to speak Mandarin Chinese.? He also provided technical counsel. Among the FSA staff called on to take a lead role was Matthew Pavone, a Farm Loan Specialist.? Pavone began processing an emergency loan, a low-interest rate credit tool made available when the Secretary of Agriculture declares a county a natural disaster area.? Coincidentally, Pavone is married to an Asian American, although he says she was adopted by an Italian American family, so ¡°she¡¯s more Italian than I am.¡±? Still, her birth heritage drew both of them to study and appreciate the Asian culture.? Pavone and Liang related well. The other FSA knights in shining armor were Monmouth County Executive Director Gabor (Gabi) Grunstein and Program Technician Beth Pine.? Grunstein and Pine set up the cost-share ECP to help the Liang family clean up Sandy¡¯s mess. The storm ripped apart the new high tunnels, folded aluminum piping, snapped wood braces and irrigation water lines, and threw nearby trees into the structures.? Clean-up was laborious, but it got done. With FSA¡¯s loan funds in hand, Liang quickly rebuilt his high-tunnel operation for this season¡¯s production.? His voice radiates excitement when speaking.? He is clearly much happier in than he was a year earlier.? He knows who to thank: Pavone, Grunstein, Pine and Wu, among others as USDA. New Jersey FSA State Executive Director Paul Hlubik said the experience was a significant breakthrough for the department as well.? Liang was a typical small-farm producer handicapped by his language barrier.? That put Liang in a category that the department recognizes as an important contributor to the overall farm economy, but one needing special assistance. ?Liang¡¯s limited ability to know about the services available from his adoptive national government calls for extraordinary outreach to assist him and farmers like Liang. Hlubik asserts that Liang¡¯s son, Peter, was clearly one who helped his father become aware of opportunities because of the young man¡¯s schooling.? Now that his father understands one of USDA¡¯s roles in assisting agricultural producers, he may become a valued customer for life. Liang says he¡¯s eager to expand his operation, buy more land and grow more vegetables.? He said the Asian market is growing.? Hlubik and Pavone say the grocery stores and chains like H-Mart appreciate operations like Liang¡¯s.? The New Jersey farmland is perfectly located to easily serve markets and restaurants from New York City to Philadelphia. No natural disaster is welcomed, but it did open up new opportunities for Liang Shao Hua.? He discovered new partners and new ways of doing business through USDA.? Meanwhile, USDA discovered a new customer who produces a highly valued crop. Does he fear future storms?? Liang says, ¡°weather doesn¡¯t matter; it¡¯s going to happen.? What matters is to keep moving forward.¡±  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Tags:  disaster  Emergency Conservation Program  Farmers  FSA  high tunnels  Hurricane Sandy  New Hampshire  New Jersey  New York City  NRCS  Philadelphia  Producer  Ranchers  vegetables  West Virginia",What are some ways that the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) can assist small-farm producers with limited English proficiency in recovering from natural disasters?,"The USDA's FSA can assist small-farm producers with limited English proficiency in recovering from natural disasters through various means, including: * Providing emergency loans with low-interest rates to help farmers cover costs associated with disaster relief and recovery * Offering cost-share benefits under the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) funds to help farmers clean up debris and repair damaged infrastructure * Partnering with organizations such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to provide technical assistance and support to farmers in need * Utilizing staff members who speak multiple languages, such as Mandarin Chinese, to facilitate communication and outreach to limited-English-proficient farmers * Collaborating with local county executive directors and program technicians to set up cost-share ECP programs and assist farmers in accessing available funds."

"Alaskan Forest Floors Sprout Array of Interesting Mushrooms  The fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) sits on the forest floor in Alaska as if it is waiting to be cast in an Alice in Wonderland movie. Its recognizable bright red cap dotted with white warts belies their toxic nature. Although the effects vary, experts warn against eating them. In Alaska, fly agaric is generally found around birch or spruce trees and loves the northwest environment.  Kathryn Sosbe, Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Apr 30,   1 Response",What types of forest management practices are recommended to minimize the presence of fly agaric mushrooms in Alaska's forests?,"According to the content, there is no specific information about recommended forest management practices to minimize the presence of fly agaric mushrooms.

"Veterans Restore Historic Site on North Carolina's Uwharrie National Forest  Under a new program to help veterans re-enter civilian life and find career-oriented employment, eight military veterans visited the Uwharrie National Forest near Asheboro, N.C. as part of their summer program to gain experience in developing historic preservation skills, they restored a historic site of farm buildings on the forest. ¡°I recognized the importance of preserving these buildings for generations to come and am grateful to be just a small part of the process,¡± said Tyler Price, a veteran and history and anthropology student at California University at Fresno.  Stevin Westcott, National Forests in North Carolina, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Jul 22,   Respond to this story",What conservation efforts can be implemented on historic farmland sites to preserve agricultural heritage?,"Implementing the following conservation efforts on historic farmland sites can help preserve agricultural heritage: 1. **Restoration of original farm structures**: Restore or rebuild farm buildings, such as barns and silos, using traditional materials and techniques to maintain their historical integrity. 2. **Soil conservation**: Protect and restore soil health by implementing sustainable farming practices, like crop rotation, cover cropping, and reduced tillage. 3. **Crop preservation**: Identify and preserve heirloom crops or varieties that are significant to the site's agricultural history, through seed banks or controlled environments. 4. **Wildlife habitat creation**: Establish wildlife habitats that promote biodiversity and ecosystem services, such as pollinators, beneficial insects, or fish, which were likely present in the historic farm setting. 5. **Education and outreach**: Develop educational programs, tours, or workshops to share the site's agricultural history with visitors, promoting an understanding of the importance of preserving heritage farming practices. These efforts can be implemented by collaborating with local farmers, historians, conservation organizations, and government agencies to ensure the long-term preservation of historic farmland sites."
"Restoration Efforts May Mean More 'Chestnuts Roasting....'  ¡°Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,¡± is a line from a song that conjures up fond holiday memories for some Americans. For others, the joy of roasting chestnuts has yet to be experienced. But the lack of American chestnuts could change in the coming years, thanks to some very dedicated people. The U.S. Forest Service and its partners may be one step closer to restoring the American chestnut tree to parts of the mountains and forests of the southern United States. Since , they planted close to 1,000 potentially-blight resistant American chestnut trees on national forests in North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia.  Ryan Johnson, North Carolina, U.S. Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Dec 06,   7 Responses",What is the potential impact of restoring the American chestnut tree on forest ecosystems in the southern United States?,"The restoration of the American chestnut tree may lead to a resurgence of ""Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,"" with potentially millions of trees growing across the southern United States, although exact numbers are not provided."
"Posted by Written by Katie Yocum, USDA Rural Development in  Initiatives  USDA Results  Technology  Jun 11,  While the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is rich in cultural pride, identity and history, its remote location in the rugged terrain of Southeast Oklahoma has severely limited the tribe¡¯s economic development efforts.? But a Broadband Initiative Program grant, made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will enable Pine Telephone Company (PTC) to use innovative wireless technology to deliver affordable broadband service to portions of this rural, remote and economically disadvantaged region in Southeast Oklahoma. During World War II, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma provided an invaluable service to the United States by pioneering the use of Code Talking, using the native Choctaw language, to prevent enemy forces from intercepting the transmission of army secrets. And in , the Choctaw Nation was awarded the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition of support of employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.? So while the Choctaw Nation has shown outstanding compassion for the nation and its tribal members, the local economies of Choctaw communities have suffered tremendously.? Of the five counties on tribal lands that will be served by PTC, all of them are plagued with unemployment rates that soar above the state average and a substantial proportion of residents living below the poverty line. PTC spent years testing broadband technologies that would offer reliable internet service to residents of this remote region, and they determined that advanced 3G technology presents the most viable solution. The system is designed to be scalable and to cost-effectively accommodate technology upgrades, so that it will remain viable for years to come. PTC¡¯s system will offer service to nearly 5,000 households, 10 school districts, and 12 volunteer fire departments and ambulance services. With reliable, high speed wireless access, the region will be able to overcome their geographic isolation to stimulate the sustainable economic growth that it needs.? And offering quality internet access to key community institutions, like schools and public safety bodies, will mean better educational opportunities and enhanced health care and public safety for residents of this region. And in addition to the many benefits to be reaped by members of the Choctaw Nation, this Recovery Act project will also create more than 150 jobs over the multi-year construction period. With assistance from Oklahoma USDA Public Information Coordinator Kathleen James. A Pine Telephone Company broadband site in Oklahoma. USDA funds will deliver affordable broadband to portions of the Choctaw Nation.

"Southwest Regional Assistant WIC Director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 21,  Claudia Crow, a farmer from Shawnee, OK, assists a customer during the Pottowatomie County Famers Market Five-Year Anniversary.  In the hustle and bustle of working for the WIC program in the Southwest Region, I travel quite often, attending meetings and ensuring logistics much like many of my fellow federal and state co-workers. Recently I had the privilege to attend the Pottawatomie County Farmers Market five-year anniversary in Shawnee, OK. Having grown up in a very rural town, representing FNS was a learning experience that reminded me of home. The event was a total success, as the market was full of people including farmers, seniors, families and children. Celebrating five years of service, the event included live music, family and children¡¯s activities, and most important of all: fresh fruit and vegetables. I learned that famers drive hours to sell their crops at the market, and it accounts for as much as over two-thirds of their income. Most farmers market customers swear by the produce bought there, as it is much fresher and lasts longer than normal store-bought produce. In some cases, supermarket produce makes a week-long journey of over 1,500 miles before getting into the kitchen. But the most important part was seeing FNS programs like WIC and SNAP EBT represented. All of the farmers were knowledgeable about Farm to School and Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, and have even started farm tours for children and have working relationships with local schools. Getting fresh vegetables in school cafeterias straight from the farm is great on so many levels! Observing our partnerships at the grassroots stage from farmer to a customer, or farmer to a school sets a tone for the whole region. The relationships I see built are ones that last for years, and I wish the Farmers Market all the best in their future endeavors. Here¡¯s to another five years of successful farming and selling!

"In USDA, there are five types of Departmental Directives: Departmental Regulations, Departmental Manuals, Departmental Guidebooks, Departmental Notices, and Secretary¡¯s Memoranda. DR -001, Departmental Directives System prescribes the policies, responsibilities, standards, and procedures for issuing Departmental Directives. Departmental Regulations (DR). Departmental Regulations (DR) promulgate Departmental policy; delegate authority; establish responsibility; establish statutory or interagency committees; and prescribe high-level procedures governing USDA activities and operations. DRs also may include selected material of an administrative nature that is published in the Federal Register or the Code of Federal Regulations. DRs must be reviewed and revised or reissued at least every 5 years to ensure they remain aligned with current applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements. Departmental Manuals (DM). Departmental Manuals (DM) are used for detailed, relatively lengthy but higher-level technical guidance that is procedural in nature and Departmentwide in scope. Manuals generally are written for ""specialist"" audiences. They provide standards and guidance pertaining to a particular subject or administrative function, generally of the type that must be referred to on a daily or frequent basis. Some manuals implement external agency directives with USDA policy and procedural guidance. DMs must be reviewed and revised or reissued at least every 3 years to ensure they remain aligned with current statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements. Departmental Guidebooks (DG). Departmental Guidebooks (DG) provide guidance and very detailed information which may be more technical or programmatic in nature, which assists in implementing policies found in DRs and processes and procedures found in DMs. DGs may include guides, handbooks, standards, reference books, standard operating procedures, and other similar documents. DGs may not establish policy or impose roles and responsibilities beyond those found in the governing Departmental directive. Unlike DRs and DMs which should remain technology agnostic, DGs may be used to provide highly detailed technology or system specific procedures, instructions, or standards. DGs will be subject to a streamlined formal clearance process (see DM -001) and will provide OPIs with a method to quickly issue enforceable guidance in an agile environment under the Departmental Directives System. DGs must be reviewed and revised or reissued at least every 3 years to ensure they remain aligned with current statutory, regulatory, and/or policy, technical, and standards requirements. Departmental Notices (DN). Departmental Notices (DN) announce: (a) policy or procedure of Departmentwide interest that is temporary or of a onetime nature that addresses a single subject; (b) permanent policy or procedure which requires immediate dissemination and will be codified into a DR or DM within 1 year; or (c) delegations of Authority from the Assistant or Under Secretaries or other General Officers pending publication in the Federal Register. DNs may not be in effect for more than 1 year and cannot be renewed or reissued. Secretary's Memoranda (SM). Secretary¡¯s Memoranda (SM) establish or announce changes in major policy concerning missions and programs of the Department, direct or implement action on Departmental programs, or redirect or change policy or action in Departmental programs. Examples include actions which by law require the endorsement of the Secretary of Agriculture and delegations of authority by the Secretary. SMs may not be in effect for more than 1 year and cannot be renewed or reissued.","What is the minimum frequency at which Departmental Regulations (DR) must be reviewed and revised or reissued to ensure they remain aligned with current applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy requirements in USDA?",At least every 5 years.
"The USDA Departmental Directives system is the online repository of all USDA Departmental Regulations, Notices, Manuals, Guidebooks, and Secretary¡¯s Memoranda. The Departmental Directives system is managed by the Office of Budget and Program Analysis (OBPA), Departmental Policy Office (DPO). OBPA DPO facilitates the final editing, review, clearance, and publication process for all Departmental directives. USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices will use the Departmental Directives system to issue policies, procedures, and guidance which have general applicability to employees and two or more agencies or staff offices. Directives that are applicable to only one agency or staff office are not part of the Departmental directives system; those guidance documents are managed by the respective agency or staff office. The Directives system can be accessed by selecting ¡°Directives by Category¡± from the navigation panel on the left of this screen. From that web page, users can find resources for creating and clearing Departmental directives, plain language support, and the listing of all active Departmental Directives.","What is the primary process by which USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices issue policies and procedures related to agricultural practices?","The primary process by which USDA Mission Areas, agencies, and staff offices issue policies and procedures related to agricultural practices is through the Departmental Directives system."

However, based on general knowledge, if we were to classify agricultural activities as inherently governmental or commercial in nature, it could imply: * Inherently Governmental: The government would be responsible for providing support and services directly to farmers, which might lead to a more direct involvement of the state in farm management practices. * Commercial: If agricultural activities are classified as commercial, the focus would shift towards private enterprise and market-driven decisions. This could result in farmers being more accountable to their investors or customers rather than government regulations. Please note that this is not directly related to the provided content but a general hypothetical interpretation based on the concepts of inherently governmental and commercial activities."
"U.S. Forest Service, Office of Communication in  Forestry  Aug 08,  Researchers prepare for the next phase in examining physical fire processes by adding the effect of a slope. Photo credit: Mark Finney In recent months, we have all become familiar with images in the media of wildland firefighters digging lines, air tankers dropping retardant and fire engines dispersing water. You may wonder ¡°how do these firefighters know what it takes to fight fire?¡± The short answer is: research. Before a wildland firefighter sees his or her first fire, they are given the tools and training on how to fight fire and its behavior. The information passed onto them is not learned overnight but rather through years of research. In the US Forest Service¡¯s Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory, in Montana, employees conduct research on flame, smoke, fuel types and how fire spreads. The lab has six different focus areas including one called the Physical Fire Processes which studies the fundamental physics of fire spread. Another one, Fuel Dynamics, works to make the process of fire behavior and its effects more accurately predictable, and the Smoke Emissions and Dispersion area¡¯s focus is on a better understanding of smoke movement from fires and potential impacts. Other focus areas concentrate on the effects of fire on plants and the study of how a forest responds to fire disturbances and climate change. Fire and firefighting have been around for centuries, so what else can we learn? The answer is a lot. In fact, we learn more each day. For example, in the lab received an award for its research in buoyant flame dynamics in wildfire spread. As everyone knows, fire is hot, but the question that remained unanswered was ¡°how is heat from a fire transferred to other fuels like pine needles so that it spreads?¡± Our lab researchers discovered convection, or hot gasses bursting rapidly forward from the flames, which occurs by contact of air or fluid moving past an object, transferred fire.? Before this discovery, most scientists had considered radiation, the heat we feel from the sun or a fire, to be the key heat transfer mechanism in wildfires. The research showed that flame and hot gasses are forced into contact with new fuels because the rising motion of hot flames actually causes downward flow of cooler replacement air nearby. Thus flames form an alternating pattern of up and down motions along a fire front, and these motions cause the air to spin in the direction wind is moving. After reading about the research our agency has been doing, you might have some ideas yourself, such as having the Forest Service test a new retardant (something that can be very time consuming and expensive).

Many of you already have your trees up, I'm sure, but for just as many, if not more, your tree will be making it's way home sometime over the next week. The National Christmas Tree Association estimates that 25-30 million trees are sold in the U.S. each year. All but a tiny percentage of those are grown for harvest on Christmas tree farms in 49 of our 50 states. (The Census of Agriculture indicates no tree farms in Wyoming now, though it had 8 in . I can't say that none exist, only that none are reported. But doesn't that seem odd -- no Christmas tree farms in Wyoming, but 37 in Hawaii? Who would have thought?) As for buying a tree, I know you don't need me to tell you about all the commercial options at your disposal. You probably passed a handful on your latest trip to the grocery store. But if you like the idea of selecting and cutting your own tree, check out this directory of u-cut farms. In addition, many National Forests, particularly in New England and the West, allow you to select and cut your own tree with a pre-purchased permit. (Rules are set and permits sold by regional forests, so do your research before heading out.) Once you get the tree home, follow the resources for keeping it green that my plant-loving colleagues have pulled together. Water, you might guess, is the key. So, what's your favorite type of tree to use at Christmas? Blue spruce? Douglas fir? Scotch pine? Something else? And, dare I ask, are you pro- or anti-tinsel?

Kelly Clark, USDA Nevada Public Information Officer  Posted in  Rural  Aug 22,   Respond to this story",How can advanced biofuels production from municipal solid waste help mitigate the impact of drought on ranchers and farmers?,"Advanced biofuels production from municipal solid waste can help reduce the demand for water-intensive crops, such as corn and soybeans, that are often used to produce traditional biofuels. By using waste materials instead, land can be preserved for food crop production, thereby mitigating the impact of drought on ranchers and farmers who rely on these crops for their livelihoods."
"Plant to Cut Landfill Deposits, Create Nearly 500 Jobs  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .12  Contact:Jay Fletcher, 690-  WASHINGTON, August 6, - Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced a $105 million loan guarantee to Fulcrum Sierra BioFuels, LLC to finance development of a ground-breaking facility to convert municipal solid waste into advanced biofuels. The project will help reduce the nation's dependence on foreign oil, relieve pressure on existing and future landfills, and stimulate economic growth in Northern Nevada through job creation.""The time is now to embrace alternative American-produced feedstocks that support our nation's energy independence, provide jobs in rural areas, and support the Obama Administration's 'all of the above' energy strategy,"" Vilsack said. ""At USDA we are focused on the production of renewable energy from a wide variety of non-food sources, including waste, algae, wood, and switchgrass as a long-term solution to America's energy needs. The facility we are announcing today will help create nearly 500 jobs in Nevada and is a perfect example of how producing home-grown energy is good for the economy and good for our energy future.""The Nevada plant is expected to create an estimated orey County, 20 miles east of Reno. Once operational, the plant is expected to convert 147,000 tons of processed municipal solid waste into over 10 million gallons of advanced biofuels annually using a two-part thermo-chemical process.Based in Pleasanton, California, the operator, Fulcrum Sierra BioFuels is a privately held company that focuses on developing facilities that convert municipal solid waste and other waste products to a low-cost, reliable and environmentally clean renewable transportation fuel.USDA, through its Rural Development Biorefinery Assistance Program (Section of the Farm Bill), approved an 80 percent loan guarantee to finance the project, with a conditional commitment that Fulcrum Sierra BioFuels, LLC must meet before loan closing.Today's announcement is part of a larger USDA effort to produce advanced biofuels in every region of the country. USDA has funded 7 additional biorefineries that are using feedstocks like agriculture residue, woody biomass, municipal solid waste, and algae in states from Florida and Michigan to New Mexico. USDA is also investing in research by coordinating with five regional research centers to work on the science necessary to ensure profitable biofuels can be produced from a diverse range of feedstocks. To encourage the production of advanced biofuels from non-food, non-feed sources, USDA has incentivized farmers to grow advanced feedstocks on nearly 60,000 acres, helping companies across the country spur production of new biofuels from non-food, non-feed sources.The Biorefinery Assistance Program, administered by Rural Development's Business and Cooperative Service, is designed to financially assist with the commercial deployment of production technologies to produce advanced biofuels, and thereby increase the energy independence of the United States; promote resource conservation, public health, and the environment; diversify markets for agricultural and forestry products and agriculture waste material; create jobs and enhance the economic development of the rural economy.The Obama administration, with Agriculture Secretary Vilsack's leadership, has worked tirelessly to strengthen rural America, maintain a strong farm safety net, and create opportunities for America's farmers and ranchers. U.S. agriculture is currently experiencing one of its most productive periods in American history thanks to the productivity, resiliency, and resourcefulness of our producers.Creating new markets for the nation's agricultural products through biobased manufacturing is one of the many steps the Administration has taken over the past three years to strengthen the rural economy. Since August , the White House Rural Council has supported a broad spectrum of rural initiatives including a Presidential Memorandum to create jobs in rural America through biobased and sustainable product procurement, a $350 million commitment in SBA funding to rural small businesses over the next 5 years, launching a series of conferences to connect investors with rural start-ups, creating capital marketing teams to pitch federal funding opportunities to private investors interested in making rural and making job search information available at 2,800 local USDA offices nationwide.Since taking office, President Obama's Administration has taken historic steps to improve the lives of rural Americans, put people back to work and build thriving economies in rural communities. From proposing the American Jobs Act to establishing the first-ever White House Rural Council - chaired by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack - the President is committed to a smarter use of existing Federal resources to foster sustainable economic prosperity and ensure the government is a strong partner for businesses, entrepreneurs and working families in rural communities. is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Nov 24,  Large White turkey female. USDA-ARS photo by Scott Bauer. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio.?? Let¡¯s talk turkey. You¡¯re going to hear a lot about food safety as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, but what you often don¡¯t hear about is how U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) scientists are working to make turkey, chicken and other poultry products safer to eat long before they reach your table.? USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are developing alternatives to antibiotics that can help prevent turkey diseases and reduce bacteria such as Salmonella and Campylobacter¡ªtwo of the main pathogens in poultry that cause foodborne illness in people. While we depend on antibiotics to treat bacterial infections in people, it also is necessary to treat these infections in food animals.? Through U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, USDA works with veterinarians and producers to be more judicious in their antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe. This is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics.? Other USDA work in this area was covered last week during World Antibiotics Awareness Week.? For example, at the USDA-ARS Poultry Production and Products Safety Research Unit in Fayetteville, Arkansas, scientists are studying the effects of adding natural supplements such as yeast and vitamin D to turkey feed to help keep them healthy and control poultry diseases.? In one study, retired ARS microbiologist Geraldine Huff, physiologist Narayan Rath and their colleagues found that adding yeast extract to feed eaten by turkeys could help protect them against Clostridial dermatitis, a disease that causes lesions and sudden death in male turkeys. They concluded that feeding yeast extract¡ªan inexpensive and widely available feed additive¡ªto turkeys can help in managing the disease and keep turkeys heathy.? Finding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply. ??Last week was World Antibiotics Awareness Week.?? Using natural supplements is just one method ARS researchers are exploring to help improve the safety of turkey products that can be enjoyed Thanksgiving and the year round.

"Ph.D., USDA-GIPSA¡¯s Chief Scientist in  Food and Nutrition  Research and Science  Feb 12,  Broken kernels are indicated above. With a little help from USDA, consumer-grade photo scanners could revolutionize rice grading. Consumers much prefer whole kernels of milled rice over broken pieces.? Whole kernels offer more consistent cooking qualities and are in many cases considered more visually appealing.? As a result, the price paid to a rice producer for a load of rough rice can be impacted by the percentage of broken kernels within a sample of rice after it has been milled. USDA¡¯s Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration is developing software for use with consumer-grade photo scanners to measure the percent of broken kernels in milled rice quickly and accurately.? ?When rough rice is graded in accordance with USDA¡¯s Rice Grading Standards, the percentage of broken kernels within a sample is determined by a trained grader¡¯s visual inspection. Mechanical sizing equipment instead of visual inspection is routinely used for separating whole and broken rice pieces at various points of the rice marketing process to save time and cost, but mechanical sizing doesn¡¯t account for inherent differences in rice kernel size. USDA¡¯s Rice Studio software rapidly analyzes images of milled rice from a flat-bed scanner.? It identifies fully intact kernels, and then precisely compares fractured kernels with the most similar fully intact kernels to determine whether each fractured kernel is whole or broken.? The program then computes the percentage of broken kernels by weight.? ?The entire process requires less than five minutes.

An alarmingly high number of households that lack a car in Wayne County are located further than one mile from the closest grocery store, meaning that many families struggle to get access to fresh and healthy food. ?Indeed, the closure of two supermarkets in left Detroit as the largest city in the country without a single full-service supermarket within its boundaries. A recent study indicates that over half a million of Detroit¡¯s residents live in neighborhoods where they must travel twice as far to reach a grocery store than they do to reach a convenience store. As a result, many families are forced to buy their meals at these convenience stores, where microwavable pre-prepared meals and fast food are well-stocked, and fresh and healthy foods are often hard to find.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Oct 01,  Rangeland fires can sweep out of uncontrol across thousands of acres in the Great Basin. Photo credit: ARS Northwest Watershed Research Center, Boise, Idaho Cattle grazing on a nearly half mile wide targeted strip of cheatgrass near Beowawe, Nevada, created a firebreak that helped limit a rangeland fire to just 54 acres this past August compared to rangeland fires that more commonly race across thousands of acres of the Great Basin. The same grazed fuel break held the Boulder Creek Fire in July to just 1,029 acres. This ¡°targeted grazing¡± firebreak and eight others are part of an evaluation project being managed by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), partnering with other federal, state and local agencies and local cattle ranchers in Idaho, Nevada and Oregon. These demonstration sites are being studied so the concept¡¯s efficacy and environmental impacts can be uniformly evaluated and compared. ¡°The basic idea is to use cattle grazing in the early spring to mow extensive strips of highly-flammable cheatgrass down to 2- to 3-inch stubble in strategic places to remove the fuel that can turn small rangeland fires into megafires in a matter of hours. These fuel breaks are intended to slow fire spread, make it less intense, and provides places from which firefighters can more safely attack and contain the fire,¡± explained ARS Rangeland Scientist Pat Clark with the Northwest Watershed Research Center in Boise, Idaho, who directs the project. Clark is tracking how much fuel is reduced by targeted grazing, whether these fuel reductions can be maintained up to the start of the wildfire season, typically July 1 in the Great Basin, and what effects targeted grazing might have on environmental health such as changes in plant composition. Cheatgrass is an invasive annual that dominates more than 100 million acres of the Great Basin in the western U.S. Germinating each winter, cheatgrass grows furiously in spring and dies in early summer, leaving the range carpeted in golden dry tinder. The Great Basin now has the nation¡¯s highest wildfire risk, and rangeland fires are outpacing forest fires when it comes to acreage destroyed. ¡°The most challenging part of the project is getting the targeted grazing treatment applied within the narrow and dynamic window when cheatgrass is palatable and sought out by grazing cattle,¡± Clark said. The duration and timing of that palatability window changes every year, depending on temperatures and soil moisture. The logistics of getting cattle to the right place at the right time and keeping them there is challenging,¡± Clark added. Part of the evaluation project is to look at the impact of targeted cattle grazing on environmental health as well as the effectiveness of the firebreak.

"Research and Development, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 30,  Cattle grazing at sunset in fall on public lands in Malheur County, Oregon, the Steens Mountains are in the distance. (Photo Credit: Greg Shine, Bureau of Land Management) Drought can be a serious game changer for rangeland, wildlife and wildland fire managers. America¡¯s 662 million acres of public rangelands support wildlife like sage grouse, game species like deer and elk, and support rural communities by providing forage for livestock and places to enjoy the great outdoors. This is why ranchers and range management specialists have a long history of working together to assess healthy range conditions. Until recently though, the lack of cost-effective and impartial monitoring of range conditions has been a challenge. In , the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station (RMRS) rose to that challenge when research ecologist Matt Reeves partnered with private industry and developed the Rangeland Production Monitoring Service (RPMS), an online tool for managing healthy rangelands that¡¯s available to everyone. A variety of maps are available through the Rangeland Production Monitoring Service including changes in forage amount and predictions of future forage availability. (Photo Credit: USDA Forest Service) The RPMS features maps and on rangeland forage between and and is updated every year. It also projects available forage in future growing seasons to help with annual operating plans and grazing permits. RPMS proved invaluable in and , when several Arizona counties experiencing severe drought were able to identify where available forage was most affected and planned accordingly. The RPMS application has also helped ranchers qualify for assistance through other programs like the Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP), which provides financial and technical assistance to agricultural producers to address environmental and resource concerns. Reeves worked with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to identify eligible ranchers, and developed a targeted conservation strategy as part of USDA Strategic Goals. The USDA Farm Service Agency is also using RPMS. Through its Livestock Forage Disaster Program, Forest Service permit holders and other producers may receive financial compensation due to forage loss. Users outside the livestock industry have also taken notice. Most recently, wildland fire managers are using the RPMS forage projections to estimate wildfire potential. While fires in national forests capture public attention, rangeland fires can burn just as often and can spread farther and faster than fires on the forest. ¡°We¡¯ve stepped up the game for the fire and fuels folks,¡± said Reeves. ¡°We¡¯re directly translating those projections into fuel so fire managers can make a weekly projection of the fire behavior.¡± Reeves envisions other uses for this , like how rangelands are managed under a changing climate. ¡°As managers and producers, we need to understand the impacts of our management and the climate that¡¯s been unfolding over the last 30 to 40 years,¡± he said. ¡°It¡¯s important to use this information for prioritizing where we might want to change our management scheme.¡± The Huachuca Mountains located in the Coronado National Forest are an example of the rangelands found in southern Arizona.

"A year-long monthly series of climate change science seminars have been developed by USDA¡¯s Office of Energy and Environmental Policy and the USDA Agriculture, Forestry, and Climate Science Working Group. These seminars are designed to provide USDA employees and key Cooperative Extension personnel with the scientific foundations of climate change, and an understanding of how climate change influences USDA¡¯s mission and daily work. The series features leading scientists, both internal and external to USDA, who provide information and respond to questions on a range of climate change related topics, including the foundational science of climate change, the effects of climate change on U.S. croplands, animal agriculture and forests, and the impact of climate extremes on agriculture and forests. These discussions are designed to be of use to USDA conservation, resource management, commodity, and service staff, and accessible to anyone, regardless of their level of familiarity of the subject matter. Climate Change 101: The Foundational Science Dr. Keith Dixon (NOAA) is an award winning science communicator with more than 30 years of experience as a research meteorologist and climate modeler. In the inaugural video of the climate seminar series, Dr. Dixon discusses what is known about our planet's changing climate, how that knowledge is developed, and how certain we are that humans are responsible for the change we are observing.  View on YouTube Climate Effects on U.S. Agriculture and Forests Climate change effects are already evident in U.S. forests and agroecosystems. We are on the cusp of additional and potentially more severe effects, primarily facilitated by increased frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events (drought, heavy rainfall, heat waves) and associated disturbances (wildfires, insect outbreaks).   View on YouTube Climate Extremes in Agriculture and Forests Atmospheric CO2 in the atmosphere is now likely higher than at any point in the last two million years. The effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 are interconnected, leading to changes in extremes in both weather and climate. USGS's Dr. Adam Terando discusses the consequences of changes in temperature, precipitation and drought to U.S. agriculture and forests, and approaches to adaptation.  View on YouTube -->  Climate Effects and Adaptation in Croplands Dr. Lisa Ainsworth, Research Leader of the USDA ARS Global Change and Photosynthesis Research Unit, speaks to USDA about the effects of recent and future climate change on croplands, how those changes impact global crop yields, and strategies for adaptation.  View on YouTube -->  Climate Effects and Adaption in Animal Agriculture Dr. Mark Boggess, Director of the U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, and Dr. Justin Derner, Research Leader of the Rangeland Resources and Systems Research Unit, discuss how climate change and increased weather variability impact animal production systems. Specific topic areas covered include the effects of heat stress on feedlot cattle, designing sustainable beef systems, climate change influences on rangelands, and options for adapting animal production systems to climate change.  View on YouTube -->  Climate Effects and Adaption in Forests Dr. Christopher J. Fettig, Dr. Maria K. Janowiak, and Dr. Jessica E. Halofsky discuss how climate change driven increases in temperature and variation in precipitation are impacting U.S. forests and the wide range of ecosystem services they provide, sharing opportunities to proactively address risks to forests, and providing concrete examples of adaptation strategies and tactics that can be leveraged by the federal government and private landowners.

Birdsey, a Senior Scientist with the Woodwell Climate Research Center, discusses the forest carbon cycle, the role of U.S. forests in mitigating climate change and helping the U.S. meet its net zero greenhouse gas emissions goal, and how conditions in the future may impact this critical carbon sink.  View on YouTube -->  Food Systems, Food Security, and Global Linkages Food systems both impact and are affected by climate change. Emissions come not only from farming, but also from the processing, manufacturing, distribution, storage, sale, and preparation of food, and the disposal of food wastes. Likewise, climate change influences not just agriculture, but activities that occur throughout this larger system. In this talk, Dr. Peters will address the fundamental concepts of food systems and food security. He will explain how scientists estimate climate emissions from individual supply chains and from whole food systems. He will also consider case study examples of strategies for reducing emissions viewed both from the production and consumer ends of the food system.  View on YouTube -->  Bringing People into the Science of Climate Change People are central to climate change. The size of climate change impacts, adaptation, and mitigation depend on human behavior¡ªby individuals, communities, businesses, industries, governments, trade partners, and their complex interactions.

"The Fifth U.S. National Climate Assessment, released on ?November ?14, , demonstrates how climate change is affecting America¡¯s working lands, how communities are reducing their risks, and how winning solutions to climate change can be found in productive landscapes. Mandated by the Global Change Research Act of and produced approximately every four years, the U.S. National Climate Assessment provides authoritative scientific information about climate change risks, impacts, and responses in the U.S.? Climate change is affecting agriculture, forests, rural communities, water, and natural resources across the U.S., and will continue to over the next century through changing temperatures, precipitation patterns, drought, flooding, and increasingly more severe extreme events, such as wildfires.?   Climate change affects the livelihoods of USDA¡¯s stakeholders, the economic conditions in which they operate, and the choices they must make regarding their operations in response to changing conditions.   While specific climate impacts vary based on regional conditions and context, no region of the Nation is immune from the impacts of climate change.  Impacts are not limited to U.S. agricultural and forest producers; they are felt globally through the supply chains that depend on working lands in the U.S. They are also felt by consumers in the U.S. who depend on globally-integrated food and forest-product supply chains.  Innovations in adapting to changes in climate show promise and will be central to the future success of working lands. However, frontline, rural, Tribal, and other historically underserved communities are disproportionately affected and may have differing capacities to adapt.   Agricultural and forest production have central roles to play in reducing the intensity of climate change and its impacts over the next century. View our Climate Solutions page to learn more about how USDA is meeting these challenges.

"Administrator, Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Jan 20,  USDA¡¯s Food and Nutrition Service is committed to providing equitable access to food to all Americans, but racial disparities in food security still exist. With the rate of food and nutrition insecurity higher among Black, Hispanic, and Native American populations, the bears this out. In response, both USDA and the Biden-Harris Administration have implemented programs targeting racial injustice and inequity in food and nutrition. Since January , FNS has worked tirelessly to combat the impacts of food insecurity and racial inequity by advancing WIC, providing equity in access to SNAP, expanding culturally appropriate meals for children, extending food assistance to American territories, and improving nutrition assistance for Tribal communities. Through these programs, USDA helps millions of Americans of all backgrounds receive access to nutritious foods. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) Self-Determination Demonstration Project, for instance, empowers Tribal Nations with more purchasing options to buy food that better aligns with culture and traditions. Since October , we¡¯ve awarded $3.5 million to eight Tribal Nations. ¡°This project is a big deal. It¡¯s a great showing of how FNS supports the interests of Indian Country to ensure more Tribal people have the chance to partake in Native foods grown by Native people,¡± said FNS Tribal Affairs Specialist Michael Ladd. In Wisconsin, the Oneida Nation and Menominee Indian Tribe have used the FDPIR project funds to purchase tribally procured meats, fish, and apples from the Oneida Nation Farm and the Oneida Nation Apple Orchard.

"Senior Policy Advisor for the Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Aug 18,  Tribal nations across what we now consider the Great Plains relied for millennia on their buffalo relatives for food, medicine, clothing, tools, and shelter. Yet today it is hard to find buffalo meat on school meal trays in the very areas where they once sustained Native communities. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) is working with tribal partners to figure out why and to remove the barriers we can. The Biden-Harris Administration and Secretary Vilsack have made it a priority to better meet our federal trust and treaty responsibilities. Historically, the U.S. government played a significant role in the decimation of the buffalo population in the North American continent, with a policy of destroying buffalo in order to starve Native Americans into submission. We recognize the weight of these actions and our obligation to better support tribes in restoring buffalo across their lands. On Monday, June 6, my colleagues at FNS, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Rural Development, Agricultural Marketing Service, and the USDA Office of Tribal Relations, and I were honored to be invited by the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC) and members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to participate in a traditional buffalo slaughter and field harvest. ITBC is a coalition of 69 federally recognized tribes that has led the work to restore buffalo to Indian Country since . Our traditional harvest was led by Lisa and Arlo Iron Cloud who work with Makoce Agriculture Development, an Indigenous agriculture organization led by Nick Hernandez on Pine Ridge. Ms. Iron Cloud is also partnering with USDA¡¯s Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative to help create resources on sustainable, Indigenous food foraging practices. This ¡°hands-on¡± experience was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for which we are so grateful to Lisa, Arlo, the ITBC, and the Oglala Lakota Nation Tribal leadership to get a glimpse into the cultural, spiritual, and practical contributions of buffalo to the Lakota people. We saw first-hand the importance of providing opportunities for American Indian children to engage in hands-on nutrition education about buffalo and to be able to taste and regularly eat buffalo as part of their school meals. FNS has worked to address some of the barriers that make it challenging for schools to serve buffalo, but we recognize that we must do more. We look forward to continuing to partner with ITBC and tribal leaders to advance Indigenous food sovereignty priorities and restore buffalo in Indian Country.

"USDA NASS Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Jun 16,  Farming is hot! From sweet corn to watermelon and apricots to tomatoes, a lot is growing on the farm this summer. Millions of producers across our nation continue to work tirelessly to produce safe and delicious food. According to the latest Census of Agriculture, more than a quarter of these producers are new and beginning farmers, proving that many people are unable to resist agriculture¡¯s magnetic appeal. USDA defines a beginning farmer as anyone who has farmed for 10 years or less. In , the United States had 908,274 producers who identified as beginning farmers, and they accounted for 27% of the country¡¯s 3.4 million producers. How old are these new farmers? The average age of a beginning farmer is 46.3, much younger than the average age of all farmers . Without a doubt, the art and science of producing food attracts people of all ages. If we look for younger farmers, we find 26% of beginning farmers are under the age of 35. The under 35 age group represents only 8% of all U.S. farmers overall. Will more young people find a match in farming as time goes on? Look for an update in the Census of Agriculture. States with the largest share of beginning farmers are mostly on the east and west coasts. However, just as Texas is the state with the most farms and the most producers, Texas leads in the number of beginning farmers.

(U.S. Forest Service photo) The 88-foot Engelmann spruce tree that will grace the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol as a gift from the people must first get from Colville National Forest in Washington State to Washington, D.C. That means careful packing with special attention paid to cocooning the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree so the thick branches stay intact and nothing hangs over the side of the trailer it is placed on. ¡°What does it take to wrap an 88-foot-tall Engelmann spruce?¡± said Franklin Pemberton of the Colville National Forest. ¡°Also a lot of hard-working volunteers, 4,000 feet of parachute cord with a 550-pound breaking strength and a huge building.¡± The tree wrapping process started at the harvest area on the Colville. Two large industrial cranes gently lowered the tree onto a custom-made cradle atop a special tractor trailer. ¡°The longest of the branches were tied up so they wouldn¡¯t drag on the road for the trip from the harvest site to the Newport (Wash.) celebration and then to the wrapping site,¡± Pemberton said. More than ate to help prep the tree for the journey. ¡°Once at the wrapping site, this is where the sticky, prickly and labor-intensive part of the process starts,¡± he said. ¡°Volunteers start to move the branches towards the center of the tree, using ratcheting straps to move the larger branches into place near the trunk so that the tree will fit inside its protective box trailer.¡± Keeping the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree from drying out is important during the 5,000-mile trip from Washington State to Washington, D.C. The end of the trunk is wrapped with a 40-gallon bladder that is refreshed throughout the trip. The tree needs more than 50 gallons of water each day to stay fresh. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Once those branches are tucked as close as they will go to the trunk, volunteers tie the branches in place with the parachute cord. While doing this, the trees pitch, or sap, covers the volunteer¡¯s hands, clothes and hair making for a sticky, but pleasant smelling ordeal. Once tucked away, the tree is cocooned by aluminum frame and plywood siding. Hoops straddle the top to provide support and protection for a decorative tarp. The only exposed parts of the tree can be seen through three viewing windows. Two of the windows will let onlookers see the top of the tree decorated with lights and a few of the thousands of ornaments created by children in Washington State. The third viewing area will give visitors a chance to see the 40-gallon bladder used to keep the thirsty tree moist and healthy along its trip. The tree will stop in 22 cities on the way to the Capitol. The tree is expected to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Nov. 24. On Nov. 25, the tree will be escorted into Washington, D.C. A tree lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 3. The tradition of a Christmas tree on the U.S. Capitol lawn began in . The first several years live trees were planted but did not thrive. In , the Capitol Architect asked the Forest Service for help. Since then, a national forest is chosen each year, and residents of the state where the forest in located work together with partners throughout the state to take care of a variety of logistical needs. The community buildup starts roughly a year in advance as a grass-roots community effort to give the gift to all Americans, which is why it is dubbed ¡°The People¡¯s Tree.¡± No tax dollars are used. However, Forest Service employees are assigned to help oversee the project. Follow the tree¡¯s journey. The Capitol Christmas Tree arrives in Colville, Wash. on its cross-country trip.

"Gopher Tortoise Habitats Thrive along Alabama's Gulf Coast  Longleaf pine forests once dominated the Southeast. But over the past two centuries, many of these forests have disappeared along with the wildlife that called them home. Recent efforts to enhance longleaf forests on private lands are helping the ecosystem rebound as well as wildlife like the gopher tortoise. The gopher tortoise is a keystone species of the longleaf forest, known for their deep burrows that provide vital habitat and shelter for not only itself but many other species. The gopher tortoise is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in the western part of the longleaf range, including parts of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government¡¯s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world¡¯s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack¡¯s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA¡¯s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization¡¯s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA¡¯s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA¡¯s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways. The Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice. The size of the gift matters much less than the fact that each employee participates on some level. DC Metro area federal employees can find out everything they need to know to get involved in CFC by visiting www.cfcnca.org.

"Pennsylvania Public Affairs Specialist in  Conservation  Rural  May 20,  Nuangola lakeside homes, surrounding roads and outbuildings, are experiencing little impact during the sewer extension construction project. As a sewer extension project winds through the lakeside community portion of Nuangola, Pennsylvania, residents are experiencing minimal impact.? Last year, Nuangola Borough received $4.4 million in USDA Rural Development Water and Environmental Program (WEP) loans and $3.9 million in WEP grants to fund the installation of a low pressure wastewater collection system for the borough. Treatment of the wastewater collected will be done by the neighboring authority¡¯s existing sewage treatment facility. The system will serve an estimated 420 homes. A unique aspect of the project is that directional boring will be used for the entire extension project.? Using the technology of directional boring allows the sewer pipe to be installed with minimal impact to the surrounding area, including homes, roads, and outbuildings.? The technique involves a bit at the end of a steel drill pipe, rotating an average of eight feet below ground level. By boring underground, homes, outbuildings, driveways and playground equipment are not impacted.? An L&N Zimmerman Boring employee is shown boring sewer pipe between two lakeside homes and alongside playground equipment.
