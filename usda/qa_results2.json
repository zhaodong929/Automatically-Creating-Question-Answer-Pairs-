        "task_1_result": "All Americans benefit from investments that provide consistent access to safe, healthy, affordable food, and COVID-19 revealed vulnerabilities in our food system. As we build back better, we must create new and better markets for all producers and consumers. The food system of the future needs to be fair, competitive, distributed, and resilient. The first step USDA took was to help producers get back on their feet through Pandemic Assistance. Now USDA is working to transform our Nation’s food system to create more options for producers and consumers and improve the resiliency of our food supply chain. The success of American agriculture hinges on research, innovation, and the development of new markets, both at home and abroad. Building a Resilient Food System USDA is helping build a food system that works better for everyone. The resource below provides a snapshot of more than 50 grant, loan, and technical assistance programs available to producers, rural development professionals, food businesses, grocers, schools, institutional purchasers, elected officials, anti-hunger organizations, and engaged citizens who are working together to build a more resilient food system for us all. Download English Handout (, 460 ) Descargar Folleto en Español (, 687 ) Transforming America’s Food System to Withstand Crises A strong and prosperous agricultural sector is essential to the well-being of the U.S. economy. America’s farmers and ranchers ensure a reliable food supply, support job growth, and promote economic development. By transforming the food system’s infrastructure and strengthening critical supply chains, USDA will ensure resilience against threats and disturbances and provide local and regional food systems with economic opportunities and security.  Learn more  USDA will build a more resilient food system by focusing on:  more resilient local and regional food production  fairer markets and options up and down the food system, from inputs through retail  ensuring access to safe, healthy, and nutritious food in all communities  building new markets and streams of income for farmers and producers using climate-smart food and forestry practices  making historic investments in infrastructure and clean energy capabilities in rural America, and  committing to equity across the Department by removing systemic barriers and building a workforce more representative of America. Creating More Markets at Home In response to the increased demand for local and regional foods caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, USDA will prioritize investments that expand the middle of the supply chain and strengthen local and regional food systems and ensure food supply chain resilience for the future.  Learn more  Build Resilient Food Systems, Infrastructure, and Supply Chain  USDA works tirelessly to ensure that the food system is fair, resilient, competitive, and distributed. By transforming the food system’s infrastructure and strengthening critical supply chains, USDA will ensure resilience against threats and disturbances and provide local and regional food systems with economic opportunities and security.  Expanding the Middle of the Supply Chain  Concentration in the middle of the food supply chain has left both farmers and ranchers with limited options to process, aggregate, and distribute their products, and has left consumers with limited options to purchase food to support their local economy. USDA is investing in expanding the middle of the supply chain to provide more options for both producers and consumers, and to make the food system more resilient and less reliant on limited options.  Strengthening Local and Regional Food Systems  In response to the increased demand for local and regional foods caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, USDA will prioritize investments that strengthen these markets and ensure food supply chain resilience for the future. Investing in local and regional food systems will further enhance the share of profits for those who grow, harvest, process, and prepare our food.  Learn more  Foster Agricultural Innovation and Sustainable Products that Enhance and Create Markets  The future of U.S. agriculture, which includes plant and animal agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture, depends on continued science, innovation, and process improvements supporting technological progress, production efficiencies, and environmental stewardship. Advancing areas with a focus on climate-smart agriculture will enable the creation of innovations to minimize the environmental footprint of agriculture and ensure sustainability while improving crop yields. New technologies and system designs are needed to produce higher value end products from agricultural products, emerging crops, livestock, and forest feedstocks. This will enable new markets, establish new domestic supply chains, and create more jobs and economic opportunities. Increasing productivity has significant social and economic benefits for society.  Biobased Fuels and Products  Biobased fuels and products create new opportunities for creating sustainable options for existing markets and for new markets with products with enhanced attributes of performance and sustainability. USDA is supporting this commitment through the increased development, purchase, and use of biobased products through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, BioPreferred Program, and Wood Innovations Program.  Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities  USDA is committed to supporting a diverse set of farmers, ranchers, and forest owners through climate solutions that increase resilience, expand market opportunities, and strengthen rural America. The new Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities opportunity provides up to $1 billion for pilot projects that create market opportunities for commodities produced using climate-smart practices.  USDA is now accepting project applications for fiscal year 2022.  Learn more Ensuring Fair Markets USDA is taking action to strengthen the rules and enforcement to support farmers and ranchers and create a food system of the future that is fair, competitive, distributed, and resilient. Learn more  Learn more  Partners in Fair and Competitive Markets  USDA is working with our partners at the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other White House Competition Council member agencies to fully utilize laws and regulations already on the books, and to bring bad actors to account.  Submit a complaint  A Modern Set of Packers and Stockyards Rules  USDA is preparing new proposed rules under the Packers and Stockyards Act to address poultry contracting and tournaments, unfair practices and undue preferences, and the harm to competition burdens from the courts. In the meantime, USDA is committed to the enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act to the maximum extent possible under a new enforcement policy announced in August 2021.  Product of USA/Consumer Transparency  USDA is already hard at work clarifying the “Product of USA” label for beef. American consumers depend upon accurate, transparent labels to obtain important information about the food they consume. American farmers and ranchers depend upon those same labels to convey information about their products that consumers value and demand. USDA is working to conduct consumer testing and economic analysis to support a rulemaking on the voluntary “Product of USA” label.  Price Transparency and Fairness in Livestock Trading  USDA remains committed to enhancing the transparency, price discovery function, and the fairness of the livestock markets using traditional Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) tools. In August of 2021, AMS through its Market News service announced two new reports that enhanced transparency in cattle markets for cattle traded today through contractual arrangements outside of the cash negotiated spot markets. Enhancing Markets Abroad With 20 percent of U.S. agricultural production exported to the rest of the world, trade is a critical engine powering the rural economy. USDA is pursuing a worker-oriented, market-focused, rules-based trade agenda that removes unfair barriers to U.S. exports, restores America’s reputation for reliability, and leads to new and better market opportunities for producers and agribusinesses of all types and sizes.  Learn more  Expanding international marketing opportunities for U.S. farmers and exporters is critical to fostering business and income growth across rural America. It is essential for USDA to continue its efforts to promote American agricultural products and exports through promotion activities, development of international standards, removal of trade barriers by monitoring and enforcing existing trade agreements, and negotiation of trade agreements that benefit the U.S. agricultural economy. USDA will also work with developing countries to grow their economies and facilitate trade, developing markets of the future for all our producers.  American agriculture posted its highest-ever annual export totals in 2021, with $177 billion in global sales of food and farm products. Those exports boost producers’ bottom lines, stimulate local economic activity, and support more than one million American jobs—both on the farm and in related industries such as food processing and transportation.  Expand All Producers’ Access to Global Markets Through Negotiation and Enforcement of Trade Agreements  USDA partners with the U.S. agricultural industry to boost global demand for the high-quality, cost-competitive American food and farm products that customers around the world need and want. Our export market development programs continue to yield results, generating an estimated $24.50 in exports for every $1 invested by government and industry.  Learn more  In the trade policy arena, we work with other Federal agencies, foreign governments, international organizations, and U.S. stakeholders to create a global environment that’s conducive to agricultural trade by knocking down trade barriers, negotiating and enforcing trade agreements, and establishing transparent and predictable rules and standards.  Learn more  Expand International Marketing Opportunities and Build Demand in Developing Countries Through Delivery of Technical Assistance and Capacity Building  We’re setting our sights on diversifying global markets for U.S. agriculture. In places like Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia, we’re seeing rapid GDP growth, expanding middle classes, urbanizing populations, and increasingly modern food retail systems. That all adds up to exciting new export prospects, which USDA is helping to unlock.  Learn more  Protect Agricultural Health by Minimizing Major Diseases, Pests, and Wildlife Conflicts  The impacts of pests, diseases, and wildlife conflicts on agricultural production, commerce, and trade can be immense. USDA must balance keeping American agriculture safe while expanding access to new agricultural markets all across the globe. Domestically, USDA conducts emergency response activities that minimize threats and their impacts on agricultural industries, adapting to changes in agricultural risk by adjusting available resources to address these threats. Concurrently, the Department embarks on collaborative research to develop pest-resistant strains of crops and new animal-disease vaccines, expedites the approval of new treatments, and develops strategies to prevent and mitigate damage related to conflicts with wildlife.

        "task_1_result": "Climate Change Affects U.S. Agriculture and Rural Communities Climate change presents real threats to U.S. agricultural production, forest resources, and rural economies. Producers and land managers across the country are experiencing climate impacts on their operations through shifting weather patterns and increasingly frequent and severe storms, floods, drought, and wildfire.  Learn more  These threats have significant implications—not just for farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners—but also for surrounding communities and all Americans.  The Department is developing a comprehensive strategy centered on voluntary incentives that is inclusive for all agricultural producers, landowners, and communities, and that builds on the 90-Day Progress Report on Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry (, 561 ).  Additionally, USDA’s Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience outlines action items to address the most significant climate risks to agriculture, forestry, and rural communities.  The Fourth National Climate Assessment details how climate change is affecting various land uses in different regions of the United States. Agriculture Plays a Critical Role in Delivering Climate Change Solutions The American agriculture sector has an incredible potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon, and deliver lasting solutions to the climate crisis. America’s producers are already leading the way. In recent years, carbon stored in cultivated cropland soils increased by more than 8.8 million tons annually (, 1.9 MB) thanks to their voluntary conservation efforts. Farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners are ready, and USDA offers resources to help.  Learn more  USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service provides financial assistance and one-on-one technical support to assist producers in implementing climate-smart conservation practices such as no-till, cover crops, prescribed grazing, and silvopasture. This empowers producers to both strengthen their operation’s resilience to climate-related disaster events while leveraging their land’s potential to sequester and store carbon, thereby delivering lasting climate solutions.  A suite of resources for agricultural producers and conservation partners is available at farmers.gov/climate-smart. Producers may contact the NRCS office at their local USDA Service Center to learn more. Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities Funding Opportunity USDA is investing up to $2.8 billion in 70 selected projects under the first pool of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding opportunity, with projects from the second funding pool to be announced later this year. This effort will increase the competitive advantage of U.S. agriculture both domestically and internationally, build wealth that stays in rural communities, and support a diverse range of producers and operation types.  Learn more  On February 7, 2022, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would invest $1 billion in partnerships to expand market opportunities for climate-smart commodities and support America’s climate-smart farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners. Because of the unprecedented demand and interest in Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, and the potential for meaningful opportunities to benefit producers through the proposals, USDA has tripled this commitment to more than $3 billion. On September 14, 2022, Secretary Vilsack announced USDA is investing up to $2.8 billion in 70 selected projects under the first funding pool of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding opportunity, with projects from the second funding pool to be announced later this year.  Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities will finance pilot projects that create market opportunities for U.S. agricultural and forestry products that use climate-smart practices and include innovative, cost-effective ways to measure and verify greenhouse gas benefits. USDA is no longer accepting project applications for this funding opportunity.  This funding opportunity defines climate-smart commodities as being produced using agricultural (farming, ranching, or forestry) practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon. Funding will be provided to partners through the USDA’s Commodity Credit Corporation for pilot projects. Spanning up to five years, the 70 projects announced on September 14 will:  Provide technical and financial assistance to producers to implement climate-smart production practices on a voluntary basis on working lands;  Pilot innovative and cost-effective methods for quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas benefits; and  Develop markets and promote the resulting climate-smart commodities.  USDA anticipates that these 70 projects will result in:  Hundreds of expanded markets and revenue streams for producers and commodities across agriculture ranging from traditional corn to specialty crops.  More than 50 thousand farms reached, encompassing over 20-25 million acres of working land engaged in climate-smart production practices such as cover crops, no-till and nutrient management.  More than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestered over the lives of the projects. This is equivalent to removing more than 10 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year.  More than 50 universities, including multiple minority-serving institutions, engaged and helping advance projects, especially with outreach and monitoring, measurement, reporting and verification.  Proposals for the 70 selected projects include plans to match on average over 50% of the federal investment with nonfederal funds.  This infographic (PNG, 1.0 MB) includes additional metrics on projects from the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities first funding pool.  Visit www.usda.gov/climate-solutions/climate-smart-commodities for additional information, including details on the two funding pools and the full list of projects announced in September 2022. Combatting the Causes and Effects of Climate Change Since January 2021, USDA has announced a suite of updates to the Department’s programs, positioning farmers, ranchers, forest landowners, and rural communities to be leaders in emissions reductions and carbon sequestration and supporting them in managing the impacts of climate change.  Learn more  Reports and Strategies  A 90-Day Progress Report on a Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry Strategy, which provides recommendations and next steps to support the Department in implementing climate solutions in ways that build strong communities, fair markets, and are inclusive of all Tribes and stakeholders.  The Action Plan for Climate Adaptation and Resilience (, 813 ) (USDA’s Adaptation Plan) describes how USDA will integrate climate adaptation into its mission, programs, operations, and management. The USDA Climate Hubs will continue to play a leading role across USDA to put \"Adaptation in Action\" by connecting science and practice and through tailored outreach activities.  USDA Agency’s Climate Adaptation Plans identify the risks climate change poses to their missions, and actions they will take to manage these risks to better help agricultural producers, forest landowners, and communities across the country face the effects of a changing climate.  Visit www.usda.gov/climate-solutions/climate-adaptation-usda to learn more about climate risks and USDA’s actions.  The Biden-Harris Administration released the Nature-Based Solutions Roadmap (, 1.3 MB) in November 2022, an outline of strategic recommendations to unlock the potential of nature-based solutions to address climate change, nature loss, and inequity. A companion document, The Nature-Based Solutions Resource Guide: Compendium of Federal Examples, Guidance, Resource Documents, Tools and Technical Assistance (, 850 ) includes examples of nature-based solutions and over 150 resources, including those from USDA.  Conservation and Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry  Expanded conservation program opportunities to support climate-smart agriculture in 2022, including nationwide availability of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) Conservation Incentive Contracts option, a new and streamlined EQIP Cover Crop Initiative, and added flexibilities for producers to easily re-enroll in the Conservation Stewardship Program.  $50 million invested in 118 partnerships to expand access to conservation assistance for climate-smart agriculture and forestry. The Equity Conservation Cooperative Agreements, administered by NRCS, will fund 2-year projects to expand the delivery of conservation assistance to farmers who are new to farming, low income, socially disadvantaged, or military veterans.  $10 million invested in NRCS’s Environmental Quality Incentives Program to support climate-smart conservation practices in ates in fiscal year 2021, with lessons learned informing a national rollout planned for fiscal year 2022.

        "task_1_result": "What is nutrition security? Building on and complementing our long-standing efforts to address food security, we are expanding our efforts to advance food and nutrition security. Nutrition security means all Americans have consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being. Our approach to tackling food and nutrition insecurity aims to:  Recognize that structural inequities make it hard for many people to eat healthy and be physically active; and  Emphasize taking an equity lens to our efforts.  Learn more  A household is food secure if all members, at all times, can access enough food for an active, healthy life. At a minimum, food security includes:  Readily available nutritionally adequate and safe foods, and  The ability to acquire those foods in socially acceptable ways (without resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies).  Nutrition security means consistent access, availability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being, prevent disease, and, if needed, treat disease, particularly among racial/ethnic minority, lower income, and rural and remote populations including Tribal communities and Insular areas. Nutrition security is an emerging concept that complements efforts to increase food security while also:  Recognizing that Americans, in general, fall short of an active, healthy lifestyle aligned with Federal dietary and physical activity guidelines, and  Emphasizing equity to ensure our efforts serve all populations to promote access, availability, and affordability to foods and beverages, and address the connection between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases. View the Infographic (, 420 ) What is the problem? Poor nutrition is a leading cause of illness in the United States, associated with more than half a million deaths per year. It is linked with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease as well as broader impacts including higher health care costs and decreased productivity.  Learn more  Poor nutrition is widespread  Though poor nutrition affects every demographic, diet-related diseases hit harder among historically underserved communities.  The overall diet quality score for Americans is 59 out of 100, indicating that the average American diet does not align with Federal dietary recommendations. However, the resulting health burden is not equally shared. Certain populations are at greater risk for diet-related disease. For example, Black and Indigenous children are more likely to have obesity than their white peers. Those who face food insecurity are also at greater risk.  Beyond the effect on health, poor nutrition and diet-related diseases have far-reaching impacts including decreased academic achievement and increased financial stress. That translates to societal impacts as well—lower productivity, weakened military readiness, widening health disparities, and skyrocketing health care costs. For example, approximately 85 percent of current health care spending is related to management of diet-related chronic disease.  To make progress on these problems, Americans need equitable access to healthy foods that promote well-being. What is USDA doing? USDA wants input from all Americans on ways we can improve nutrition security. The department is particularly focused on strengthening and building new partnerships with all levels of government, the private sector, community-based organizations, and families. Together, we can make progress that will change lives and ensure a healthier, more prosperous future for all Americans.  Learn more  USDA’s work to advance nutrition security focuses on four pillars:  Meaningful Support  Healthy Food  Collaborative Action  Equitable Systems  Research and evaluation  USDA’s work on nutrition security is driven by research and grounded in science. In addition to the extensive research performed by the Food and Nutrition Service, the Agricultural Research Service has six human nutrition research centers, the Economic Research Service studies numerous topics central to food and nutrition security, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture advances food and nutrition security through research, education, extension, and innovation. Our work is also driven by the lived experiences – of our staff and our stakeholders.  Learn more about our nutrition security research.

        "task_3_answer": "According to the content, there is a strong connection between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases, particularly in historically underserved communities. The text states that \"those who face food insecurity are also at greater risk\" for diet-related disease, which indicates that individuals who struggle with accessing sufficient nutritious food are more likely to experience poor health outcomes.\n\nFurthermore, the content highlights that certain populations, such as Black and Indigenous children, are more likely to have obesity than their white peers, suggesting a link between food insecurity and diet-related diseases in these communities. Additionally, it is mentioned that \"approximately 85 percent of current health care spending is related to management of diet-related chronic disease,\" emphasizing the significant impact of diet-related diseases on overall health and economic burdens.\n\nUSDA's efforts to advance nutrition security aim to address this issue by ensuring equitable access to healthy foods, particularly for historically underserved communities. By acknowledging the structural inequities that make it difficult for many people to eat healthy and be physically active, USDA is taking a crucial step towards mitigating the negative consequences of food insecurity on diet-related chronic diseases.\n\nIn summary, the relationship between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases is one of causality, where individuals who struggle with accessing sufficient nutritious food are more likely to experience poor health outcomes, particularly in historically underserved communities. USDA's efforts to advance nutrition security aim to address this issue by promoting equitable access to healthy foods."

To accomplish this mission, we must, together, build and maintain public trust and confidence among USDA stakeholders that this truly is, in the words of President Lincoln, the “People’s Department”. We must: (1) identify and root out systemic discrimination in USDA programs; (2) ensure equitable access to USDA programs and services for all communities, including by removing barriers to access and working to repair past mistakes that have resulted in economic, social, and racial disparities; and (3) promote nutrition security, a healthy environment, and the opportunity for a good life for every person, in every community in America.

The program is part of the Department’s ongoing effort to keep borrowers farming, remove obstacles that currently prevent many borrowers from returning to their land, and improve the way that USDA approaches borrowing and loan servicing in the long-term.  Additional $208 million in assistance announced November 30, 2023 to help prevent guaranteed borrower foreclosures and to assist emergency loan borrowers  Additional assistance announced August 11, 2023 for qualifying guaranteed loan borrowers facing financial risk  The deadline to request extraordinary measures assistance and cash flow-based assistance was December 31, 2023. All requests submitted prior to the December 31, 2023 deadline are currently being reviewed.  Prior assistance: October 2022 ($800 million) & May 2023 ($130 million) More USDA Equity NewsUSDA Equity Accomplishments and Resources Making Equity a Priority Over the course of its existence, USDA has faced several pivotal moments—times when our direction and efforts can fundamentally reshape the lives of agricultural producers, rural Americans, our country, and the world. Today, we are at such a moment. We must decide—Do we want to continue to use a system that benefits only a few or do we want a system that benefits all? USDA and the Biden-Harris Administration recognize that meeting this moment for all Americans means transforming the current system.   USDA’s work is not just about farms and the people who work them and their associated processes.  It’s about keeping businesses alive in small towns.  It’s about school children having access to healthy food grown in their own communities.  It’s about protecting our planet from droughts and wildfires and natural disasters.  It’s about America leading the way in what it means to be a sustainable, inclusive, resilient place. Centering equity in this work is essential. EQUITY IS: the consistent and systematic treatment of all individuals in a fair, just, and impartial manner, including individuals who belong to communities that often have been denied such treatment, such as Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander persons and other persons of color; members of religious minorities; women and girls; LGBTQI+ persons; persons with disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; persons who live in United States Territories; persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality; and individuals who belong to multiple such communities. FROM CONCEPT TO ACTION: USDA has mobilized, department-wide, to remove barriers to access to our programs and services for all Americans, including ensuring USDA resources reach underserved communities and those with the most need.

Achieving environmental justice, as outlined in Executive Order (EO) 12898 from 1994 and EO 14096 from 2023, is contingent on equitable access to a healthy, sustainable, and resilient environment in which to live, play, work, learn, grow, worship, and engage in cultural and subsistence practices.  Our Commitment to You  Given that USDA's programs impact almost every American every day, the Department is well positioned to support the development of inclusive, sustainable economies, protection from environmental harms, and equitable investment by USDA programs and services across diverse landscapes and communities. USDA’s vision for environmental justice is not only to institutionalize environmental justice principles across USDA, but to continuously improve our ability to equitably serve all Americans and make a positive difference in the lives of communities that have been overburdened and underserved.  How might USDA’s commitment and efforts impact me or my community?  USDA is committed to serving all Americans by providing effective, innovative, science-based public policy leadership in agriculture, food and nutrition, natural resource protection and management, rural development, and equitable delivery of climate-smart opportunities that inspire and help Americans to thrive.  USDA is committed to supporting inclusive, sustainable economies; mitigating legacy pollution; protecting communities from environmental hazards; promoting climate-smart solutions to agriculture and energy; implementing consistent, meaningful public engagement; and addressing barriers to access of federal resources, services, and programs.  USDA is committed to, to the degree feasible, minimizing the disproportionately high and adverse impacts of its activities and investments on communities with environmental justice concerns and to addressing and resolving environmental justice issues and complaints as they arise.  USDA is committed to integrating the best education, research, outreach, and technical assistance into programs so they meet the needs of our stakeholders and customers in communities with environmental justice concerns.  USDA is committed to working collaboratively with federal, Tribal, state, and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and private individuals to address the underlying conditions that put people and communities at risk and to assisting communities across the Nation in striving to achieve environmentally suitable living and working conditions.  USDA is committed to increasing the awareness, skills, and abilities of USDA leadership and staff regarding environmental justice and will strive to ensure sufficient capacity to support work related to environmental justice.  USDA Environmental Justice Strategic Plan  Please check back soon for USDA’s forthcoming Environmental Justice Strategic Plan.  Environmental Justice Scorecard  The annual White House Environmental Justice Scorecard is the first-ever government-wide assessment of actions the Federal government is taking to advance environmental justice. USDA’s Scorecards assess the Department’s investments and actions associated with the Justice40 Initiative, efforts in support of the Civil Rights Act and other laws, and the Department's progress in institutionalizing environmental justice through staffing, policies, activities, stakeholder engagement, and decision processes.  You may view USDA’s Phase Two Environmental Justice Scorecard, covering activities and accomplishments from October 1st, 2022, through September 30, 2023. You may also view USDA’s Phase One Scorecard, covering activities and accomplishments from October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022.  The Justice40 Initiative  The Justice40 Initiative, launched through Executive Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, sets a government-wide goal of directing 40% of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments from covered programs to flow to disadvantaged communities that have been marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.  As of November of 2023, USDA has 70 Justice40 Initiative covered programs that achieve outcomes related to: climate change, clean energy, energy efficiency, clean transportation, affordable and sustainable housing, training and workforce development, environmental remediation, and reduction of legacy pollution, as well as infrastructure development for clean water and wastewater. Strategy for Impact In response to Executive Order 13985, Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities through the Federal Government, and Executive Order 14091, Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities through the Federal Government, USDA has adopted seven department-wide strategies to advance equity over the coming year:  Broaden access to agricultural programs. Ensure agricultural resources and assistance for producers are broadly accessible, while creating new, more, and better market opportunities so USDA policies and programs advance agriculture for all who want to participate, not just a few, promoting rural prosperity and economic security.  Promote rural prosperity. Promote prosperity and economic security in rural communities by empowering people with modern infrastructure, connecting business owners to new opportunities for growth, and supporting community-driven solutions to build brighter futures in rural America.  Promote nutrition security. Promote nutrition security and health equity through USDA nutrition assistance programs to ensure all Americans have access to the nutrition they need.  Broaden access to forest resources and outdoor experiences. Ensure equitable access to forest resources, funding opportunities, and outdoor experiences; and target wildfire prevention and conservation investments where they are most needed.  Advance equity in federal procurement by providing underserved and disadvantaged businesses tools and resources to increase access to funding opportunities and by helping promote safe and secure provision of services and supplies.  Empower tribal sovereignty. Empower tribal sovereignty and uphold treaty responsibilities to Indian tribes, removing barriers to access USDA programs and incorporating indigenous values and perspectives in program design and delivery.  Protect civil rights. Commit unwaveringly to civil rights by improving tools, skills, capacity, and processes to more effectively and efficiently enforce them. These strategies update USDA’s 2022 Equity Action Plan, learning from hundreds of engagements with our customers and would-be customers—through listening sessions, requests for information, outreach events, tribal consultations, and advisory committees (including, preeminently, USDA’s Equity Commission). We will operationalize our goals using 1. Reduce administrative, economic, historical, and other barriers to program access, and ensuring our programs include processes to observe, understand, and remove or mitigate such barriers. #ReduceBarriers 2. Partner with trusted technical assistance providers to ensure that underserved producers and communities have the support they need to access USDA programs. #Partner 3. Direct USDA programs to those who need them the most. #MeetNeeds 4. Operate transparently and accountably, providing the information on Department programs that Congress, stakeholders, and the general public need to hold us to account on our equity agenda, and working systematically to collect and take account of public feedback. #Transparency Equity Accomplishments For more on USDA’s equity strategy and progress since 2021, visit the Equity Accomplishments page and the Equity Action Plans page.

This will ensure everyone has a fair shot at resources, begin closing the racial wealth gap, and address longstanding inequities in agriculture. In October 2023, the body finalized its work by voting on a total of 66 recommendations that will be included in the Final Report to be published in 2024. The work of the Equity Commission is empowering USDA to objectively confront the hard reality of past and help build back better by serving our customers fairly and equitably. Learn more Building a More Diverse USDA Leading with Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access Front and Center: USDA’s commitment to diversity and equity includes both committed leadership and strong policy. USDA has issued a robust diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) strategic plan and has hired a Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer (CDIO) and other staff to implement it. The CDIO leads USDAʼs work to build an organization that reflects the diversity of the communities USDA serves, bringing the best talent to USDA, retaining and investing in our workforce, and creating a culture where everyone feels welcomed. At the core of USDAʼs Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility Strategic Plan are six focus areas for the next five years:  Build a culture that drives trust, belonging, transparency, accountability, and employee empathy.  Achieve a workforce representative of Americans that inspires development of innovative ideas and best practices.  Foster a workplace environment that is physically, mentally, and emotionally safe.  Establish leadership and governance structures to support long-term and sustainable DEIA efforts.  Promote empowerment, responsibility, and accountability for DEIA through developing the workforce.  Demonstrate a commitment to a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible USDA through accountability, data collection, analysis, and effective policymaking.
