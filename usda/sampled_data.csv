"Initiatives  Aug 11,   The Obama administration has called on Americans from all backgrounds and walks of life to work to improve their communities as part of the United We Serve project. Here at USDA, many of our more than 100,000 employees are doing their part. They are driven to serve, and proud to identify ways to use their skills to support their own communities. Here's some work two USDA employees are doing to improve the health of their communities: Horseback riding for people with special needs — Mike (Annandale, VA) Mike and his family have long been involved with the equestrian sport of vaulting (gymnastics on horseback). Over the past year they have hosted a regular outing for special needs children and adults from their church, giving each an opportunity to ride a horse and to learn the freedom of movement and confidence the experience brings. Nothing can compare with the sheer pleasure of seeing these individuals, often initially nervous and scared, beaming as they ride triumphantly...and often for the first time in their lives. Perhaps the most meaningful experience was last October when, during local pony rides Mike was helping with, he saw a mother with an infant whose many tubes and blank stare evidenced the severity of his condition. He asked the mother if her baby wanted a chance to ride and he was soon up on a horse in the secure arms of an experienced rider. After a 5-minute ride his mother thanked Mike and later told him that her baby was normally mostly uncommunicative, but that after riding he seemed to be alert and aware for days! Raising money for a cure — Nancy (Steele, ND) Nancy coordinated the local USDA Service Center’s team for the American Cancer Society’s ""Relay for Life"" fundraiser in Steele, North Dakota. They named their group ""Team USDA"" and over a few short months raised over $. ""Team USDA"" was the top fundraising team from within the 23 teams that participated. Some of the ways they raised funds were by serving dinners for local events, selling sweets and treats, and family and friends making donations. The 23 teams for this event raised over $40,000. It was a great success and they plan to participate again next year.

"Agricultural Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Dec 27,  Make sure these “good luck” foods and all food count. Be a part of the Census of Agriculture. The Census is a complete count of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. The holidays are often a time for family, fun, and food. New Year’s is no exception. One thing many nations around the world have in common is the belief that eating certain foods on New Year’s will bring good luck and prosperity in the 12 months to follow. One New Year’s tradition the South is especially known for is eating black-eyed peas and collard greens. It is believed that a meal with black-eyed peas and collards symbolizes humility and a new year full of coins and “green” (money). Lentils are another popular legume on New Year’s for the same reason. How do our farmers contribute to this traditional fare? According to the Census of Agriculture, our nation’s 1,407 collard operations harvested 12,542 acres. North Carolina ranked first for number of farms , but Georgia led in collard acreage . The for collards are only available every five years in the Census of Agriculture, and it’s that time again. Census questionnaires have been mailed to farmers and ranchers across the nation. By participating in the Census of Agriculture, producers can influence decisions that will shape the future of American agriculture.  In , California ranked first in black-eyed pea production, accounting for 31.9 million of the 57.2 million pounds produced nationally. Texas ranked first in harvested acres, with 23,000 of the nation’s 35,300 total harvested acres of black-eyed peas. In the same year, farmers produced 1.3 billion pounds of lentils on 908,000 harvested acres. Montana ranked first in lentil production, with more than 737 million pounds. Pork is another popular New Year’s tradition. In various cultures, pigs are perceived as representing progress because they look and root forward. In , U.S. farmers produced more than 35 billion pounds of pork, with Iowa, at more than 12 billion pounds, accounting for almost a third of U.S. production. According to the Census of Agriculture, there were 63,246 hog operations across the country. Iowa led the nation with 6,266 operations. What will the Census of Agriculture tell us? A fun New Year’s tradition is trying to eat 12 grapes at midnight. Some believe that each chime of the clock represents a month of the year and that the reveler must eat one grape with each chime for 12 months of good luck. Some even say you should make a wish with each grape. According to the Census of Agriculture, our nation had 23,420 grape bearing operations and more than 1 million bearing acres. In , the United States produced 7.7 million tons of grapes, of which about 1 million were utilized as fresh grapes. California is consistently first in grape production. The census will provide additional information on number of grape operations and acres. Across the United States and around the world, people incorporate a variety of other New Year’s food traditions, including eating noodles to symbolize a long life, ring-shaped cakes to represent the year coming full circle, and many more.

"USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 11,   Reducing rental housing operating expenses, preserving the environment and promoting local energy sources is a priority for USDA Rural Development, demonstrated by green-energy initiatives like the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) and the Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program. Rural Development is now offering the Multi-Family Housing Energy Efficiency Initiative as part of the existing application process for Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Program for New Construction, Section 514 Farm Labor Housing Loans and Section 516 Farm Labor Housing Grants for Off-Farm Housing, Section 522 Housing Preservation Grants, and Sections 514, 515 and 516 Multi-Family Housing Revitalization Demonstration Programs.  This new initiative aims to promote development projects that make an effort to reduce energy use, reduce energy from the energy grid supply, have little or no net emission of greenhouse gasses, and are economically viable. The Energy Efficiency Initiative focuses on three areas: energy conservation, energy generation, and green property management.  Points are given to applicants for energy efficiency certifications, use of energy efficient building materials and design strategies, generation of energy on site, and commitments to energy efficient post-construction operation and maintenance.  Through administration of this initiative combined with existing Rural Development programs, USDA hopes to reduce the need for outside energy sources, reduce energy costs, promote the economy, and ultimately secure a better environment for future generations. Several green energy projects funded by  Rural Development are already experiencing the many benefits of conserving energy.  In Kings County, NJ USDA-RD provided a Section 515 loan and Section 538 Guaranteed Rural Rental Housing Program (GRRHP) loan to aid in the construction of 57 rental units for low-income residents.  The construction development, called Montgomery Crossing, employs a 28.1 kWh photovoltaic system, saving over 25 percent of annual electricity costs.  The development also features insulated vinyl siding, water-efficient fixtures, and landscaping plants with low water needs.  Other successful green projects include the Rancho Lindo Apartments development in Kern County, CA and the Harvest Point Apartments in Salem, NJ.

"US Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Mar 02,  The legacy of the Weeks Act is shown by looking at photos of the White Mountain National Forest a century apart. Nearly a 100 years later after being decimated by logging, this photo depicts a healthy restored forest at the same location.  The Weeks Act, which went into effect on March 1, , has been identified as one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation in American history. In the early s the public began to embrace a more proactive attitude toward conserving public lands. Just the year before, in , Gifford Pinchot started the Forest Service. Before the Weeks Act, lands set aside for conservation were all located in the West and were created from large blocks of land in the public domain. Millions of acres of bare, eroded lands dotted the Eastern states from cut-over and farmed-out lands. In the West, the epic wildfires of fueled support for the Act. The most poignant element of the Act was that it gave the federal government authority to buy private lands in the East to establish publicly-owned forests. This provided both immediate and long-term benefits: the immediate protection of eastern watersheds from further development; the creation of a long-term effort to restore forests on public lands; and the beginning of new federal-state cooperative partnership responsibilities to protect these lands from intense and damaging wildfires. The Act’s natural resource conservation success has been profound: it designated 52 national forests in 26 Eastern states and mandated conservation ethics on some 20 million acres of national forests and grasslands across 41 states and Puerto Rico. Today, 80% of the 155 national forests are comprised of lands acquired through the Weeks Act, sustainably managed for a wide variety of conservation purposes. The impact of the Weeks Act is still strong today. America relies on the treasures their forests provide, including clean water, wildlife habitat, recreation, forest products, and a wide range of goods and services. The conservation successes of historic partnerships that created many of our beautiful national forests are an integral part of how the Forest Service continues to do business. The Act has a rich legacy, and the Forest Service remains committed to the tenets of its conservation core and values. The results of the Act support local economies and communities and broad tourism and recreation business sectors, and will extend our natural resource heritage far into the next 100 years.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Apr 10,  EFNEP provides food and nutrition information to limited-resource families, including how to understand the nutrition information provided on food labels. (iStock image) Educators from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories recently met in Arlington, Virginia to discuss local implementation of the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), one of the nation’s largest nutrition education programs. Through nutrition education, EFNEP helps limited-resource families and children gain the knowledge and skills to change their current attitudes and behaviors when it comes to choosing nutritionally sound diets and improve their health and well-being.  USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers EFNEP and provides national program leadership. “The EFNEP Conference brought together about 170 representatives from and land-grant universities (LGUs) to coordinate, collaborate, and receive training that they can take back and implement in their respective university programs,” said Stephanie Blake, NIFA EFNEP program coordinator. Conference agenda items included an update on changes to packaged food nutrition labels, youth participant evaluation forms, a new adult behavior checklist, and an Internet tool used for EFNEP evaluation and reporting called the Web-Based Nutrition Education Evaluation and Reporting System.  EFNEP coordinators also shared ideas and resources through breakout session presentations and poster exhibits. EFNEP has assisted more than 32 million families and youth since the program’s inception in .  Last year, EFNEP reached nearly 122,000 adults and 400,000 children directly and about 360,000 family members indirectly.  Among the results listed in EFNEP’s Impacts Report, 94 percent of adult participants reported improved diets, 86 percent of youth participants reported an increased ability to choose healthy food, and 84 percent of adults reported being better able to manage food resources. “EFNEP is about reducing health disparities of some this nation’s most vulnerable audiences through hands-on learning experiences and interactive nutrition education,” said Helen Chipman, NIFA national program leader for food and nutrition education.  “This annual meeting, combined with other cooperative state and federal efforts, improves EFNEP’s ability to promote nutritional health and well-being among low-income families and children.” While LGUs manage state EFNEP programs, local educators run them at the county level.  “Our educators are so successful because they are members of the communities they support and dedicated to reaching diverse, low-income populations,” Blake said. Contact your local Cooperative Extension office for more EFNEP information. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Oct 31,  A wasp works its way out of an aphid mummy after developing inside as larvae. (Photo courtesy of the ARS Electron and Confocal Microscopy Unit) At Halloween, people revel in ghosts, goblins, and things that go bump in the night. Not all are in books or movies, though. There are plenty of creepy critters doing downright scary things every day in your own backyard. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, since many of these “monsters” are actually good guys getting the bad guys out of town; it’s just not always pleasant to watch. Fire ants are common in subtropical Southeastern states and have shown up as far west as California. These stinging ants are not just painful pests; they’re also a bane to agriculture, feeding on young plants and seeds, causing an estimated crop loss of $750 million per year. There are many ways to control or eliminate fire ants, but nature provides one that is tailor made for the silver screen! Enter the phorid fly, a natural predator of the fire ant. The fly swoops in on its target and deposits an egg into the ant. After hatching inside the ant, the maggot works its way into the ant’s head, where it lives for a couple of weeks, feeding on bodily fluids. The maggot then releases chemicals that eat away at the ant’s body until its head falls off. The maggot then stays in the severed head and feeds on brains until it reaches maturity and breaks out through the ant’s mouth. Like zombies? You will, if you don’t like cockroaches. The jewel wasp injects a serum into its victim, which “zombifies” the roach into submitting to its will. The passive zombie roach allows the wasp to lead it by an antenna into a nest, which quickly becomes a nursery after the wasp lays its egg. As with the phorid fly larvae, it feeds off its host until it reaches maturity. Mummies also abound in gardens and fields, courtesy of a pair of wasps. These wasps (Aphidiinae braconid wasps – pictured – and Pteromalid chaclid wasps) also deposit an egg inside the body of their prey, this time an aphid. The wasp larvae grow inside the aphid, which soon becomes mummified in that it turns inflated, rigid, and off-color. After the larva becomes an adult wasp, it chews its way out, leaving the mummy husk behind. “Husks are fun to collect and are routinely encountered in gardens,” said Matt Buffington, a research scientist with the Agricultural Research Service’s Systematic Entomology Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. “In fact, if you have them, it’s a good sign your aphid problems are being somewhat controlled.” Aphids are a scourge to crops and horticulture, where they suck on sap, which causes yellowing, stunting, distortion of plant parts, leaf mold, and, in cotton, poor fiber quality. Aphids can also transmit plant viruses. Not to be outdone, some bees (Trigona hypogea) make an appearance as scavenger vampires. “Instead of providing their young with protein from pollen, vampire bees gather protein from carcasses on the forest floor,” Buffington said. “Further, they have unique jaws for tearing into dead animal flesh and cutting it into pieces for transport and digestion.” There are plenty of other examples of insects that exemplify Halloween, but one of the spookiest is actually a mammal – the humble bat. If you can get past the vampire nature of some bats, you’ll find that many species of bats are great friends of plants; they pollinate, spread seeds, and feed on pesky bugs. So, on All Hallows’ Eve, as you’re greeting young ghosts and goblins doing their rounds of trick-or-treating, don’t forget about those beneficial creepy critters in your own backyard.

"New Web-Based Tool Helps Land Managers Plan for Forests' Future  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. From South Carolina’s coastal plain to the North Carolina mountains to the tropics of Puerto Rico to the southern Sierra Nevada region of California, climate change is on the minds of forest planners. That’s because U.S. Forest Service planning teams in these areas are among the first to revise their land and resource management plans under the Planning Rule. To help them in their planning, land managers from the Francis Marion, Nantahala, Pisgah, El Yunque, Inyo, Sequoia, and Sierra national forests will turn to a web-based tool known as the Template for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Management Options. Forest Plans help guide the management of national forests and are typically revised every 10 to 15 years. The plans help ensure that national forests and grasslands continue to meet the requirements of the National Forest Management Act—for clean air and water, timber and other forest products, wildlife habitat, recreation and more.

"USDA Public Information Officer in  Rural  Feb 06,  A houseboat manufacturer in Kentucky builds a prototype energy-efficient single family home with support from the University of Kentucky, USDA Rural Development and other partners. A ribbon cutting was held last month, for the first prototype from the University of Kentucky’s (UK) Houseboat to Energy Efficient Residences (HBEER) initiative in an established residential area near downtown Monticello, Kentucky. The HBEER initiative has created green jobs and is bringing back 575 skilled workers and 1,000 related jobs that were lost in the houseboat manufacturing and marine industries due to the economy. HBEER is a partnership between the UK College of Design, the Center for Applied Energy Research at UK, the Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation (KHIC) and the Kentucky Housing Corporation (KHC). HBEER has received financing from the U.S. Department of Energy through the Kentucky Department of Local Government and the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Appalachian Regional Commission, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the U.S. Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration, Rural Local Initiatives Support Corporation and UK. USDA Rural Development has worked with KHIC throughout the project, awarding the company a Rural Business Enterprise Grant which was used to establish a revolving loan fund. That fund was used to supply some of the working capital used by Stardust to build the prototype. KHIC also is working with Rural Development’s Single Family Housing Program to assist potential homeowners obtain financing for HBEER properties. The completed prototype sits on a city lot. The firm is also considering building multi-family units and portable school classrooms. The multi-year project was initiated in the fall of and directly responds to the impact the current economic downturn has had on the houseboat manufacturing industry in Kentucky. More than 50 students and faculty at the college’s School of Architecture were responsible for researching and developing initial models of energy-efficient, affordable housing that could be produced by the region’s houseboat manufacturers. Highlights of the HBEER project include: Estimated energy costs at current rates are expected to be about $1.65 per day, which is one-half to one-sixth of energy bills for other housing alternatives. More than 80 percent of the home value is derived from products made in Kentucky and Kentucky labor, which further increases the jobs created or saved. When the partnership began in , Stardust Cruisers had 12 full-time employees and 12 contract workers. It now has 56 full-time employees, including six who are dedicated to the HBEER project. As a result of this project, Stardust also has improved the energy efficiency of its houseboats and is one of the few houseboat manufacturers exporting new products. The completed prototype sits on a city lot. The firm is also considering building multi-family units and portable school classrooms. The next phase of the HBEER project will include a prototype for multifamily housing as well as classroom space for schools that will serve as an energy efficient and more durable alternative to portable classrooms.

Photo courtesy of G20 host Saudi Arabia As the new decade unfolds, a remarkable trend is evident in the world. In , the global community and the media have been focused on the surge of a novel virus, the spread of African swine fever, wildfires, outbreak of desert locust, and debates on the safe use of agricultural technology. These challenges have similar characteristics – they span borders, have significant economic outcomes, and require global scientific collaboration to effectively address them. Public policy makers look to researchers to advance critical knowledge and offer solutions, and this research requires international collaboration. For success, however, efforts must be grounded in foundational principles and values that support international science. Core research values include openness, transparency, reciprocity, and merit-based competition. Openness and transparency are critical because they support reproducibility of results, promote accurate interpretation of findings, and help ensure appropriate disclosure of conflicts of commitment or interest (which is vital for fairly awarding research investments). Reciprocity ensures all parties mutually benefit from contributing to the research, meaning the contribution of each party needs to be proportionally aligned with what they receive, as perceived by each collaborator. Merit-based competition provides support to the best ideas. Together, these values provide the pillars for engagement. Yet, in a dynamic global research landscape with changing actors, shifting influence, and novel ways of working, we can’t take these values for granted. Foundational values need to be actively supported and promoted by all sectors, including agriculture. In February, USDA had the opportunity to promote these core research values during the G20 Meeting of the Agricultural Chief Scientists (G20 MACS) in Saudi Arabia. USDA’s delegation, led by the Office of the Chief Scientist and the Mission Area for Research, Education, and Economics, worked with counterparts to capture the roles of openness, transparency, and reciprocity in the G20 MACS communique. The values were also discussed in the plenary and during informal engagement. In addition to the G20 MACS, USDA looks forward to advancing the conversation on core research values and principles through our strong network of international collaborations.

He has turned his Charlane Plantation into a textbook tree farm. Photo credit: Photo provided courtesy of Chuck Leavell Chuck Leavell may be known as the legendary keyboardist for the Rolling Stones and the Allman Brothers Band, but he’s just as proud of being a champion for tree stewardship and sustainable forest management.   His conservation ethic, his forest advocacy and his personal stewardship of Charlane Plantation near Macon, Ga., were recognized Feb. 27 when the U.S. Forest Service proclaimed him an honorary forest ranger. “This means every bit as much to me as that Grammy did a couple of weeks ago,” said Leavell. During a ceremony at the Georgian Terrace Hotel in Atlanta, Leavell accepted the award in the presence of dozens of uniformed past and present forest rangers. “Trees and forests are the lifeblood of our country. They give us so much,” Leavell said. “We have many challenges to keep our American forests healthy … and yet the forests have proven to be exceptionally resilient, it’s up to us to keep it that way.” Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell bestowed the honor. “We are grateful to Chuck for using his platform as a world-famous musician to help spread the word about the importance of sustainable forest management,” Tidwell said. “When Chuck talks, people listen.” Leavell and his wife, Rose Lane, have studied conservation techniques here and abroad, constantly finding ways to improve their wildlife and forest management. At home, their forestry practices have turned Charlane Plantation into a textbook tree farm, earning accolades from the Georgia Conservancy, the National Arbor Day Foundation and the American Tree Farm System.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Apr 11,  Last month, I spent three days in Michigan and while spring weather in the Great Lakes State doesn’t appeal to some, I was excited to make the trip. After all, when I was a student at the University of Michigan (Go Blue!), I volunteered at Food Gatherers. So, when asked to speak at their “The State of Our Plate” convening, I said, “Yes!” Some of the people in the room, who were classmates, continuously help federal nutrition programs operate successfully in Washtenaw County through their work to improve food access. I am deeply appreciative for their unwavering service and for showing up for families in need. Another set of Michiganders that I’m fiercely proud of are the school food service professionals. I joined the Oakland County child nutrition professionals at their 42nd annual workshop: Get Your Groove On for Child Nutrition. Day after day, they are feeding our future and giving kids a healthy start. After meeting with 15 Oakland County food service directors, I learned more about their local initiatives and their thoughts on the child nutrition proposed rules. I heard about Oakland County’s Better with Breakfast program, a groundbreaking public/non-profit collaboration between the Oakland County Board of Commissioners, Oakland Schools, and the United Way for Southeastern Michigan. Following the meeting, I also visited Waterford Kettering High School’s early lunch service, talked with students, and met with school administrators who couldn’t agree more that hungry children don’t learn well. But it is not just kids who need proper nutrition to thrive, nutrition security for all is critically important which is why USDA was thankful to be a part of the summit hosted by ProMedica and The Root Cause Coalition at Trinity Health Ann Arbor. Healthcare professionals, insurers, federal, state, and local government officials, and many others came together to discuss hunger as a public health issue. Hunger and diet-related diseases are almost entirely preventable and while USDA administers some of the most effective tools to help address these problems, USDA can’t fight this battle alone. One amazing model that provides access to healthy foods and bridges nutrition security and healthcare is The Farm at Trinity Health which I toured following the summit. Watch for an upcoming blog about The Farm and how it is growing a healthy community. Incredible! I left Michigan truly inspired by who I met and what I heard, and excited for the work we will do together in the days ahead.

"USDA Agricultural Marketing Service & Alan Shannon, USDA Food and Nutrition Service Midwest Region in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Farming  Nov 03,  Savory chicken, sweet and spicy baked beans, and glazed carrots were part of the new recipe served to students in Chicago schools. One of USDA’s most important missions is providing healthy meals to school lunch programs across the country.  In a unique partnership, the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) agencies teamed up with Rachael Ray’s Yum-o! non-profit organization, the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) system and Chartwells-Thompson Hospitality to create and serve a new healthy, tasty and exciting school lunch recipe. To do this, Bob Bloomer of Chartwells-Thompson, the provider of meals in most of Chicago’s schools, worked with the Agricultural Marketing Service to acquire fresh, unprocessed chicken. After issuing a solicitation and competitive bids from domestic suppliers, the Agricultural Marketing Service awarded the first contract for two truckloads—that’s 80,000 pounds —of raw chicken leg quarters for shipment to Chicago’s schools. Next the Midwest Food and Nutrition Staff worked with Rachael Ray ’s Yum-o! non-profit to create a healthy, tasty meal. “I had so much fun creating this recipe with Chicago Public Schools,” said Ray. “I tried to create a recipe that would capture the cultural diversity of Chicago and most importantly, that the kids would love to eat.” The result: Windy City Chicken -- a savory meal of chicken, sweet and spicy baked beans, brown rice and orange-glazed carrots. Prepared by food service staff, the new menu itesm were served to thrilled Second City students in more than 450 schools as part of National School Lunch Week on October 13th.  NBC-Chicago, which covered the event, captured the reaction of a number of children who raved about the meal. “It tastes like heaven,” said one student. Students enjoyed the new lunch menu items made possible by a unique collaboration USDA agencies, a celebrity chef, and the Chicago Schools system. October was National Farm to School Month, which promotes locally-sourced foods in school meal programs, so the menu also featured locally grown food. Chicago Public Schools, through its primary food provider, Chartwells-Thompson, has the largest farm to school program in the Midwest, with more than $2.5 million in fruits and vegetables purchased from regional growers and producers. The carrots used for the special menu are one of the items in CPS’s well-known frozen local program. They were grown within 250 miles of the city, picked at their peak ripeness and flash frozen to preserve their fresh-tasting flavor—and nutrients. The special menu entrée will be served again in the future. In fact, the Agricultural Marketing Service has already awarded additional contracts for more of the chicken.

The bipartisan Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of mandated that the USDA set for what needed to be included in local school wellness policies in areas such as setting goals for nutrition education and physical activity, informing parents about content of the policy and implementation, and periodically assessing progress and sharing updates as appropriate. As part of local school wellness policies, the proposed would ensure that foods and beverages marketed to children in schools are consistent with the recently-released Smart Snacks in School standards. Ensuring that unhealthy food is not marketed to children is one of the First Lady's top priorities; that is why it is so important for schools to reinforce the importance of healthy choices and eliminate marketing of unhealthy products.""The idea here is simple—our classrooms should be healthy places where kids aren't bombarded with ads for junk food,"" said First Lady Michelle Obama. ""Because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home, their work shouldn't be undone by unhealthy messages at school.""This action comes after the White House Summit on Food Marketing to Children last fall where Mrs. Obama called on the country to ensure children's health was not undermined by marketing of unhealthy food.""The food marketing and local wellness standards proposed today support better health for our kids and echo the good work already taking place at home and in schools across the country. The new standards ensure that schools remain a safe place where kids can learn and where the school environment promotes healthy choices. USDA is committed to working closely with students, parents, school stakeholders and the food and beverage industries to implement the new and make the healthy choice, the easy choice for America's young people,"" Secretary Vilsack said.To help schools with the implementation of the school wellness policies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has launched a new ""School Nutrition Environment and Wellness Resources"" website, which includes sample wellness policy language for school districts and a dedicated page of resources for food marketing practices on the school campus.These new resources will complement a second announcement which highlights the nationwide expansion of a successful program that was piloted in 11 states with the goal of ensuring children who are in need of nutritious meals are receiving them. Beginning July 1, , more than 22,000 schools across the country—which serve primarily low-income students—will be eligible to serve healthy free lunches and breakfasts to all students. This will help as many as 9 million American children eat healthy meals at school, especially breakfast, which can have profound impacts on educational achievement. Research shows that kids who eat breakfast in the classroom preform over 17% better on math tests and have fewer disciplinary problems.For more information, go to is an equal opportunity provider and employer.

"What is the Nine Agency Rule? The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) enforces the Nine Agency Rule under the authority delegated by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. § 2.25 (a). The Nine Agency Rule is designed to ensure that USDA programs of civil rights, including program delivery, compliance, and equal employment opportunity, adhere to all governing laws, rules, and regulations, including related Executive Orders and Congressional mandates. On February 14, , President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed Executive Order 5, establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, emphasizing the importance of partnering with civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations, to serve people in need while adhering to all governing laws. This Executive Order revoked Executive Order 1 and reinstated key provisions to protect religious liberty. Key Provisions of the Nine Agency Rule  Equal Access for Faith-Based Organizations  Under 7 CFR § 16, faith-based organizations are eligible to access and participate in USDA assistance programs on the same basis as any other organization. USDA and its intermediaries must not discriminate against or for an organization based on its religious character, motives, affiliation, or lack thereof.  Non-Discrimination Against Beneficiaries  Organizations receiving direct or indirect Federal financial assistance from USDA must not discriminate against current or prospective beneficiaries based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.  Separation of Religious Activities  Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance must separate any explicitly religious activities in time or location from the programs or services funded by USDA direct assistance, ensuring participation in such activities is voluntary. This restriction does not apply to indirect Federal financial assistance.

"USDA Rural Development-South Dakota in  Initiatives  Rural  Aug 30,  Community leaders from the Town of Ipswich, South Dakota celebrate the construction of a new water tower.  USDA Rural Development joined Ipswich, South Dakota city officials, congressional staff, partners, and members of the community recently for a “raising of the ball” event.    There was excitement in the air as the National Anthem was sung by members of the Ipswich High School chorus, drum roll, and all eyes focused on the crane raising the “ball” to complete the 150,000 gallon elevated tower.    This was definitely a site to see as history was in the making in this small rural town – population 943.  The original system, including the tower and lines were constructed back in – 100 years ago. Thanks to the assistance provided through the American Recovery Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) Funding through a USDA Rural Development Water and Waste Direct Loan in the amount of $1,635,000 and a Grant of $1,593,000 to the City of Ipswich, improvements are being made to its water system.  Federal funds were leveraged with a Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) of $500,000 and other state funding totaling $1,300,000.  The City of Ipswich purchases all of its water from WEB Water Development and the quality is excellent.  USDA Rural Development financing was necessary to assist with keeping the rates from becoming high for the residents.  The present water system has not had significant upgrades and this project will reduce line breakages and water losses where the old cast iron lines are still being used.  The new elevated water tank will greatly improve water pressure and fire flows throughout the town.  Water meters will be replaced and residents will soon be receiving a monthly bill verses the self-reading method currently being used.  “This project will allow Ipswich to have a water system which is second to none without adding high water rates for the city’s residents,” said David Penfield, Mayor of the City of Ipswich.  “The loans and grants make it possible for Ipswich to continuing improving its infrastructure.  We are a small community with all the benefits and amenities of a large community.  Our goal is to advance into the future in a progressive manner for the benefit of all residents.” A crane lifts the ball into place in Ipswich.

"Administrator of USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) in  Equity  Initiatives  Mar 11,  It’s Women’s History Month and I am proud to work alongside so many great women leaders at USDA. When I was asked last year to lead the Risk Management Agency it came as a surprise. Living far from the Washington Beltway in South Dakota, in a rural area, I could not imagine why this administration would want me to head an agency of such importance. I am not a well-known political leader or influencer. However, this administration made a commitment to embrace diversity. They decided in the best interest of this Nation to seek out qualified women for important roles. And choosing me did come down to some important qualifications, including 40 years of operating a farm, serving as a county executive for the Farm Service Agency, working in the private sector, and my belief that Federal crop insurance is invaluable to the success of any ag operation. This administration’s decision to choose me is a testament not to me, but to this administration's commitment to ALL women. They recognize the value of women in agriculture and what women continue to do throughout time - their day-to-day work, supporting partners, and their desires to make things better for their families, which is why this month - Women's History Month - is so important to me. Sometime this month, please find a moment to reflect on the contributions and sacrifices of women to society and in our personal lives. Marcia Bunger is the Administrator of USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA). Prior to her appointment, she served as a County Executive Director for USDA’s Farm Service Agency.

"Counselor for Agricultural Affairs-Vietnam, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Nov 18,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (right) speaking at Hanoi University of Agriculture, Hanoi, Vietnam on Wednesday, November 16, . There are many things that Americans are known for, including dreaming big, working hard to turn those dreams into a reality, and reaching out to help others who are also trying to make their dreams come true. During his trip to Hanoi, Vietnam, earlier this week, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack—whose own personal story and history of public service epitomizes these very characteristics—challenged a packed auditorium of more than 600 students and faculty at the Hanoi University of Agriculture (HUA) to be the generation whose dreams transform their communities, their country and their world. HUA, Vietnam’s oldest and largest agricultural university, was the perfect setting for this message, as many of its alumni have been instrumental in helping Vietnam transform in just 25 years from a food aid recipient to one of the world’s top agricultural producers and exporters. In fact, Vietnam is one of the world’s fastest growing economies and an important market for U.S. agricultural products. In the past decade, Vietnam jumped from the fiftieth to fifteenth position as a market for U.S. farm exports. At the same time, the United States has become a growing market for Vietnamese goods such as rice, coffee, cashew, spices and seafood. Two-way trade between the United States and Vietnam is strong for each partner. Although Vietnam no longer faces the problem of chronic food shortages, Secretary Vilsack reminded the students that new threats to the country’s food supply—whether from the impact of climate change to the decimation of crops and livestock through disease—needed to be anticipated, countered and controlled. “What is the best way to do that?” asked the Secretary. Embrace science—just like Dr. Norman Borlaug. When Secretary Vilsack told the capacity crowd about Dr. Borlaug’s green revolution, the estimated 1 billion lives he saved, and the World Food Prize he established, you could almost feel the dreams taking flight from the eager students. Secretary Vilsack closed his remarks by challenging the audience to aspire to make a difference, not by dreaming of things as they are, but as they should be. I know that somewhere in that auditorium, someone is going to do just that. Note: Vilsack is visiting with Asian Pacific partners in Vietnam and China to help strengthen trade relations and support the American brand throughout the region.

The crisp fall air provides an invigorating environment for outdoor activity.  What better time to visit and volunteer on our national forests and grasslands than on Sept. 28, for the 20th annual National Public Lands Day and second annual National Tribal Lands Day. This is the nation's largest, single-day volunteer effort for public lands sponsored by the National Environmental Education Foundation. This year’s theme is: “Helping Hands for America’s Lands.” National Public Lands Day is one of six fee-free days in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, National Get Outdoors Day, and Veterans Day Weekend. Fees are waived generally for day use, such as picnic areas, developed trailheads and destination visitor centers. Fees are not waived for concessionaire-operated facilities or for overnight use such as camping or recreation rentals. “America’s national forests and grasslands belong to all of us,” said U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell. “These beautiful places have so much to offer, and we hope you’ll get outside and volunteer on National Public Lands Day to enjoy these places for yourself, while improving them for future visitors.” NPLD events include diverse activities such as planting trees, learning about bats, cleaning up rivers, and much more.  Participants can contact their nearest forest or grassland for event information or visit the National Public Lands Day web site. This year, many Forest Service sites will offer educational activities focusing on wildfire prevention. National Tribal Lands Day will also take place on Sept. 28 and celebrate healthy lands, people and tribal culture. Activities will encourage volunteerism, outdoor recreation and environmental education on land that is owned and managed by sovereign tribal governments. In , about 175,000 volunteers served at 2,206 National Public Lands Day sites in every state, the District of Columbia and U.S. territories, making it the largest participation in the event’s history. They collected an estimated 500 tons of trash and 23,000 pounds of invasive plants, planted 100,000 trees and other plants and built or maintained 1,500 miles of trails. Forest Service lands, which include 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands, offer something for everyone, from the casual hiker to the thrill-seeking recreationist.

"APHIS Public Affairs Specialist in  Animals  Plants  May 22,  Photo credit: Mark Trail via @ComicsKingdom Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) Awareness week is May 17-23 and my tenure in a nationally syndicated comic strip is coming to an end, so it’s a good time to tell you how a new USDA employee wound up cartoon-ized. The Mark Trail strip—known for its environmental themes—just finished a six-week long storyline about the invasive EAB.  The EAB, a small metallic green wood-boring beetle, destroys ash trees and is now found in 25 U.S. States.  The Mark Trail strip features “Agent Abbey Powell from the USDA” and shares information about the EAB. To view the comic—beginning with my debut—visit Mark Trail. How did this happen? James Allen, the strip’s current author, called the APHIS Public Affairs Office with his interest in developing the storyline. I took Allen’s call and answered his questions—not suspecting at the time that I would end up in the comic!  He was curious about the EAB, which likely arrived in the US in the late ’s or early s, in solid wood packing material.  In response, APHIS now requires that imported wood packing material be treated to kill any invasive pests that may be hitchhiking inside.  I provided an outline of how the USDA would respond if Mark Trail contacted us about the EAB, and developed a scenario to fit into his planned storyline. I told Allen about the sticky purple traps APHIS uses to survey for EAB and the stingless wasps we release as a biological control. “Abbey got right on the task and sent over a treasure trove of info and pictures. Details of everything... step by step procedures of their approach to identifying the insect, quarantine of the area and biocontrol practices. Abbey was so helpful, I asked her permission to put her in the strip as an agent of the USDA,” said Allen. “She kindly obliged and sent a picture of herself. I referenced from her photo and made her a ""Mark Trail-ized"" character,” he added. While I provided key messages, it was Allen who crafted the story and art for each installment. He took some scientific and other liberties—ranging from my job title (“Agent Powell” instead of public affairs specialist) to technical points concerning the biology and behavior of EAB, and the story’s ending. Allen and I have both been flattered by the response. He said, “As I continued writing the story, her part began to grow. It seems the public's interest grew as well. Readers at the Comics Kingdom website were posting things like ‘I searched Abbey Powell... there is one that actually works at the USDA!’ ... and ‘I found her LinkedIn profile and she looks like the character in the strip!’” I’m humbled and honored to be part of this comic strip with national reach to help raise public awareness about EAB and other invasive pests and diseases and what APHIS does to combat these threats.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Transportation and Marketing in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Dec 15,  A winter market in Rochester, NY. There are more than 1,200 operating winter farmers markets across the nation. You can find a market near you by using the USDA National Farmers Market Directory. Traditionally, the onset of winter meant the end of farmers market season. However, in recent years, winter farmers markets have become increasingly popular. According to the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), there are over 1,200 of these farmers markets operating across the country. This is almost a 38 percent increase from last year. From to , the number of winter markets in New York, the top state for these markets, increased from 152 to 180. The state has been the recipient of several grants to support and promote access to healthy foods. For example, New York’s Oneida County received grant funds to develop a year-round market in downtown Utica. For consumers, winter farmers markets provide an opportunity to enjoy winter crops like squash and pears, fresh from their local farmers. For the farmers and vendors who sell at the markets, it means increased financial opportunities. “Our sales at the winter market even out our income over the year, eliminating some of the highs and lows of our financial situation,” said Skip Paul, a farmer at Wishing Stone Farm in Little Compton, Rhode Island. In addition to increasing financial opportunities, winter markets allow farmers and vendors to solidify their relationships with customers. An extended season enables market customers to get to know their local farmers better. “The biggest impact for us is really doing local networking and selling,” said Rhode Island farmer Lauri Roberts. “Selling directly to customers really means a lot to us.” It also means a lot to us, here at USDA, that local producers can provide consumers with this direct buying experience, while at the same time, offering them fresh, healthy, locally-grown foods.  We even hold our own winter farmers market, which features local products such as fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, eggs, honey, herbs, handmade soaps, baked goods and more.  In addition, through USDA grants, such as those offered by the Farmers Market Promotion Program and Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, many of the nation’s winter farmers markets can look to us for support in their marketing initiatives.

"Information Officer, Office of the Chief Economist in  Energy  Sep 21,  USDA Report highlights Increased Energy Efficiency for Corn-based Ethanol Harry Baumes, Acting Director of USDA’s Office of Energy Policy and New Uses, says a report that surveyed corn growers in and ethanol plants in indicates the net energy gain from converting corn to ethanol is improving in efficiency.  Titled “ Energy Balance for the Corn-Ethanol Industry,” the report surveyed ethanol producers about ethanol yield (undenatured) per bushel of corn and energy used in ethanol plants. This report measured all conventional fossil fuel energy, 53,785 BTU used in the production of 1 gallon of corn ethanol. For every British Thermal Unit (BTU)  (unit of heat equal to the amount of heat to raise one pound of water one degree  Fahrenheit at one atmosphere) of energy to make ethanol, 2.3 BTUs of energy are produced (energy output/energy input). The ratio is somewhat higher for some firms that are partially substituting biomass energy in processing energy (thermal and electrical energy in the plant to convert corn to one gallon of ethanol). Since the last study in , the net energy balance of corn ethanol has increased from 1.76 BTUs to 2.3 BTUs of energy. According to the report, overall, ethanol has made the transition from an energy sink (more energy used than energy produced), to a moderate net energy gain in the s, to a substantial net energy gain in the present. And there are still prospects for improvement. Ethanol yields have increased by about 10 percent in the last 20 years, so proportionately less corn is . In addition to refinements in ethanol technology, corn yields have increased by 39 percent over the last 20 years, requiring less land to produce ethanol.  The report can be found here.

I feel like in this space, I’ve been proud of who I am.” So remarked Celeste Lucero, a USDA Tribal Policy Intern working with USDA Rural Development’s Tribal Relations team this summer. Lucero is one of 14 undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students participating in this historic new program that aims to develop a new generation of agricultural professionals with a better understanding of Tribal food and agriculture issues. Through the Future Leaders in Public Service Internship Program, students are working on USDA agriculture, food, and nutrition programs that benefit Indian Country. The program is sponsored by USDA’s Office of Tribal Relations. This spring, Lucero graduated from the University of New Mexico with degrees in environmental science and economics. She will continue her studies with a master’s in economics. She is a member of the Pueblo of Isleta in New Mexico, as well as Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians in North Dakota. Before she even started her 10-week internship at Rural Development, “my boss [Tedd Buelow] and the team asked “what do you want to get out of this internship?” With her team’s guidance, Lucero is writing a white paper for the Water and Environmental Program on water rights and accessibility for the Miccosukee Tribe near Miami, Florida. Lucero’s Pueblo of Isleta affiliation gives her a unique perspective on her project. “The protection of our rights and recognition of our sovereignty can be traced back to Queen Isabella I of Castile’s will of 1504. Our sovereignty was protected throughout the Spanish reign through laws within the Recopilación de Indias. When New Mexico became part of the United States, our rights [including water rights] were preserved. Our rights are much different than other Tribes.” she remarked. A big takeaway from this summer is the importance of representation. “Diversity in these fields is important,” she stated. “For example, I’ve taken some [Tribal] trainings, and suggested to my teammates that they could be improved with more regional Tribal information.” Learning about the breadth of USDA resources was also an eye opener. “I’ve also learned how Tribes like mine are able to get USDA funding for projects, Lucero noted. There is a whole new world of resources that hopefully I'll be able to bring that back to my own people.” Lucero’s advice for other interns? “Find your community, whether in or outside of the workplace. And get to know your colleagues and supervisor. They know these policies and programs front to back. USDA has a lot to offer.” Learn more about USDA internship programs at www.usda.gov/youth/career.

"Illinois Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  May 22,  The wetland in bloom with a more than 100-year-old oak tree standing prominently in the prairie. Natural Land Institute photo. Now, when you look at the Nygren Wetland Preserve in Illinois, a menagerie of wildlife can be seen –  ducks and geese paddling about, white pelicans lounging, otters swimming and a pair of sandhill cranes huddling in a nest. There was talk of the endangered blanding turtles living in the wetland, too. It’s a wonderful scene, but it was much different 14 years ago. The land, located along Raccoon Creek at the confluence of the Rock and Pecatonica rivers, was once forests and crops. The Natural Land Institute purchased the land in , and that’s when transformation began. The institute works to create an enduring legacy of natural land in northern Illinois for people, plants and animals. The wetland was made possible by the institute’s partnership with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, along with a trust given to the institute by the Nygren family. NRCS provided $1 million toward the purchase of the 655-acre easement from the land’s original owner. Flooded cropland that eventually became Nygren Wetland Preserve. Natural Land Institute photo. The land was enrolled in the former Wetlands Reserve Program, which provides financial assistance for restoring wetlands. The Farm Bill replaced that program with the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program, which has similar goals. “NRCS assistance and countless other partners have helped with developing this property into what it is today and for the general public to enjoy on a daily basis,” said Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist in Winnebago County, Ill. “I think we all should feel good about that.” The Nygren Wetland Preserve includes six types of plant communities, including wetlands, prairie and woodlands. Each requires specific management and maintenance that include re-seeding and prescribed burns. The burns reduce the unwanted plants and stimulate the native grasses. “It has been great working with the entire NLI staff at the Nygren WRP site,” Franks said. “They truly are great conservation stewards and protect the valuable natural resources in northern Illinois.” An extensive flood in caused reed canary grass to take over a portion of the wetland. Reed canary grass is an invasive species that will overtake native plants if not controlled. Kevin Rohling talks about the plants in the wetland with Josh Franks, NRCS district conservationist, and Ellen Starr, NRCS area biologist. NRCS photo. “We have an ongoing attempt to eradicate the invasive grass,” said Kevin Rohling, the institute’s stewardship director. The institute also has a reed canary grass experiment plot. “We are attempting to see if we can eradicate the grass without using herbicides,” Rohling said, saying they clip seed heads before seeds are naturally dispersed by the plant. The institute intends to restore the wetland with original grasses and forbs. “Seeds are collected on site, and if not available, we reach out to surrounding areas for those hard to find seeds,” Rohling said. Years ago, Raccoon Creek was straightened to improve farming activities. When deciding how to return the stream to its meandering state, it was discovered the old stream channel was still intact.  Dikes were placed to force the water back to the original channel. Three years later, a study on the meandering creek showed there was a 100 percent increase in fish species and 1,000 percent increase in fish abundance. Partnerships and volunteers have made this wetland what it is today and the volunteers are the heart of the preserve. The Nygren Wetland Preserve not only has tremendous volunteer support but is also located next to three forest preserves. The contiguous preserves provide a large nesting, breeding and flyway for birds, amphibians and mammals, not to mention the enjoyment and educational opportunities for local residents. As beautiful as it is today, the Nygren Wetland Preserve maintenance and support is ongoing. “We are currently assisting them with a restoration contract approved last year to manage 36 acres of reed canary grass and 156 acres of prescribed burning in and ,” Franks said. “They are always excited to try new things at the property and I anticipate us assisting when we are able to in the future.” White pelicans enjoy a rest before moving on to more northern nesting grounds.

(Photo courtesy of The National Science Foundation, Durelle Scott) Day after day we’re seeing more impacts from climate change, and many concerned folks want to know what exactly their government is doing about it. In other words, who’s keeping score on what we’re doing as our climate warms? With this in mind, the U.S. Forest Service has developed something it calls the Climate Change Performance Scorecard. The scorecard was created as a way for the Forest Service to measure how well it was responding to climate change and to keep track of experiences and best practices so others could learn from them. “Given our role in managing our country’s natural resources, we have a particularly unique opportunity to respond,” said Dave Cleaves, U.S. Forest Service Climate Change Advisor. “The Scorecard is helping more forest land managers develop an understanding of how climate change will impact rivers, tree health, wildfire activity, and more … and what to do about it.” And, importantly, the Scorecard helps implement the Forest Service’s National Roadmap for Responding to Climate Change. “The Roadmap is our strategic guidance for pulling climate change into the Forest Service’s daily operations, and the Scorecard helps implement this guidance by focusing national forests’ efforts and tracking success,” said Cleaves. This is because the Scorecard is organized around areas like integrating climate change into employee education, program management, and partnerships. The Scorecard also encourages national forest land managers to better understand which of their natural resources are most vulnerable to climate change, how forests can operate more sustainably, and more. Since the Roadmap and Scorecard were released in , the Forest Service has accomplished impressive results. The majority of the Scorecard is now being successfully achieved by our national forest land managers. But this is just the beginning. National forest land managers are expected to continue to push, to achieve even greater successes around climate change issues in the near future.

"Administrator, USDA Rural Development Rural Utilities Service in  Initiatives  Rural  Jan 18,   This fall USDA’s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) successfully completed its final round of grant awards under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act).  In the last year and a half, we’ve done more to bridge the digital divide for rural Americans than many ever thought possible.  The Recovery Act has unleashed an historic level of investment in rural high speed telecommunications infrastructure that will create new jobs, new services and new opportunities across the countryside. The Recovery Act Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) consisted of two rounds of funding.  In those two rounds the RUS broadband team reviewed more than 3,000 applications and selected 320 projects for awards across 46 states and one territory.  This amazing accomplishment will help transform rural communities and lead to new economic opportunities that we can only begin to imagine. I’m pleased to announce that we have just published an 84-page report, entitled “Advancing Broadband,” that details all the projects that won BIP awards.  The selection process was rigorous and the competition was intense.  The Advancing Broadband report explains the exciting new services which will soon be made available in hundreds of rural communities.   Let me give you a quick overview of the report. By leveraging the original $2.5 billion authorized by Congress to fund loans as well as grants, USDA was able to invest almost $3.53 billion in rural broadband infrastructure.  In addition, $285 million of non-federal funds were committed to be invested in BIP projects.  This funding will enable around 7 million rural Americans to connect to one of 285 last-mile, 12 middle-mile, or four satellite projects funded by the BIP program.  On top of that, over 360,000 businesses and 30,000 community service organizations such as hospitals, schools and public safety agencies will be connected to a high-speed digital future. Broadband access is one of the pillars of rural economic development identified by Secretary Vilsack and President Obama.  “Advancing Broadband” provides a foundation for strong rural communities.  Products, services and ideas originated in rural communities can find a global market.  Life-long learning, government services and quality medical advice can be brought right into your community and home.  Jobs and economic opportunity will be created as successful applicants build out BIP funded systems and as rural farms, businesses and communities find new ways to build on this exciting new infrastructure.  Approximately 25,000 jobs will be created immediately and many thousands more will be created in the future based on these new networks. Bill and Shelley Nondorf of Hoxie, KS, are great examples of the potential to build out and build on broadband.  Thanks to new services deployed by a BIP award recipient, Bill and Shelley have been able to grow their business and provide more services to customers. I am very proud of the work of the RUS team to successfully complete record breaking investments in telecommunications, electric and water infrastructure.  Our work is far from done.  Our field staff, accountants and agency experts will be working to ensure that taxpayer dollars are well spent and projects are kept on track.  Another BIP funded initiative provided nineteen technical assistance grants to encourage regional economic development planning based on expanding broadband access.  Soon, we will be opening our regular broadband loan and grant programs to new applications.  We are encouraging those who did not get funded in the highly competitive BIP program to consider applying to our broadband loan and community connect programs.  I hope you’ll take a close look at this report.  To see it, click here.

"Economic Research Service in  Research and Science  Sep 12,  Manufacturing employment declines were the highest in the Eastern U.S. between and . Compared to urban areas, in , manufacturing represented a greater share of both private nonfarm rural jobs and rural earnings . A new report from USDA’s Economic Research Service, Rural Manufacturing at a Glance, examines the manufacturing sector in rural America. Manufacturing jobs in rural areas totaled about 2.5 million jobs in and pay relatively well; among all rural sectors, only mining had higher median earnings. The manufacturing sector’s share of employment and earnings in rural areas began to exceed its share in urban areas in the s, when import competition forced domestic manufacturers to lower costs. Rural areas generally have lower wages, property taxes, and land prices, making these areas relatively attractive to manufacturing firms. Overall, manufacturing is no longer the driver of job growth that it once was. Between and , a period that included two recessions (in and -09), manufacturing employment fell close to 30 percent. In addition, 71 percent of U.S. counties experienced a decline in manufacturing employment. Counties with the largest relative declines were concentrated in the eastern United States, the traditional hub of U.S. manufacturing. Despite the relative importance of manufacturing to the rural economy, economic restructuring is altering job opportunities for rural areas of the country. Rural manufacturing employment was smaller both in relative and absolute terms in than in . There were 21 percent fewer manufacturing jobs while total employment grew almost 7 percent. That is, manufacturing employment became a smaller piece of a larger pie. When a manufacturing plant closes in a community, there is a reduction in local employment, earnings, and government tax revenue. To better understand factors affecting manufacturing plant survival, another ERS study, released in May, followed the plants from until the end of , if they survived that long. It found that rural plants have a higher survival rate than urban plants. All else being equal, plants in urban counties were 23 percent less likely to survive than plants in rural counties.  Survival rates were significantly lower for textile and apparel manufacturing industries than other industries. In rural America, textile and apparel manufacturing plants had a 26-percent survival rate between and . During the same period, rural plants as a whole had a 57-percent survival rate. Trade-related policy changes and automation were two of the reasons for textiles and apparel manufacturing declines during the study period. Manufacturing is relatively more important to the rural economy than the urban economy.

"NRCS Helps to Keep Native American Traditions Alive  The 567 federally-recognized Native American Tribes are unique in their own way—from their languages and family structure, to their clothing and food. Tribes are working hard to revive their roots to help reconnect their heritage to the land, rekindle their spiritual bonds and cultural traditions, and raise awareness amongst future generations; especially tribal youth in line to inherit the land. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with the tribes like the Choctaw Indians, comprised of nearly 10,ates, to farm and harvest hickory king corn and other heirloom white varieties, and process them to make hominy. Hominy is made from dried corn kernels, but it is expensive to purchase. NRCS provides the tribe with technical assistance to help transform idle land into a hominy-making enterprise–enabling the tribe to provide their own locally-grown, fresh produce, and cut their expenses by growing the corn.

"Passionate Couple, USDA, Team up for 'Miracle:' Bringing Back the American Chestnut  It was on a hilltop in eastern Kentucky where I first met James and Gail Cope, looking at the 27 newly planted American chestnut seedlings on their land. It was our common love for this rare tree that brought us together. American chestnut trees once dominated the Appalachian landscape, but during the early s a fungus struck the trees causing them nearly to vanish. The American Chestnut Blight, an Asian fungus, first struck in in New York City and quickly spread, leaving in its wake a trail of dead and dying stems.  By the s, the keystone species of some nine million acres of forests had disappeared. The tree is important because it produces bushels of nuts for wildlife, and animals like squirrels, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, black bear, and grouse depend on the nuts for a major food source.

"Needing a Clearer Crystal Ball  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  If you think the local weather forecaster has trouble predicting if it will rain tomorrow, imagine how hard it is to forecast crop production world-wide. If there is too little rain in Brazil in August, it could delay planting of the country’s summer maize crop and subsequently diminish that harvest. If the decrease is big enough, it could possibly have implications for international commodity prices and might even impact global food security. This in turn can translate into the need for policy makers to respond to economic and trade issues and problems in countries where food insecurity is a persistent threat.

"Changing Climate Is Affecting Agriculture in the U.S. The changing climate presents real threats to U.S. agricultural production, forest resources, and rural economies. These threats have significant implications not just for farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners, but for all Americans. Land managers across the country are already feeling the pressures of a changing climate and its effects on weather. As these risks continue and amplify, producers will be faced with the challenges of adapting. Some of these risks are:  More severe storms - NOAA reported that was the second most intense year in our history for extreme weather events.  Rising average temperatures - Higher temperatures mean increases in invasive species and costs for weed and pest control.  Extremes in precipitation - In the Northeast, heavier, more intense rains threaten to reduce yields. In the Southwest, increased drought poses a challenge to nut, fruit and vegetable producers.  More forest fires - The fire season is 60 days longer than it was 30 years ago. A recent Forest Service study predicts that the number of acres susceptible to fires could double by . Preparing for Increased Weather Risks Regional Climate Hubs In an effort to mitigate climate-related risks, USDA has established seven regional hubs for risk adaptation and mitigation to climate change. These Hubs will deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to farmers, ranchers and forest landowners on a regional basis to support decision-making related to changing climate. The Hubs will provide:  Technical support for land managers to respond to drought, heat stress, floods, pests, and changes in the growing season.  Assessments and regional forecasts for hazard and adaptation planning to provide more time to prepare.  Outreach and education for farmers, ranchers and forest landowners on ways to mitigate risks and thrive despite change. For more information on the Hubs, visit the USDA Climate Hubs Webpage. Climate Solutions at USDA USDA is taking steps to create modern solutions to the challenge of climate change.

"AMS Deputy Administrator, Livestock and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 28,  USDA is as American as baseball and apple pie. Almost anything and everything about U.S. food – and in some respects, baseball – is somehow connected to USDA. Curious? Read on to see how USDA ties in to the World Series. “The Ryan Express” Delivers the Goods Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan pitched 27 years in the big leagues, tossing a league record seven no-hitters. In that span Ryan was comfortably pumping 100 mile-per-hour fastballs past hitters until he was 40 years old, registering 95 mph on the radar gun until retirement. Nicknamed “The Ryan Express” for his baseball exploits, he went on to become a successful business owner. Ryan knows a good deal when he sees one. In he became a principal owner, president and CEO of the Texas Rangers baseball club. The team has made it to the World Series the last two seasons: losing to the San Francisco Giants in and participating in the thrilling, nail-biting autumn classic of against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ryan also knows the value of the USDA shield. He’s the head of the Nolan Ryan Guaranteed Tender Beef Program, a marketing program verified by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). AMS relies on university-researched and industry-recognized standards to determine which marketing claims it chooses to verify. Companies like Ryan’s can approach AMS and request the agency verify marketing claims such as “guaranteed tender” to assure customers that the products listed on packaging are exactly what they claim.  This is an important service to consumers who desire a certain quality of beef and want third-party assurance that their beef purchases meet exacting requirements. _________________________________________________________________________________________ USDA Certified – St. Louis (Cardinals) Style If you bellied-up at a local sports bar and ordered a plate of St. Louis Style ribs while watching the World Series, thank a former USDA employee for naming the cut of pork. In the late s Steve Olson, an agricultural marketing specialist in the USDA Livestock and Seed Program’s Standardization Division, wrote meat standards for the Agricultural Marketing Service’s Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS). Last June Olson shared his story about naming the cut of meat with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He explained how some butchers fancied carving off the breast bone and brisket bones from pork spareribs. “We did a survey to find out if there was a consensus for what this was called,” Olson told the Post-Dispatch. A majority of the respondents called it a St. Louis cut. “The only reason I went ahead and put the term into the IMPS is because I happen to be an avid St. Louis Cardinals baseball team fan, and they had just defeated the San Francisco Giants in a playoff,” Olson said. For more specifications, you can view the latest IMPS report. On pages 11 and 32, Item No. 416A is listed as “Pork Spareribs, St. Louis Style.” St. Louis ribs, ready to eat.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator and Dave Tuckwiller, AMS Commodity Procurement Program Director in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 11,  “We create opportunities for American ag businesses,” said Casey Wong-Buehler, AMS Commodity Procurement Program Specialist. “Trips like this help us ensure that our procurement requirements provide a realistic framework for our vendors to successfully supply quality food.” Across the country, schools are back in session. Here at the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), our inspectors and procurement specialists work hard to make sure that quality, domestically-produced foods are delivered to students and other recipients for our federal food purchasing programs. As students are getting used to their new schedules, we would like to highlight how our own little field trip shed some light on a typical day for some of our employees. A team of AMS employees recently traveled to Knouse Foods, a grower-owned cooperative that supplies apple and cranberry products for federal food purchasing programs. The employees saw first-hand how USDA inspectors help Knouse and other companies verify the quality of their products. As the apple sauce traveled through the facility, USDA inspectors pulled random samples to make sure that they met product quality and condition requirements. All USDA Foods are to be inspected, and in this case, inspectors pulled samples of apple sauce to evaluate traits like its color, flavor, and consistency. As an independent third-party, the inspections help suppliers meet USDA Foods requirements but they also can help them meet requirements from other buyers. The tour also covered another important part of the procurement process – the delivery. In addition to the food inspection requirement, all contracts for federal food purchasing programs require delivery trucks to be inspected. The team got a chance to see this process, called check-loading. USDA inspectors checked the condition of the trailers, making sure that the trailer is clean, doesn’t contain any holes, and has updated inspection codes.  For the Commodity Procurement Program specialists, the trip gave them a chance to see how some of the contract provisions are carried out by both the suppliers and USDA inspectors. Whether it’s telling them about the procurement process or product specifications and requirements, the procurement specialists are always in constant contact with their vendors. The recent trip helped the specialists see how the vendors incorporate inspections and check-loading into their business plans. They saw how long it takes for trucks to be inspected and the impact it has on their deliveries. All of us here at AMS are proud to play a role in supporting American ag businesses by ensuring that they can provide quality, wholesome foods to our students and other federal food purchase program recipients. We wish all of our students a successful school year. We encourage businesses to learn more about how our Specialty Crops Inspection Division and our Commodity Procurement Program can support their business. “Ensuring the product quality of our USDA Foods is extremely important,” said USDA Specialty Crops Inspection (SCI) Division employee Michael Harutinian. “Our employees pull random samples, helping our suppliers increase their confidence in the quality of their products,” said Harutinian.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Jun 07,   Dr. Joanna Zablotsky Kufel discovered community and public health at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Afterwards, she worked in public health for a couple of years and then moved to Baltimore, Md., where she earned her Masters in and Ph.D. in at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “After learning all about food safety at the state and local level, I still wanted to learn more about food safety at the federal level, where you can influence food safety throughout the entire food chain,” said Dr. Zablotsky Kufel. Dr. Zablotsky Kufel began her career with USDA as a summer intern working for the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS). Today she works as a Public Health Food Safety Analyst with FSIS, analyzing from across FSIS gathered by inspectors in the field, and partner agencies to evaluate FSIS policies and performance. The analyses performed and produced allow FSIS to effectively use science and to understand foodborne illness and emerging trends, respond to those risks and ensure that food safety inspection aligns with decreasing those risks. Dr. Zablotsky Kufel and her colleagues developed the “All Illness Measure”, a key measure of FSIS’ performance that helps assess whether the work that FSIS employees perform is having an effect on how often people get sick from food that FSIS regulates. “We use a public health approach that involves Assurance – Measurement – Refinement to ensure the food supply is safe,” she explained. “FSIS Inspection Program Personnel work to make sure that regulated product is safe and produced in accordance with FSIS policies (Assurance). We then measure FSIS’ impact on the public's health and determine whether our policies and activities are having a positive effect (Performance Measurement). This allows FSIS to evaluate existing policy methodologies and create new and innovative approaches to further prevent foodborne illness (Policy Development/Refinement).” The cycle, incorporated in FSIS’ - Strategic Plan, creates a feedback loop that helps FSIS modernize and better address existing and emerging food safety threats. Dr. Zablotsky Kufel also works with CDC and FDA analysts on the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration to determine what foods cause human illness. “In the next 5 years, I see CDC, FDA and FSIS working together even more closely to prevent illness and having a more real-time understanding of what causes illness—with the ability to react much more rapidly to emerging trends,” Dr. Zablotsky Kufel explained. “I really enjoy working with some of the best minds in public health and food safety to figure out how best to use the we have, identify new sources of , understand why people get sick and learn how we can prevent outbreaks in the future.” Faces of Food Safety is an initiative by FSIS to introduce Americans to the real people who work every day to keep the food in their own homes and yours safe.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Apr 17,  A Conservation Innovation Grant recipient accepts award from the U.S. Water Alliance. Photo courtesy NRCS. When USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded a Conservation Innovation Grant to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in , the notion of administering the nation’s largest water quality trading program in the Ohio River Basin was a twinkle in the eye of EPRI scientist Jessica Fox. Fast forward to —the multi-state water-trading program is a reality, and the Institute was one of three entities to be awarded this year’s Water Prize by the U.S. Water Alliance. Through Conservation Innovation Grants, NRCS funds projects that develop innovative approaches and technologies for natural resource conservation on agricultural lands. These grants have funded more than 60 environmental markets projects, including a number of the nation’s leading market efforts. EPRI’s program, launched when the states of Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana signed a multi-state compact in , works with agricultural producers who voluntarily implement conservation practices that reduce nutrient runoff into local waters. Through the program’s first trades in March , three energy companies purchased these credits and retired them for associated nutrient and ecosystem benefits. On April 13, In front of a crowded auditorium at the National Geographic Society in Washington, DC, Former EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Perciasepe awarded the prize to Fox who accepted on behalf of EPRI. Perciasepe expressed admiration for EPRI’s ability to innovate and engage stakeholders from Duke Energy to the Ohio Farm Bureau, and everyone in between. In her award acceptance remarks, Fox noted that part of the project’s success is that EPRI was never satisfied with developing the nation’s largest water quality trading program, or executing the first trades. “We are always pushing and striving, looking forward to the next chapter.” The next chapter for the Institute begins on May 20 when it holds a public auction for nutrient credits in New York City. These credits were generated through the installation of cover crops, livestock fencing and other conservation practices on 30 farms last summer.

"Developing National Dietary Guidance for the Birth to 24 Months Age Group  Good nutrition is vital to optimal infant and toddler growth, development, and health. The importance of this age group has been emphasized by First Lady Michelle Obama, who said that “If our kids get into the habit of getting up and playing, if their palates warm up to veggies at an early age, and if they’re not glued to a TV screen all day, they’re on their way to healthy habits for life.” So, making sure that even the youngest infants and toddlers are on the road to a healthy life is critical, and having national dietary guidance for infants and children from birth to 24 months can help make this happen. The Dietary for Americans (DGA) provides sound advice for making food and physical activity choices that promote good health and a healthy weight, and help prevent disease for Americans, including Americans at increased risk of chronic disease. The DGA has traditionally focused on adults and children 2 years of age and older.

"The Buried Forest of Alaska's Kruzof Island: a Window into the Past  Seldom does one find a way to directly date a prehistoric volcanic eruption, but 11-year-old Blake LaPerriere opened such a door for excited scientists in Southeast Alaska. Last September, Blake, his parents, and his younger brothers were exploring a beach on southwestern Kruzof Island, part of the Tongass National Forest landscape and just west of Sitka, Alaska, where they live. Blake investigated a deeply incised creek behind a pile of beach drift where he found a standing burnt tree embedded in a tall bank of pumice. He brought it to his family’s attention, asking “Do you think that’s from a volcanic eruption a long time ago?” Curious, Blake’s father Zach took photos and sent them my way.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA, Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Research and Science  Sep 13,  The brown marmorated stink bug, a winged pest from Asia that is eating crops and infesting U.S. homes. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists are launching a campaign to ask volunteers to count the number of stink bugs in their homes. USDA-ARS photo by Stephen Ausmus. Calling all insect enthusiasts and frustrated gardeners!  USDA scientists need your help in documenting Brown Marmorated Stink Bugs (BMSB) in your home. Beginning September 15th through October 15th, we’re asking citizens across the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to record daily counts of this pest on the exterior of their homes, along with their location and the time of each count. While USDA scientists are focusing on the Mid-Atlantic region, any they can get from other U.S. regions would also be helpful to their research. The quest to find out just how many stink bugs there are, and how they behave, is the brainchild of a consortium of researchers from USDA, the University of Maryland, Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, Virginia Tech, the Northeastern IPM Center, Oregon State University, North Carolina State University, Cornell University, the University of Delaware and Washington State University. This project is represented on the website, “Stop BMSB (www.stopbmsb.org),” which was launched in . The project involves more than 50 scientists who are investigating the impact BMSB have on grapes, orchard crops, small fruits, ornamental crops and vegetables, as well as ways to prevent or minimize the pest’s impact. BMSB have been found in 40 states and have caused the most damage in the Mid-Atlantic region. The value of at-risk crops where BMSB have been established or identified exceeds $21 billon. Because landscape features such as woodlands, structures, roads and different land use types affect the spread of the insects, it is important to collect related to BMSB locations. BMSB survive cold winter temperatures near farmland in homes, office buildings and warehouses. Scientists are just beginning to understand how landscape features will be a key component in combating stink bugs. Volunteers willing to count their stink bugs can contact USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologists Tracy Leskey (tracy.leskey@ars.usda.gov), Doo-Hyung Lee or Torri Hancock at 725-, at the ARS Appalachian Fruit Research Laboratory in Kearneysville, West Virginia.

"Painting Utah Agriculture by the Numbers  The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census data and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. Utah agriculture is varied and prevalent across the state. The 2012 Census of Agriculture showed that our farms and ranches occupy 10.97 million acres of land, or more than a fifth of the total land in Utah. In 2012, our state’s farmers sold more than $1.8 billion worth of agricultural products, with one-third in crop sales and two-thirds in livestock and poultry and their products. In contrast to sales, farm and ranch expenses totaled almost $1.6 billion with feed and labor being the two highest expenditures.  According to a survey done by Utah State University in 2012, when multiplier effects are included, agricultural processing and production account for $17.5 billion in total economic output in our state.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Illinois in  Conservation  Initiatives  Oct 28,  Students and teachers at Ready School, Prosperity Garden’s staff and volunteers tend the gardens to provide fresh produce to the surrounding community. On a small parcel of land in the heart of the City of Champaign, Illinois, are two gardens that offer opportunities for neighbors and the community to learn about growing food, eating nutritious food and earning a living. The Prosperity Gardens are educational, bringing at-risk students to work the ground, grow the plants and sell the produce at local farmer’s markets. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was able to help support this important endeavor through The People’s Garden, USDA’s collaborative community garden initiative with more than 1,300 local and national organizations all working together to establish community and school gardens across the country. Nicole Bridges, University of Illinois Extension Service employee and local Garden Programmer, oversees the activities at the Prosperity Gardens and has been instrumental in gaining neighbor and community support. Bridges did a lot of research when she first started with the garden. She attended local meetings to become familiar with the people who live there and listened when they said, “Our youth need jobs.” Nicole Bridges, garden programmer, sits next to one of the many garden beds. Working with a friend from the Ready School, a school for at-risk high school students, a plan was created to get students to the garden as a class project and then, “The project just exploded,” said Bridges. Josephine Tritsch, Instructor and Program Coordinator at Ready School, teaches agricultural classes and is expanding the curriculum to include business classes. “I am teaching agribusiness this fall, which includes selling vegetables to staff and harvesting for the cafeteria in our nascent Farm2School program,” Tritsch explained. “Class content includes marketing, grain and vegetable production, national and international ag practices, and so forth, through guided team projects and the use of Google apps.” Next spring, Tritsch plans to teach a horticulture class and will co-teach classes in job skills and nutrition. The students worked in the garden and sold their produce at markets during the summer and early fall. Tritsch said, “The community seemed to enjoy buying from us at both the downtown Champaign market and through our Mobile Market program.” The Prosperity Gardens staff is also starting a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) option to be managed by students. In addition to the garden contributing agricultural education and business aspects year-round, during the summer the garden serves as a job site. With the help of Master Gardeners and volunteers, the Prosperity Gardens hosted children from the Boys and Girls Club, who call their group the “Garden Club,” for nine weeks in the summer. Each student, ranging from six-to-eight years old, had their own plot about two-foot square. They planted a bean and watched it grow. “Each student takes ownership of their plot to understand what is happening during the growing season,” said Bridges. “They learn about bugs, both good and bad.” They also learn about different types of soil and other science facts. The beds were color coordinated and contained “garden maps,” that helped students understand what plants look like from garden to plate. There was a sensory garden full of herbs to stimulate more of their senses and they learned about nutrition. “We have kid-friendly knives and they learn how to peel carrots and chop celery, peppers and herbs,” said Bridges. “So each week, they learn to pick, wash and prepare their snack, like toasted wheat bagels and they made the veggie cream cheese.” Some children have been coming for three years and now mentor the younger ones. Bridges’ goal for these neighborhood gardens is to close the gap between the older generation and younger generation. “The garden club does just that – it gets these kids at a young age and reintroduces a traditional way of life.” The rest of the planting beds, including a lot across the street, are for the students to grow, harvest and sell a wide variety of produce that neighbors could enjoy. “They grew produce that is culturally relevant with the neighborhood taste, such as collards, green beans, okra, jalapeno peppers, and other items that people in the community enjoy,” said Bridges. The Prosperity Gardens are a non-profit and they have received donations and grants from local businesses, hospitals, a church and the University of Illinois Extension Service. “With NRCS’ contributions we purchased items we’ve needed for some time,” said Bridges. They were able to purchase produce crates for harvesting, storing and use at the market. “They sanitize well, collapse for storage, and have made us more productive where we meet agriculture food safety requirements to attend the farmers markets,” she adds. They currently lease the two garden lots from the city. A new grant will help build a wash and pack facility and they are searching for another acre of city land to house that facility and potentially install high tunnels to extend the growing season. Bridge’s goal is to establish the city’s first commercial urban farm. Currently the gardens are split between education, nutrition, and marketing the produce. Once the farm and facility is built and functioning, the current gardens will be dedicated to education. The future hope for Prosperity Gardens is to expand the Farm2School Program and include other youth organizations. “The Boys and Girls Club would like to expand their program beyond the six-to-eight-year-olds as well, making it a great place to learn and have fun,” said Bridges. Garden Club children and volunteers fix lunch under the pergola at one of the Prosperity Gardens.

"NIFA Public Affairs in  Research and Science  Dec 15,   This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. As we look back on , NIFA is also celebrating the partnership we have developed with the nation’s land-grant universities (LGUs), who play a critical role teaching students to meet the high quality, innovative research needs that are vital to the production of our country’s food, fuel, and fiber. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture provides support to historically black colleges and universities that were designated at as LGUs in the Second Morrill Act in .  Grants to these universities support research, extension, and teaching in the food and agricultural sciences by building the institutional capacities of these schools.  Looking back on , here are 5 highlights. 1. s land-grant universities: Providing access and enhancing opportunities Historically black land-grant universities celebrated the 125th anniversary of the Second Morrill Act in August .  There are 19 land-grant universities in 18 states, including Central State University in Ohio, which as established under the Farm Bill.  USDA’s  National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) administers a number of LGU education grant programs that support projects that strengthen teaching, research, Extension, and facility programs in the food and agricultural sciences.

That changed quickly, however, at one of the foremost agricultural schools in the country, Tuskegee University, where she said, many people “helped me, guided me, and cared about my success.”  Today, Brooks has a Ph.D. in microbiology and is a leader in the Land-Grant University (LGU) System as the Executive Director of the Association of Research Directors. Dr. Carolyn Brooks had little exposure to agriculture while growing up in the city but, thanks to a love for biology nurtured at a ’s Land Grant University, she knows plenty now and even served as dean of the School of Agricultural and Natural Sciences at the University of Maryland, Eastern Shore, MD.

Alston’s DNA; he’s a third generation LGU agricultural scholar whose passion for giving back led to the creation of a program that provides students access to educational tools that weren’t accessible before.  While drafting his version of the perfect curriculum, he encountered students who lacked transferable credits from their two-year degree programs.  Alston wanted them to have the opportunity, so he developed the “2+2: Online Studies program.” Dr. Antoine Alston is professor and associate dean for academic studies in North Carolina A&T State University’s School of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences. He is a nationally recognized student mentor, agricultural educator, and expert in the areas of diversity and inclusion. (Photo courtesy of Antoine Alston) 4. Second Morrill Act redux: America’s land-grant universities academic par excellence Booker T. Washington.  George Washington Carver.  Educators par excellence.  Pioneers in food and agricultural scientific research. Dedicated their lives to helping “lift the veil of ignorance” by bringing knowledge to African-Americans and others with limited resources.  In the 125th year of their founding the family of LGUs, which includes 19 institutions in 18 states, continues its legacy of innovations; examples of recent innovations are cited. USDA joins everyone celebrating 125 years of the Second Morrill Act, which has provided educational opportunities for all. 5. There’s something fishy going on in Petersburg’s food desert In the midst of a food desert, Virginia State University (VSU) Cooperative Extension is teaching students how to create and operate sustainable urban farming, and helping feed the community while they’re doing it.  VSU purchased a large empty warehouse in downtown Petersburg and converted it into an aquaponics production center where they raise fish and grow plants in nutrient-rich water.  The indoor urban farm produces vegetables, herbs, and protein year-round and with a minimal environmental footprint. Virginia State University used a NIFA grant to purchase facilities where they teach aquaponics and urban farming. The operation allows them to both raise fish and grow vegetables in a symbiotic environment.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  May 09,   As National Moving Month, May marks the height of the moving season.  It also marks a time of great peril for America’s forests.  Gypsy moths normally get their best chance to spread across the country in May as they hitchhike with people moving or traveling from an infested area to a noninfested area.  This year should be different, however, thanks to an outreach campaign called “Your Move Gypsy Moth-Free” that USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) recently launched. The stakes are high: Gypsy moth caterpillars can defoliate, weaken, and kill more than 300 different types of trees and shrubs.  Since , this dangerous forest pest has defoliated ates.  If left unchecked, an infestation can defoliate up to 13 million acres of trees in one season.  New infestations are typically caused by gypsy moth egg masses that people transport accidentally when moving or traveling from an infested area to a noninfested area.  That’s why APHIS requires these individuals to inspect for and remove gypsy moth egg masses from outdoor household items—before they move. Gypsy moth campaign logo People planning a move can learn all about they need to know at the campaign’s Web site, YourMoveGypsyMothFree.com.  They can download a brochure there that has pictures of all the gypsy moth life stages and instructions on how to remove the egg masses to ensure a move that’s gypsy moth-free. Fortunately, it’s easy to stop the spread of gypsy moth.  Just inspect your vehicles and all outdoor household goods for egg masses and remove them.  Female gypsy moths lay their egg masses on just about any outdoor surface: vehicles, yard tools, playground equipment, outdoor toys, grills, lawn furniture, camping gear, and the like.  Remove the egg masses with a putty knife or a stiff brush and dispose of them in a container of hot, soapy water, or placed them in a plastic bag, seal it, and set it in the sun. The brochure has a checklist to make this as simple as possible.  Check off each item as you go through the checklist and then sign it.  You can also hire a state-licensed pesticide applicator to do the inspection for you.  The signed checklist becomes your official inspection certificate for the move. Federal law requires that people moving from a moth-infested area to a noninfested area carry this certificate during the move.  Keep a copy of the completed checklist in the moving van in case it is requested by a State or Federal official at any point during your trip.  This completed checklist will satisfy the requirements of all noninfested States.  It will also relieve you of liability should your items be re-inspected by a State official in the destination State—and be found to harbor gypsy moth.

"Posted by Clifford Sánchez, NRCS New Mexico in  Conservation  Jan 19,  Assessing the Track Fire aftermath: NRCS New Mexico employee Brian Schwebke (far right), a member of the NRCS Damage Survey Report Team, and officials of the City of Raton, view a sediment pond.  Disaster struck northern New Mexico on June 12, , as the human-caused “Track Fire” exploded north of Raton, in Colfax County. Within 72 hours, 27,790 acres were scorched in New Mexico and Colorado. Luckily, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) was able to begin the restoration of the Lake Maloya watershed area almost immediately through its Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program. The Track Fire severely damaged nearby Lake Maloya, burning nearly 75 percent of the watershed at what firefighters call “high” and “moderate intensity levels.” This watershed is part of Sugarite Canyon State Park and provides habitat for many species of wildlife. It also serves as Raton’s primary water supply. The fire incinerated almost all of the vegetation surrounding Lake Maloya, leaving a thick layer of ash that easily washed downhill when it rained, clouding the waters of the lake. Raton’s water processing plant struggled to sufficiently filter drinking water. Raton and Colfax County immediately contacted NRCS for assistance, and an EWP team formed to assess the damage and prescribe treatments. NRCS implemented plans to restore the land in July. Through EWP, NRCS applies conservation practices that provide protection against further damages after natural disasters occur on private, tribal and state lands. To protect the water quality of Lake Maloya—and preserve Raton’s water supply—NRCS implemented erosion control measures, such as the building of several small dams, the erection of catchment fences, grass seeding and mulching. Post-Track Fire seeding takes hold: aerial seeding of one of the slopes scarred by the Track Fire proves successful as vegetation sprouts days after the aerial seeding. NRCS also strategically felled trees, which were laid perpendicular to the hill slope. Those areas were then seeded with quick-growing vegetation to slow down water flowing to low-lying areas, allowing the water to drain into the ground. In addition, Lake Dorothey, a smaller lake upstream of Lake Maloya, was drained into Lake Maloya and converted into a sediment basin. The City of Raton and Colfax County provided 25 percent of the cost of the land restoration efforts, with NRCS providing the rest. It will take years to restore the land to its pre-Track Fire state. But NRCS’ restoration efforts will accelerate the recovery process of the watersheds, wildlife habitat and recreational sites.  Find out more about the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) Program.

"APHIS Public Affairs Specialist in  Animals  Plants  Jul 11,  A gypsy moth caterpillar on a leaf in Massachusetts While being outside in Massachusetts this June, I first noticed it.  A lot of leaves were falling from the trees, only these were chewed leaf parts, not whole leaves. Similar to the children's book, The Very Hungry Caterpillar written by Eric Carle, some leaves didn’t just have chew marks but actual holes going straight through them.  Unlike the children’s book, this damage isn’t being caused by a friendly caterpillar who turns into a butterfly.  Instead it’s the result of ravenous gypsy moth caterpillars feeding…and feeding.  It’s so bad that in some areas, on walkways and roadways, it looks like fall.  Brown, dried up leaves are a contrast to summer’s lush greenery. What comes along with all the feeding and falling leaf parts?  Caterpillar feces, everywhere.  It too covers walkways and roadways.  And you don’t have to listen hard to hear the feeding, or the leaves and feces dropping.  The chewing is constant and so are the droppings.  It almost sounds like rain falling, continuously.  I regret that I did not take a picture of a car covered with caterpillar feces that I saw at the grocery store this weekend, which looked like it had peppercorns stuck all over it.  Don’t park under a tree, or like everything else, your car will be covered. Gypsy moth is not everywhere in the United States.  It’s primarily in the northeast to mid-west, and it’s Federal and State agriculture officials’ goal to not let it spread further.  You can do your part to help by finding out if you are in an area that already has gypsy moth, and if you’re not, report any gypsy moth egg masses or caterpillars on trees to Federal or State agriculture officials.  Also, the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is asking folks to check for gypsy moth before you move to a new area by inspecting your outdoor household articles (lawn furniture, yard equipment, outdoor toys, etc.) for gypsy moth egg masses and remove them.  It's not just the right thing to do—it's also the law. And now it’s easier than ever because APHIS just made its gypsy moth inspection checklist a fillable (page 2 of our gypsy moth factsheet) that can be digitally signed, making it acceptable in all situations where the form is . The gypsy moth caterpillars here in Massachusetts are ruining thousands of trees, changing the way the landscape looks.  The crabapple tree I planted two years ago didn’t bloom this year, and it may not survive these gypsy moth caterpillar attacks.  Please help prevent this insect from moving to other areas by visiting www.HungryPests.com to learn more about gypsy moth and other invasive pests we don’t want in the United States.

"Program Analyst, U.S. Codex Office in  Health and Safety  Jun 08,  This year’s World Food Safety Day theme is “food safety is everyone’s business.” One group with members around the world is focused on the business of science-based food standards to protect consumer health. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) was established in by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. Codex drafts international food standards, , and codes of practice collectively known as Codex Alimentarius, meaning “food code” in Latin. One hundred and eighty-seven member countries and organizations compose the membership of Codex. Additionally, Codex has more than 200 intergovernmental and international nongovernmental observer organizations. Altogether, Codex membership represents about 99% of the world’s population. Public concerns about food safety issues often place Codex at the center of global discussion. The United States Codex Office (USCO), housed in USDA’s Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs, leads the U.S. Codex Program. Each day, USCO international issues analysts work with regulatory scientists and experts from various U.S. government agencies and nongovernment stakeholders to facilitate coordination, strategic planning, and outreach events on food standards. “We strive to make the world a safer place through safer food” said Marie Maratos Bhat, an analyst for the USCO who covers pesticide residues and food hygiene issues. Ultimately, these efforts benefit consumers by providing greater assurance of the safety of imported foods. Trade organizations and agricultural producers also benefit because Codex standards open markets to fair trade in safe food. It is the USCO’s mission to engage stakeholders in the development and advancement of science-based food standards for the benefit of the United States and the worldwide community.

"and William Shoutis, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 12,  Understanding soil carbon graphic. Graphic credit: Aurora Cutler and Cheryl Ziebart (Click to enlarge) As the climate changes, and our forests are affected, the need to reclaim impacted areas and restore native species becomes more important than ever. The U.S. Forest Service’s Monongahela National Forest is at the forefront of not only forest restoration, but also helping those landscapes adapt to climate change. The red spruce forests of the Appalachian highlands are an integral part of the regional biodiversity, providing habitat and food for the northern flying squirrel and the Cheat Mountain Salamander, and the ecosystem supports 240 rare species in West Virginia alone. Additionally, the forests blanket the headwaters of five major river systems upstream of millions of people living and working in the Charleston, West Virginia; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Washington D.C. regions. “Different soils have the ability to store different amounts of carbon, and Appalachian soils have potential to store carbon for the long-term if managed correctly. There is evidence of this in the soil profiles under the historic red spruce ecosystem,” said Stephanie Connolly, Forest Soil Scientist on the Monongahela forest. Most of the soil carbon in the world is found in the cool, moist conifer forests of the north. There is more carbon in the soils than in the atmosphere and the vegetation combined. Historically, timber harvesting of red spruce has resulted in large losses of soil carbon into the atmosphere. Forest Service scientists are helping figure out how to better manage these forests long term to restore lost soil carbon. The restoration of red spruce to its historic range could restore much of the lost soil carbon within a century, improve wildlife habitat, and protect water resources. In West Virginia alone, recent suggests that carbon—equivalent to 56.4 million barrels of oil—could be taken out of the atmosphere and incorporated in the forest floor within 80 years. Regional Forester Review at the Lambert Run Red Spruce Restoration Project with forest leadership, forest staff, and partners. Photo credit: Crystal Simons, Davis and Elkins College Student Intern One example of this work is the work of Monongahela National Forest staff and their partners at The West Virginia Highlands Conservancy and The Nature Conservancy who are working to restore historic red spruce forests on lands that were previously strip-mined for coal. The Lambert Run lands were mined in the s and s resulting in heavy soil compaction and the introduction of non-native plants. While earlier restoration efforts stabilized the land for erosion control, many areas remain in a condition scientist term “arrested succession.” The partnership uses machinery to break soil compaction and allow water to infiltrate the ground making it healthier to support the native spruce and reestablish critical habitat. Wetlands are being constructed to retain water and support native plant systems. Hardwoods and Norway pine are being removed from the Lambert Run in preparation for the planting of red spruce seedlings. After this kind of restoration work prepares the soil, the Monongahela forest staff work with climate change specialists to create adaptation management plans to enhance long-term resiliency of the newly restored forests. Together partnerships like this return forested areas into living tools that benefit all of us now and for generations to come.

"AMS Deputy Administrator, Livestock and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 28,  USDA is as American as baseball and apple pie. Almost anything and everything about U.S. food – and in some respects, baseball – is somehow connected to USDA. Curious? Read on to see how USDA ties in to the World Series. “The Ryan Express” Delivers the Goods Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan pitched 27 years in the big leagues, tossing a league record seven no-hitters. In that span Ryan was comfortably pumping 100 mile-per-hour fastballs past hitters until he was 40 years old, registering 95 mph on the radar gun until retirement. Nicknamed “The Ryan Express” for his baseball exploits, he went on to become a successful business owner. Ryan knows a good deal when he sees one. In he became a principal owner, president and CEO of the Texas Rangers baseball club. The team has made it to the World Series the last two seasons: losing to the San Francisco Giants in and participating in the thrilling, nail-biting autumn classic of against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ryan also knows the value of the USDA shield. He’s the head of the Nolan Ryan Guaranteed Tender Beef Program, a marketing program verified by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). AMS relies on university-researched and industry-recognized standards to determine which marketing claims it chooses to verify. Companies like Ryan’s can approach AMS and request the agency verify marketing claims such as “guaranteed tender” to assure customers that the products listed on packaging are exactly what they claim.  This is an important service to consumers who desire a certain quality of beef and want third-party assurance that their beef purchases meet exacting requirements. _________________________________________________________________________________________ USDA Certified – St. Louis (Cardinals) Style If you bellied-up at a local sports bar and ordered a plate of St. Louis Style ribs while watching the World Series, thank a former USDA employee for naming the cut of pork. In the late s Steve Olson, an agricultural marketing specialist in the USDA Livestock and Seed Program’s Standardization Division, wrote meat standards for the Agricultural Marketing Service’s Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS). Last June Olson shared his story about naming the cut of meat with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He explained how some butchers fancied carving off the breast bone and brisket bones from pork spareribs. “We did a survey to find out if there was a consensus for what this was called,” Olson told the Post-Dispatch. A majority of the respondents called it a St. Louis cut. “The only reason I went ahead and put the term into the IMPS is because I happen to be an avid St. Louis Cardinals baseball team fan, and they had just defeated the San Francisco Giants in a playoff,” Olson said. For more specifications, you can view the latest IMPS report. On pages 11 and 32, Item No. 416A is listed as “Pork Spareribs, St. Louis Style.” St. Louis ribs, ready to eat. This popular cut of pork was named by Steve Olson, a Cardinals baseball fan and USDA employee. Photo by Ernesto Andrade.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 06,  Only the dock remains from a Bay Point, New Jersey residence after Hurricane Sandy hit. About two years ago, Hurricane Sandy wreaked havoc on several states in the Northeast, causing $68 billion dollars’ worth of damage to critical infrastructure, businesses, homes and landscapes. Since , multiple agencies, including the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), have remained committed to helping the region build back stronger and better prepared for future storms. To help the victims recover from Sandy and prevent future devastation in vulnerable flood areas, NRCS has invested about $120 million in Emergency Watershed Floodplain Easement Program, a program that helps restore and protect lands vulnerable to flooding. “This program will ensure long-term stability and help relieve the stress these landowners have been enduring for more than two years now,” said Andrew James, the program’s manager. The easement program complements traditional disaster recovery funding and allows NRCS to purchase a permanent easement on lands within floodplains that sustained damage from Sandy. Through the program, easements were placed on more than 1,000 acres in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. Restoration of floodplains improves the natural functions of the plain while establishing the flow of water back into the area. It protects properties downstream, and it enhances fish and wildlife habitat. It also improves water quality and ground water recharge.  Here are a few examples of how this easement program is working: West Haven, New Haven County, Connecticut: The neighborhoods near Beach Street were hit especially hard as homes were irreparably damaged and families had to be evacuated. NRCS will provide more than $7 million for the restoration and permanent protection of 31 properties, 15 funded through the first sign-up and 16 funded through the second sign-up. These properties cover 71 acres of vulnerable floodplain lands, including 11 acres of residential lots. Floodplain restoration and removal of structures will benefit both landowners and the surrounding community. Cumberland County, New Jersey: The Cumberland County application is the largest submitted to NRCS during the Hurricane Sandy recovery effort, consisting of more than 450 acres of marshy, flood prone property currently used to produce salt hay. The southern end of the area is adjacent to a large tract of state-owned open space land and the northern end is by a large NRCS wetlands easement. By linking these two properties together, the Cumberland County application serves to greatly increase the footprint of protected land in the area. This will allow for comprehensive restoration of the properties’ floodplain functions and values. Mastic/Shirley Area, Suffolk County, New York: Numerous small parcels of land, some with houses, located in this low-lying, 100-year floodplain on Long Island were severely impacted by Hurricane Sandy. NRCS’ investment of about $5.6 million on 45 acres will provide permanent protection and will provide a critical buffer to a densely developed residential area to the north of the enrolled lands. The Mastic/Shirley area is adjacent to the natural shoreline of the William Floyd Estate, a significant environmental area of 600 acres to the east owned by the U.S National Park Service and part of the Fire Island National Seashore. These easements will be complete in the coming months, providing places for floodwaters to go during times of heavy rains and other natural disasters like Sandy. “Just like we work with farmers to invest in the health of their soil, which will lead to bigger harvest down the road – this program enables us to work with landowners to help prevent damage from flooding in the future,” James said.

"New Study Offers Sage Advice  For many, one of the New Year’s first big chores is to remove a tree from inside their home. Trees, beautiful and useful as they are, do not belong everywhere. Such is the case with trees and other woody species that are expanding into the Western grasslands. Over the years, woody species like juniper, pinyon pine, redcedar and mesquite have encroached on grassland and sagebrush ecosystems, altering these landscapes and making them unsuitable for native wildlife like the lesser prairie-chicken and greater sage-grouse. Encroaching conifers also degrade rangelands for agricultural producers whose livestock rely on nutritious forage.

"Hoosier National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 25,  The Ohio River Foundation crewmembers Lydia Cook, Rose Guardino, Rose Johnson, Catherine Kagemann, Callie Schulenburg, and Brynne Taylor build a pollinator habitat. USFS Photo. Streams will flow more freely and bees will have a new home on the Hoosier National Forest, thanks to the work of six young women from central Indiana. The women -- recent high school graduates from Bloomington High School North and South, a high school senior from Bedford, Ind., and an Indiana University student – spent three weeks in July working on ecological restoration projects in the forest. The crew was hired by the Ohio River Foundation and funded through grants from Duke Energy-Indiana, the Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The crew’s first project was to reduce sediment in streams and tributaries that flow into the Ohio River. The crew “hardened” stream crossings by placing about 100 tons of gravel that will hold soil in place and reduce the impact of horses on the trails. The women also learned about ecological conservation. Steve Harris, a wildlife biologist on the Hoosier, taught the importance of pollinators in the forest by building a pollinator “condo.”  The condo consists of a four-by-four-foot wooden frame with large tree limbs stacked inside.  Holes and crevices are cut into the limbs to provide places for pollinators to nest in. “The idea is to build a habitat where native pollinators and other beneficial insects will want to live,” said Harris. Harris and the Ohio River Foundation crew spent a day designing and building the habitat.  They added their own special flair on the project by carving “HNF” and a peace sign into the log.  It is the only pollinator condo on the Hoosier so far. The crew was disappointed the following weekend when they learned that a camper used the bee condo for firewood.  The crew spent a second day rebuilding the habitat and posted a sign to alert campers that this was an important part of the forest and not firewood.

"USDA Northeast Regional Farm to School Lead and Katina Kefalas, Program Specialist, USDA Food and Nutrition Service Northeast Regional Office in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 07,  Connecticut service members serve local blueberry smoothies and continue farm to school efforts at summer meals sites. Over the past few summers, sponsors of USDA’s Summer Meals Programs have been elevating meal quality and encouraging program participation by serving seasonal menus, utilizing high quality ingredients, and providing nutrition education activities. We’ve heard of such farm to summer activities – the embedding of farm to school principles within summer meals programs – from practitioners all around the country. Here in the Northeast, summer brought a wave of coordinated programming, and National Farm to School Month is the perfect time to celebrate this trend that is supporting healthy kids and communities all year long! Vermont: Farm to School 12 Months a Year  Last year, VT FEED secured funding from a local philanthropic partner, and embarked upon a mission to extend its robust farm to school training, coordination, and professional development services beyond the school year. The Farm to School 12-Months of the Year project provided local procurement training and guidance for summer sponsors, piloted summer meals sites over the weekend at two farmers markets, and ran food and nutrition-related activities at 10 summer sites. By continuing the strategies that have built robust farm to school programs over many years throughout the summertime, Vermont is creating consistent learning opportunities and year-round access to nutritious foods for kids across the state. Massachusetts: Farmers Markets as Summer Meals Sites  Farm to summer strategies picked up steam elsewhere in the Northeast, as the Massachusetts Farm to School Project secured funding to support the opening of additional summer meals sites at natural access points for local foods and fun, healthy community activities: farmers markets! With additional planning and support from the Child Nutrition Outreach Program and Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, farmers market sites were piloted in five different communities across Massachusetts. By setting up a new site at the Greenfield, Mass., market, Greenfield Public Schools was able to add local fruits and vegetables to their menu from market producers and serve kids on Saturdays. Connecticut: Service Members Launch Farm to Summer Programming  Building new elements of programming – like finding and buying local foods, promoting healthy menu items, running taste tests or gardening activities that get kids excited about summer meals – all take additional time and coordination. Partners in Connecticut tapped a school year resource to help sponsors make this programming possible. Fifteen FoodCorps and ten AmeriCorps service members were trained and supported by UCONN Extension, End Hunger CT!, and FoodCorps CT, with help from a USDA Farm to School Grant, and were perfectly positioned to run farm to summer activities at summer meals sites throughout the state.

"Are Frogs on the Edge of Survival?  A lethal fungus is killing frogs and other water-dwelling amphibians all over the world, but a team of international scientists led by U.S. Forest Service scientist Deanna Olson is working to understand why. Olson, who works at the agency’s Pacific Northwest Research Station, and her colleagues have the daunting task of tracking the disease, known as the amphibian chytrid fungus. Unlike the clearly visible white-nose syndrome killing bats in the U.S., the frog fungus cannot be seen except with a microscope. That makes scientists’ jobs that much more difficult. Since the discovery of the malady is so recent, scientists still don’t understand a great deal about the fungus except that it affects the skin and ultimately leads to cardiac arrest in amphibians.

"Federal Grain Inspection Service Adds An Additional Layer of Wheat Quality Assurance  A perfect pie crust is often the measure of a top quality baker.  The “blue ribbon” pie crust is light and flaky.  Even the best baker’s skills, however, depend on the quality of the ingredients.  The quality of flour is based on the quality of the wheat – and measuring the quality of the wheat is a key responsibility of the Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS). FGIS and the Official Service Providers it supervises conduct Falling Number tests as a measure of wheat quality.  Scientists and technicians at FGIS’s National Grain Center will soon begin a quality assurance program to monitor these tests and verify the original results to ensure that any procedural issues that could possibly impact the results of these important tests are quickly addressed.  FGIS will monitor a percentage of all tests performed throughout the Official testing system.  Last year, over 25,000 Falling Number tests were performed on wheat targeted for sale domestically and abroad.

"APHIS Asian Longhorned Beetle Eradication Program in  Animals  Plants  Dec 17,  Two Asian longhorned beetles on maple tree Today is National Maple Syrup Day!  So, what does maple syrup have in common with an invasive insect?  Well, if the insect is the Asian longhorned beetle, then they both can come from maple trees.  Obviously, we want the maple syrup and not the invasive beetle.  But who cares?  And why should anyone care?  Well, I care and here’s why: Not only do I work for the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, an agency that is actively fighting known infestations of Asian longhorned beetle in three different states, but I also am a native of Vermont. According to a release about Maple Syrup Production issued by USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, Vermont is responsible for 40% of the United States’ maple production – that’s 1,320,000 gallons from just one tiny state!  It typically takes 50 gallons of sap to make one gallon of maple syrup.  A single maple tree can produce an average of 15 gallons of sap per season, so you need at least 3-4 maple trees just to make the one gallon of syrup.  Many Vermonters like to say they have maple syrup running through their veins; it’s simply that important, valued, needed and wanted. But the Asian longhorned beetle is a real threat to our country’s maples trees and to 12 other types of hardwood trees too.  It doesn’t belong here and we don’t want it here.  When the beetle attacks trees, its larva feed on the heartwood or center part causing tunneling that can make a cross-section of a tree look like a piece of Swiss cheese.  The damage weakens the tree and eventually the tree will die. The best line of defense is you.  In honor of National Maple Syrup Day, and for the love of all things maple, I am asking you to take a look at your trees.  If you are outside, just walk up to a tree and see if it has round holes on the trunk and/or branches – these holes are caused by the adult beetle when it exits the tree.  The holes are a little bit smaller than a dime and just a bit bigger than the circumference of a pencil.  You won’t see the adult as they die off with the first hard frost, but you can still see the holes and other signs of damage. The sooner we know about an ALB infestation, the sooner we can do something about it, so please report any sightings.  Long live National Maple Syrup Day!

"Communications Program Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), USDA in  Health and Safety  Jul 02,  Throwing a celebratory BBQ gathering this Fourth of July does not have to be stressful when it comes to the menu and food safety. As you prepare to welcome a large gathering of family and friends, keep these core food safety practices in mind:  Clean—Wash hands and surfaces often. Hands should be washed for 20 seconds with clean water and soap. If no running water is available, use hand sanitizer or moist towelettes that contain at least 60 percent alcohol.  Separate—Separate raw meats from other foods to avoid cross-contamination of harmful bacteria. Use separate cutting boards when preparing raw meat and poultry and other foods that are ready to eat, and use different utensils and platters when placing raw foods on the grill or smoker and taking cooked foods off.  Cook—Cook food to the safe minimum internal temperature as measured with a food thermometer. Burgers and other thin foods, such as sausages and boneless chicken thighs, should have the thermometer inserted through the side and into the center to get the most accurate thermometer reading.  Chill—Refrigerate food promptly within two hours (or one hour if the temperature is over 90 F). Keep hot foods hot above 140 F and cold foods cold below 40 F to avoid the Danger Zone. Hot foods like burgers, hot dogs, and chicken can be kept hot by placing them on a grill on low, in heated chafing dishes, or in a slow cooker, and cold foods like deviled eggs, salads, and guacamole can be nestled in a bed of ice.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Aug 22,  USDA’s Agricultural Research Service and Purdue University researchers are working together to develop biological controls that protect against white grubs, which eat turf grass roots. During the U.S. Open held this summer in Erin Hills, Wisconsin, some of the world’s top golfers competed for a shot at becoming the champion (won by Brooks Koepka). The course’s meticulously groomed putting greens and fairways—like those of so many other golf facilities—are an inspiration to lawn-care enthusiasts near and far. But professional golf course superintendents and lawn-loving homeowners alike face a common foe: chubby, C-shaped pests called “white grubs,” which eat the turf grass roots. Unchecked, they cause brown spots or barren patches that mar the turf’s aesthetic value and even playability. Robert Behle isn’t an avid golfer, and you won’t find him competing with his neighbors for the best-looking lawn. But he does know a thing or two about insects—and even more about controlling them using their natural enemies. An Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologist, Behle specializes in ways to formulate naturally occurring fungi and other microorganisms into bio-based pesticides. In fact, he and Purdue University colleague Doug Richmond recently finished a three-year project funded by the U.S Golf Association (USGA) to evaluate the potential of the fungus Metarhizium brunneum to kill white grubs, the larval stages of Japanese, June, and other scarab beetles. The practice, known as “biological control,” is one that’s already found its way onto some golf courses. Indeed, a survey by the Environmental Institute for Golf found that 42 percent of 27-plus-hole golf facilities sometimes or frequently use biocontrol in their pest management practices. The researchers used an ARS patent-pending process called “liquid culture fermentation” to mass-produce the fungus and turn it into clay granules, which they applied at different rates to grub-infested turf grass plots at Purdue University. When they rolled back patches of the turf, a grizzly sight awaited them. Depending on the rates applied, 50 to 70 percent of the grubs lay dead beneath the soil, covered in a fuzzy growth that confirmed the fungus had infected and killed them—typically 7 to 10 days after exposure. An insecticide applied to different plots worked even faster, killing 95 percent of the grubs. However, when used in the fall, the chemical had lost some of its “punch” against larger-sized grubs compared to the fungus, which worked better with the cooler temperatures.  The findings, which the researchers published in a USGA annual report, could help golf course superintendents identify ways to use the fungus as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which combines judicious insecticide use with cultural, biological and other controls. Golfers needn’t be distracted by the prospects of this biocontrol fungus quietly working underfoot, though. Its absolute preference for infecting white grubs and other insect turf eaters means people, pets and wildlife won’t suffer the same fuzzy fate as these pests.

"Seeing is Believing: Soil Health Practices and No-Till Farming Transform Landscapes and Produce Nutritious Food  This month, we’re highlighting 12 important gifts given to us when we conserve natural resources: soil, food, plants, wildlife, people, health, protection, recreation, air, water, technology and the future. NRCS’ mission is to conserve the full range of natural resources, but soil health is our foundation. And it’s the first conservation gift that we’re going to highlight. And without soil, we couldn’t celebrate with food. We encourage you to give the gift of conservation this season! Curbing Soil Erosion Soil is the foundation for a healthy environment. If you need proof that no-till farming works, look no further than the rolling hills of north-central Oregon.

"USDA Nebraska Public Information Coordinator in  Conservation  Rural  Jul 23,   President Obama’s America’s Great Outdoors Initiative came to Nebraska on July 12, when 200 attendees gathered in Grand Island for a listening session.  They were joined by Dave White, Chief of the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and senior representatives of the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and the Interior (DOI). USDA Nebraska leaders attending included NRCS State Conservationist Steve Chick, Rural Development State Director Maxine Moul and Farm Service Agency Executive Director Dan Steinkruger. Nebraska residents were given the opportunity to share with members of the Administration what is being done at the local, regional and state levels to connect Nebraskans to the outdoors and to help conserve natural resources. Prior to the America’s Great Outdoors Initiative listening session, a bus tour visited restored wetlands in the Rainwater Basin complex, including Trumbull Basin and additional sites south of Grand Island. NRCS Chief White made a major announcement of the funding of five projects totaling $9.8 million that will restore, enhance and protect high-priority wetlands and improve wildlife habitat through the Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program (WREP).  The financial assistance for the multiyear projects will protect and restore 2,440 acres of wetlands and associated habitats in four states, including Nebraska. Through WREP, the Rainwater Basin complex in south central Nebraska is receiving $750,000 for work on 240 acres this year.  This project, sponsored by Pheasants Forever, proposes restoring and protecting wetlands in an active agricultural landscape by allowing center pivots to cross wetlands, ensuring wetlands are compatible with the agriculture production in this region.  At the end of three years, 960 acres of wetlands and upland habitats adjacent to, and within, pivot circles will be restored. A panel of conservation leaders helped guide discussion about collaborative efforts that have protected Nebraska’s natural resources and encouraged Nebraskans to get outside and connect with nature.  Breakout sessions were held to gather ideas on what more can be accomplished by identifying what works, tools for success, challenges, and the federal government’s role. A youth session concluded the day’s events. NRCS Chief Dave White announces funding to restore Nebraska wetlands and wildlife habitat.

"NRCS Oregon in  Conservation  Jun 29,  Beth Hoinacki shows an aspect of her crop rotation and cover crop plan.  U.S. trends in organic farming point to a growing industry. USDA agencies like the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) support organic growers by offering funding and technical guidance—both to farmers already growing organic crops, and to those who want to transition to organic production. Luckily for Beth Hoinacki, she heard about NRCS’ Organic Initiative right around the same time that she was pursuing organic certification for her operation, Goodfoot Farm. Hoinacki and her husband, Adam Ryan, purchased 10 acres of land situated along the bank of the Luckiamute River in Kings Valley, Ore. in, which they later named “Goodfoot Farm.” They were interested in the Organic Initiative because it helps producers create a conservation plan and apply approved methods targeting specific concerns on their operation. NRCS District Conservationist Tom Snyder and Hoinacki look through her fence to the recently completed grass waterway and hedgerow funded by NRCS’ EQIP Organic Initiative.  Hoinacki credits the Initiative with helping them start projects critical to soil and water quality that they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to address on the farm, where they grow a variety of produce, including blueberries, onions, garlic, potatoes and winter squash. One project helped the couple install a grassed waterway to reduce erosion in order to minimize sediment runoff into the river and improve habitat for threatened and endangered fish. In addition, they’ve planted a hedgerow for pollinator habitat, pursued a waste management plan to protect water quality and developed crop rotation and installed cover crops to improve soil health. Two curly-feathered Sebastopol and two American lavender geese help control grass and weeds on Goodfoot Farm. Hoinacki says that they’ve recently been interested in biodynamic agriculture ­because it takes a more holistic approach to farming. She says that organic methods focus primarily on allowed off-farm inputs on crops or fields, whereas the biodynamic approach is more about creating a plan and purpose for a farm to realize its potential as a natural, self-sustaining system. Hoinacki’s goal is to have a natural system that reduces the need for pest and fertility products to be imported from off the farm. She says that the biodynamic method has influenced her thinking in designing the farm, and NRCS’ Organic Initiative allows her the flexibility to pursue her goals by supporting beneficial plant life for habitat and developing a natural ecosystem within the production system.

"USDA APHIS Public Affairs Specialist in  Animals  Plants  Apr 04,  Invasive feral swine have spread rapidly across the United States as a result of natural range expansion, illegal trapping and movement by people, and escapes from domestic swine operations and hunting preserves. Wild boar, razorback, feral hog, wild pig — these are just some of the names we attribute to one of the most destructive and formidable invasive species in the United States. Feral swine adapt to just about any habitat, have few natural enemies, and reproduce at high rates. As such, their population is growing rapidly nationwide. At 5 million animals and counting, feral swine are now found in at least 39 States and cause approximately $1.5 billion in damages and control costs each year. Their damage is diverse and includes destroying native habitats and crops, eating endangered species, and spreading disease. Natural resource managers, researchers and academics nationwide are grappling with how best to address the challenges of feral swine management. Feral swine are hunted by the public in some States for recreational purposes; but hunting will not solve our country’s feral swine problems. “Feral swine don’t know boundaries and what happens in one State affects neighboring States,” states APHIS’ new national feral swine initiative coordinator Dr. Dale Nolte. “Only through a concerted, comprehensive effort with the public and our State and Federal partners can we begin to turn the tide on feral swine expansion and reduce their negative impacts to our economy and environment.” The USDA and it partners hope to accomplish just that. In , APHIS Wildlife Services received $20 million from Congress to begin a collaborative, national feral swine management initiative with APHIS Veterinary Services and International Services, as well as numerous local, State, and Federal partners.  The goal of the initiative is to prevent the further spread of feral swine, as well as reduce their population, damage, and associated disease risks.  Though management efforts will occur in many different locations and habitats throughout the United States, these actions will be modified and adapted to best meet the needs and objectives of each State.  The initiative will be highlighted at the International Wild Pig Conference in Montgomery, Alabama, on April 14-16. For more information, please visit the APHIS feral swine web page. April is Invasive Plant, Pest, and Disease Awareness Month.  Learn more about APHIS Wildlife Services activities related to invasive wildlife.

"Food Driver Coordinator, Human Resources Department, USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Southwest Regional Office in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 28,  Lupe Gomez, Coordinator and WIC staff show their contributions to the food drive. This summer I had the honor of organizing the Feds, Farmers and Friends Feed Families Food Drive for the Southwest Region Food and Nutrition Service.  As the human resources liaison for the region, I don’t get the opportunity to work directly with partners or clients so this food drive gave me a very unique perspective on hunger.  I collected food items, sent out reminders to staff and ensured delivery of the food to the North Texas Food Bank. The Feds, Farmers, and Friends Feed Families program was USDA's contribution to the federal government-wide effort Feds Feed Families, led by the Office of Personnel Management. From June through September , USDA employees, farmers, and friends joined together to combat hunger and help children and families in need. This year's goal was to collect 1.2 million pounds of food from federal offices nationwide. I am proud to report that the Southwest Regional Office (SWR) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) staff donated 518 pounds of non-perishable food during the months of July and August.  We kept track of the donations by program area throughout the drive.  I am happy to report that the SWR Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children staff surpassed the donations made by all other program areas.  We have wrapped up our food drive for the summer and it has been a positive experience for everyone involved, especially FNS staff who had the opportunity to show who much they care about the community we serve – either on the job or through our volunteer efforts.

"Deputy Administrator of the AMS Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 13,  AMS verifies cage-free claims for shell eggs by visiting the farms twice each year to ensure that the eggs are in fact coming from a cage-free flock. (Click to view a larger version) When it comes to purchasing eggs, consumers have interests that go well beyond what they see in the carton.  For many buyers, where that egg came from and how it was produced are just as important as the finished product.  Organic, locally produced, cage-free, and free range are just a few of the marketing claims consumers will find on the carton, as producers try to communicate the attributes of their product.  To provide additional assurance to their customers of the validity of marketing claims, shell egg producers often enlist the services of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). In recent months, a long list of large volume food buyers – including restaurants, grocers, distributors and more – have announced they will transition to sourcing eggs and egg products only from cage-free production systems.  You can learn more about this trend in a recent USDA Blog post.  Many shell egg suppliers have already found a way to assure customers that products marketed as cage-free are indeed sourced from such systems: when USDA Graded eggs are also identified as cage-free, they must undergo a review process to verify the claim is truthful. Through its Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program, AMS provides shell egg quality grading and certification services to businesses on a voluntary, fee-for-service basis.  Egg cartons bearing the USDA Grade Shield – usually either “USDA Grade AA” or “USDA Grade A” – must meet strict U.S. quality standards.  In addition to verifying that eggs meet the stated grade, USDA’s highly-trained graders inspect processing facilities for proper sanitation and refrigeration, and verify proper identification and traceability methods such as code dating and plant numbers.  Further, packaging materials that bear a USDA Grade Shield must be pre-approved by USDA to ensure the labeling is truthful and not misleading.  This includes claims regarding the method of production (cage-free, free range, etc.), making the USDA Grade Shield a symbol of quality and integrity. Not all USDA graded eggs are cage-free, and not all cage-free eggs are graded by USDA.  But, eggs packed under a USDA Grade Shield and marketed as cage-free – or with any other production claim – must be source-verified by USDA through onsite farm visits, at least twice annually, to check that the laying hens are housed in the appropriate production system.  For AMS approval, cage-free eggs must be produced by hens housed in a way that allows for not only unlimited access to food and water, but, unlike eggs from caged hens, also provides them the freedom to roam during the laying cycle. We also know some consumers prefer their eggs to come from “free range” hens.  For those eggs, we verify they are produced by hens that are not only housed in a way that allows for unlimited access to food and water and provides the freedom to roam within the area like cage-free hens but also gives the hens continuous access to the outdoors during their laying cycle. At the processing facility, it’s not uncommon for cage-free eggs to be received alongside literally millions of non-cage-free eggs.  So, AMS requires a written and implemented segregation and traceability plan detailing how the company maintains the identity of the eggs from production through storage, transport, processing, and packaging.  Then, during packing, AMS verifies that only eggs sourced from the appropriate flocks are packaged into cartons bearing a USDA Grade Shield. Whether you are an agricultural business wanting to differentiate your product in the marketplace or a consumer looking for quality eggs, AMS grading and certification services ensure that quality and marketing claims are verified from farm to table.

"Pooling Resources for Scientific Breakthroughs  American farmers know about planting seeds—both in the ground and in groundbreaking research. While the seeds they plant as individual farmers feed and clothe the rest of us, the seeds they sow collectively through participation in research and promotion (R&P) programs are vitally important, too. Funded entirely by industry, agricultural R&P programs are a way for producers and businesses across a commodity industry to pool their resources to help market and improve their products.

"Southern Research Station, USDA Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 15,  John and Elizabeth Alter manage more than 1,000 acres of tree farms that were hit hard by Hurricane Michael. (Courtesy photo American Tree Farm System) Hurricane Michael, which roared through Florida, Alabama and Georgia on October 10, hit timberland owners and timber markets hard. John Alter and his wife Elizabeth manage more than 1,000 acres in Malone, Florida, including 18 Tree Farm stands. The Alters were honored as Florida’s Outstanding Tree Farmers of the Year in . “This is a true disaster,” said Alter. “My immediate focus is on determining what to do with what’s left of my timber, and I do not have access to everything right now.” Timber damage on John Alter’s land in Florida. The total losses to Florida timber producers and consumers from Hurricane Michael may exceed $1 billion. (Photo by John Alter) The monetary estimate of timber damage in Florida alone is well over $1 billion. The hurricane also caused extensive damage in Georgia and Alabama. Research shows that damage from individual storms and other forest threats, such as insects, fire, and disease, can create widespread wealth redistribution among timber land owners. The entire supply chain is impacted – from landowners to loggers to the mills and beyond. Southern Research Station Forest Economics and Policy researchers Thomas Holmes and Jeff Prestemon’s studies show that growers with damaged stands lose wealth. “Prices fall during the salvage period due to the spike in volume and quality degradation,” said Holmes. “Plus, not all damaged timber can be salvaged.” Timber growers with damaged stands and timber consumers – mills – tend to lose out, he explained. However, timber producers with undamaged stands benefit because wood is still needed, and prices can rise to make up for the lack of high-quality wood available after salvage operations. He predicts that, based on a timber market welfare analysis, the aggregate losses to timber producers and consumers in Florida from Hurricane Michael may exceed the current $1 billion estimate. In the past, state governments have taken steps to assist timber managers with salvage operations. Some examples include relaxing weight limits on roads; allowing logging trucks to carry heavier loads; permitting larger than normal log storage volumes at mills; and assisting private landowners and nongovernmental organizations with salvage planning. “It would take 2.4 million logging trucks to remove all of the dead trees that we have in Florida as a result of this hurricane,” said Florida Forest Service State Forester/Director Jim Karels. The Forest Service is supporting restoration efforts by working closely with state foresters in Florida and Georgia to increase timber sale and salvage operations. At the states’ request, agency specialists will also provide technical assistance to help private landowners write plans for treatments and get their timber to market. The Forest Service will also provide funding to state forestry agencies to administer landowner reforestation programs. “Active cooperation between state and federal agencies will be the key to recovery,” said Rob Doudrick, SRS Director. “Our research will provide the sound science for making decisions.” Using satellite imagery, Southern Research Station scientists are able to see the impacts of Hurricane Michael’s destructive winds and Florence’s drenching rains. The ForWarn tool, which SRS scientists helped develop, reveals impacts before people can view damage on the ground.

"Shawnee National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 31,  The Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom. Youngsters will have an opportunity to enjoy the Shawnee National Forest, like the kids here at the Young Trekkers afterschool program. Photo used with permission. With declining budgets in the public school system, there has been a steady decrease in school fieldtrips in recent years. This plight further widens the disconnect between children and nature. To help bridge the gap between the schoolroom and the natural world, the Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom.  The program will be piloted to third- through fifth-grade students in Union and Alexander counties located in southern Illinois, and will focus on two themes – forest ecology and wetland ecology. Forest Service employees will visit the classroom several times during the semester to cover topics, such as the role of water, the function of wetlands, forest functions, and tree identification, or subjects identified by the teacher.  Naturalist in the Classroom will culminate in a one-day field trip at a Forest Service site with Forest Service natural resource and conservation education professionals to show students how what they learned applies in the field and in national forest management. There will be hands-on activities and games from various national curriculums, such as Project Learning Tree, Project Aquatic Wild and WOW! Wonders of Wetlands will be used. Naturalist in the Classroom aims to strengthen and expand the Shawnee’s environmental education program, get kids outdoors, and assist local educators in meeting Illinois’ learning standards.  Schools benefitting from the program are located in areas with high unemployment and have some of the highest underserved populations in southern Illinois. “We are really excited about implementing this new program in local schools,” said Allen Nicholas, forest supervisor at Shawnee National Forest.  “There are so many barriers to getting children in the outdoors these days.  We hope the Naturalist in the Classroom project will be the bridge in getting kids into the outdoors, as well as connecting them to the expertise of our natural resource professionals.” The spring application deadline is Feb. 5; the fall application deadline is Sept. 5. The Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom.

"Director of Sustainability Development, USDA in  Conservation  Dec 15,  Researchers at USDA Agricultural Research Service help reduce food waste by developing new ways to extend food shelf life and by creating new food products, biobased plastics, and animal feed from food waste. USDA photo by Stephen Ausmus. Less than 2 years ago, the USDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, with the goal of reducing food waste in the United States.  We set an ambitious goal of having at least 400 businesses, schools, and/or organizations join the challenge by letting us know what they are doing to reduce food waste in their operations.  USDA also committed to finding ways in which its 33 agencies and offices could help reduce food waste through policy, partnerships, and research. As of today, we have surpassed our membership goal by signing up 1,313 participants in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge. The number and diversity of participants joining the challenge are indicative of a growing movement to reduce food waste that is spreading across the country. Founding members, Rio Farms, Unilever, General Mills, and the Food Waste Reduction Alliance have been joined by members from across the food supply chain.  Hannaford, a supermarket chain in the Northeast, recently joined the U.S. Food Waste Challenge and shared the many ways in which it keeps food from ending up in landfills.  Using the “food recovery hierarchy,” Hannaford tries to reduce food waste at the source by having fresh products delivered on a daily basis instead of 3-4 times per week.  Daily deliveries lead to more accurate ordering, less food waste, and improvements in quality.  Safeway, another supermarket chain participating in the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, donates the wholesome, edible food that goes unsold in their stores to feed hungry people.  In , Safeway recovered and donated 72 million pounds of food to hunger relief organizations. Other participants in our challenge like K-12 schools, universities, and sports teams are also involved in food recovery and donation activities.  With the help of organizations like Campus Kitchens and Food Recovery Network, over 120 colleges and universities have started food recovery efforts in their dining facilities to donate wholesome unsold food to local food pantries.  Sports teams like the Milwaukee Brewers and movie studios like NBC Universal have also signed up for the challenge because of their work with Rock and Wrap It Up!, an organization that recovers and donates unsold food at sporting events and movie shoots. Moving down the food recovery hierarchy, some participants in our challenge keep food from landfills by converting it to livestock feed.  Four Minnesota schools in the Chisago Lakes School District have their food waste picked up by Barthold Pig Farm, where it is then heated and fed to pigs. The 72 McDonalds’ in Hawaii now sell their used cooking oil to Pacific Biodiesel, where it is then recycled into fuel. Not to be outdone by all of our U.S. Food Waste Challenge participants, the USDA also delivered on reducing food waste through our policies, partnerships, and research.  USDA Economic Research Service (ERS) continues to study and provide estimates on how much food goes uneaten at the retail and consumer level.  The estimated pounds, monetary value, and calories of food loss that USDA ERS helps policymakers, the food industry, and nonprofits better explain the food waste issue to the public, make recommendations, and set targeted goals. Through the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the USDA is researching and developing new products that help 1) reduce food spoilage; 2) reuse waste from food processing to produce new value-added products; and 3) recycle food waste into livestock feed or biobased products such as biodegradable plastics. ARS, for example, helped Gorge Delight, a grower-owned business, develop a 100% fruit bar that uses blemished or damaged apples and pears from their orchards that would have otherwise been discarded.  Not only does ARS’s work help reduce food waste, but it also creates new economic opportunities in rural areas. For consumers and families, USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has updated the “Ask Karen” website, which is visited over 10 million times a year, to answer people’s questions on how to safely handle, prepare, and store food.  FSIS, which is responsible for ensuring that the nation’s commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe and correctly labeled, recently streamlined procedures for donating wholesome misbranded meat and poultry products.  In April , as a result of this directive, FSIS was involved in the donation of approximately 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage.  The misbranded product was donated to the Westmoreland County Food Bank and Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. Finally, here at USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C., the cafeteria, which serves up to 3,000 people a day, has found some innovative ways to reduce food waste.  The dining service company, IL Creations, holds “Happy Hour” from 2:30 pm – 3:00 pm, at which food is sold at a 30% discount to reduce the amount of unsold leftovers.  For people with eyes bigger than their stomachs, USDA has promoted composting and made it easy for employees by placing composting bins all over the building.   In , USDA headquarters composted about 2,650 pounds of food waste per week.  This represents about a 10% increase from , which is double our original goal of a 5% increase. The goal we had for launching the U.S. Food Waste Challenge was to help inspire organizations and individuals across the food supply chain to start reducing, recovering, and recycling food waste in their day-to-day operations.  What we didn’t expect was how much your energy, passion, and support would push us to do more.  Indeed there is so much more work to be done to reduce food waste in America, and we want to continue working on this issue for years to come. USDA FSIS recently changed on donation of mislabeled meat and poultry products. In April , this new directive led to 84,310 pounds of misbranded pork sausage being donated to local food pantries instead of being dumped into a landfill.

"FoodShare Columbia: Another Great Way to Increase Access to Healthy, Affordable Foods with SNAP  March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  FoodShare Columbia is a program designed to help alleviate the stress families face when they live in “food deserts.” The program, in cooperation with the University of South Carolina and other partners, assembles produce food boxes to distribute to low-income individuals. It just got started in April and has already distributed more than 3,000 food boxes in a community with a high rate of diabetes-related health conditions. More than half of these food boxes have been purchased by SNAP recipients using their SNAP EBT cards. The program is proving highly successful and is revolutionizing the way the community addresses food insecurity.

"With USDA Support, A Health Center in Alaska’s Susitna Valley Celebrates a Grand Opening   On a beautiful, bright Sunday in August, members of the Alaska  USDA-Rural Development team met with the leadership of the new Sunshine Community Health Center and other funders to celebrate the grand opening of the new healthcare facility in Willow.  They were joined by members of the surrounding communities which this new clinic will serve, including Willow, Houston and Skwentna, Alaska. The old healthcare building of some 1,400 square feet had grown outdated in both accommodations for staff and residents needing medical services.  The work space to provide private exams and perform much needed medical procedures was too small and no longer met the required protocols. “The new building is a 6,800 square foot facility that houses six new exam rooms, allowing the clinic to expand and supply necessary healthcare expertise and services to the residents of the surrounding service area.  It will provide many new jobs ranging from entry-level support personnel to professional and bring higher levels of medical services,” said Rural Development Alaska State Director Jim Nordlund.

"USDA Food Waste Challenge Team in  Food and Nutrition  Nov 24,  On average, these polts will take 4 to 5 months to make weight. It takes a lot of natural resources, energy, labor, and love to raise the estimated 46 million turkeys that will be consumed this Thanksgiving. Show your appreciation by making sure you waste as little food as possible. Photo courtesy of USDA. Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate all that is good in our lives and to spend it in the company of friends and family while enjoying great food.  It is also a time to reflect on the bounty of our food supply.  Each year, as I put away the leftovers from my Thanksgiving dinner, I marvel at the abundance. I also can’t avoid pausing to consider how much food is wasted in this country. USDA estimates that on average, American consumers waste about one-fifth of food that is available to them, equivalent to about $371 per person annually.  That’s enough money to buy about 21 whole turkeys for each person in the country. Wouldn’t it be great if we could make reducing food waste one of our Thanksgiving traditions?  A tradition we practice throughout the year? Reducing food waste starts with meal planning. Before you start shopping, take stock of what you have in your refrigerator and cupboards so that you don’t end up tossing extras.  A friend of mine uses an “Eat Me First” bin, so that the most perishable items are not lost at the back of the refrigerator. On Thanksgiving, using up the food currently in your refrigerator is particularly important to clear room for all of those Thanksgiving ingredients and post-Thanksgiving leftovers.  Careful menu planning and portion control helps to minimize waste.  When buying a turkey, USDA recommends allowing for one pound of turkey per person. Thanksgiving leftovers can be substantial, particularly when the gatherings are large.  Take time to make sure leftovers are refrigerated within two hours from when they are hot and have guests leave with something tasty to take home and eat later.  Leftovers can be delicious and the reason for gathering once more with friends and family. Many of my friends host Leftover Parties the day after Thanksgiving, which can sometimes spark debate among the partygoers as to whose pecan pie was better.  “The Friday after Thanksgiving is like a de facto National Leftovers Day – it’s the one day of the year where almost everyone enjoys leftovers,” says Jonathan Bloom, a food-waste author and blogger.  Of course, if you don’t have time to party with leftovers, you can simply store them.  Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for three to four days or safely frozen for up to a year. Thanksgiving is the perfect time to begin food waste reduction strategies in your household that can gradually become habit for every day of the year.  No one wants to throw delicious Thanksgiving food into the trash or compost bin, but shouldn’t we treat all food that we eat with the same amount of respect year-round? So here’s a toast to a Happy and Food Waste Free Thanksgiving.

The Wisconsin Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy project was selected March 15 to receive a U.S. Forest Service Wings Across the Americas award for their efforts in wild-bird habitat management. Every year, the Forest Service recognizes outstanding work by partners and local Forest Service employees in conserving habitat for birds, bats and butterflies. This award highlights the outstanding partnership of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Trust for Public Land, and the U.S. Forest Service for work in land stewardship and bird conservation in northwestern Wisconsin. The Chippewa Flowage Forest Legacy Program project links over 18,000 acres of resource-rich forest with nearly one million acres of protected forest lands on either side of the Chippewa Flowage Watershed. The program connects the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal land, protected county forest lands and state protected lands. This property is a critical piece of the forest puzzle in the Chippewa Flowage Watershed, the state’s third largest inland body of water, and a world-class fishery for muskellunge and walleye. A conservation easement on this site ensures continued unrestricted access to this Northwoods jewel. This project is located adjacent to the Upper Chippewa Conifer-Hardwood Forest Important Bird Area -- designated by the Audubon Society for providing essential habitat that contributes to the protection of bird populations and communities, including a heron rookery.  Endangered grey wolves are also known to frequent the property. By permanently protecting important forest habitat surrounding the Chippewa Flowage -- one of Wisconsin’s largest wilderness bodies of water -- important ecological, recreational, social, cultural and economic benefits have been preserved for future generations.

"USDA Research Progress Towards Global Food Security  Most of us living in the United States are fortunate enough not to wonder where our next meal will come from. Yet across the globe, at least some time during the year, nearly 800 million people do. Not having access to stable and nutritious food sources – or food insecurity — negatively impacts people’s lives. Food security, on the other hand, means access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life.

"U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Initiatives  Jun 06,  Forest Service employee, Michaela Hall, rafting on the Middle Fork of the Flathead River adjacent to Glacier National Park in Montana. In an era of social media mania, forests around the country are opening their doors to reacquaint kids and parents with good old fashion family fun—without the aid of modern technology. On Saturday, June 11, the U.S. Forest Service invites families to join thousands of forest explorers for a free, fun-packed day of outdoor adventures in celebration of National Get Outdoors Day. The event also known as “GO Day” is celebrating its ninth anniversary of inspiring national and local organizations to come together to promote the social, economic and environmental benefits of outdoor recreation. Dozens of events on national forests and grasslands will feature opportunities including camping, rock wall climbing, kayaking, biking and archery. Nationwide, more than 100 locations will provide free recreational and educational activities. Some events are specifically designed to better engage urban and multicultural youth in nature-based activities and attract first-time visitors to public lands. In the spirit of GO Day, fees are waived generally for day-use areas, such as picnic grounds, developed trailheads and destination visitor centers. Concessionaire-operated sites may be included in the waiver if the permit holder wishes to participate. Contact your local national forest or grassland to learn if your destination requires a fee or if that fee is waived. National forests provide tremendous settings for spending a day or two in the great outdoors. These public lands provide more than 158,000 miles of recreational trails, wild and scenic rivers, lakes and streams, thousands of campgrounds and day-use sites, and educational opportunities at Forest Service visitor centers. These lands also add more than $13 billion in benefits to local economies. June is Great Outdoors Month, and U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell of the Forest Service invites all Americans to join the Forest Service and its many partner organizations in getting out and exploring all types of recreational activities throughout the month. GO Day is proud to support the First Lady’s Let's Move Outside campaign to eliminate childhood obesity within one generation. The goal is to get kids active so they see the physical activity they need not as a chore, but as a fun way to explore our country. The remaining fee-free days for include National Public Lands Day (Sept. 24) and Veterans Day weekend (Nov. 11-13). Kids playing in a favorite lake.

"Merrigan Meets Main Street in Momence, Illinois  This week, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan toured the Main Street of Momence, Il, to view the positive growth made possible by USDA’s investments in rural revitalization. The community was decorated with corn stalks and fall mums to welcome Agriculture Deputy Secretary Merrigan to this town of 3,200 people, located 50 miles south of Chicago.  Merrigan and Momence residents enthusiastically toured several businesses that received financing thanks to a USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG), administered by the USDA Rural Development agency.  Last year USDA provided a $99,000 grant to “Main Street Momence,” a preservation and volunteer based economic development program, to help them establish a revolving, low-interest loan fund.  The program is designed to help small businesses locate or remain in Momence’s historic downtown area. Thirteen months later, four businesses have taken advantage of the increased access to credit by taking out loans. As a result, these businesses have created 27 new full time jobs and saved another 21 in this past year alone.

"NRCS Washington in  Conservation  Apr 22,  The bright yellow demonstration house built by Earth Team volunteers Mike and Jill Viafore is being used at fairs and exhibits to show how to install a home rain barrel and miniature rain garden. Using these practices, homeowners can save water and protect nearby lakes and streams from pollution.  Mike and Jill Viafore are crafty. This past summer, the couple designed and built a portable demonstration house to educate the public about the benefits of rain barrels and rain gardens at exhibits and fairs. But the Viafores didn’t put this exhibit together just for fun—they are contributing their crafty skills as Earth Team volunteers. Earth Team is the name given to USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service volunteers. Earth Team volunteers work side by side with Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) employees on conservation projects to improve their local environment. The NRCS Pierce Conservation District Stream Team uses the shed-sized structure the Viafores built as a conservation education tool in the Seattle, Wash., area. With the easily transported house, Stream Team volunteers can now show people ways they can minimize the impact of stormwater on local streams using rain barrels and rain gardens. Rain barrels take rainwater from roofs and divert it into a barrel. The captured water can then be used to water gardens and landscapes during dryer periods. Rain gardens are attractive landscape features that take stormwater from roofs and other impervious surfaces and filters pollutants out as the water percolates down through the soil into the groundwater to help recharge aquifers. Stream Team personnel say the Viafore–built house allows them to better demonstrate the importance of using conservation practices to protect local streams, lakes and the nearby Pacific Ocean. Earth Team volunteers Jill and Mike Viafore stand in front of a portable demonstration house they built in Washington State.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  Nov 13,  Animal Care inspector Bob Markmann conducts an inspection at a commercial dog breeding facility. USDA/APHIS’ Animal Care program enforces the federal Animal Welfare Act, which sets standards for humane care and treatment that must be provided for certain animals that are exhibited to the public, bred for commercial sale, used in biomedical research, or transported commercially. Individuals/entities that operate facilities using animals in these ways must provide their animals with proper veterinary care, adequate housing, appropriate nutrition, etc. In Bob Markmann’s own words: “Our job can be smelly at times. I’ve been urinated on by a tiger while inspecting a circus. I’ve been sneezed on by an elephant. I’ve had a chimpanzee throw feces at me. And too often, I come home smelling like guinea pigs and dogs. But the worst was when I came home smelling like a prehensile-tailed porcupine. That smell takes the cake. I have not found a good way to describe it.” Hazards of the trade, no doubt. But a small price to pay to make a difference in the lives of thousands upon thousands of animals each year. Animal Care’s veterinary medical officers and animal care inspectors cover a particular geographic area across the country. They inspect animals and facilities licensed and registered with USDA under the Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act. These dedicated souls spend a lot of time on the road, driving from facility to facility. Their duties include: observing animals for signs of poor health, abuse, or any kind of mistreatment or inadequate care; determining if animal enclosures are appropriate for the species and will not cause harm to the animals; inspecting horses at horse shows, auctions and sales; responding to complaints at USDA-licensed facilities; interviewing suspected unlicensed operators to determine if they need a license; and educating licensees and license applicants on the proper procedures in the humane care, handling and transportation of animals. It’s a varied job description indeed. And it’s that daily variety, along with an innate desire for the welfare of the animals they regulate, which led these individuals to become APHIS inspectors. Asked why they chose this career, here’s what a few of them had to say. Veterinary medical officer Gloria McFadden conducts an inspection at a research facility.  “I became an inspector to make a difference for animals. Over my 22 years with Animal Care, I have found that, although we can’t help them all, we do make a big difference in the lives of the ones we can help.” - Elizabeth Pannill, veterinary medical officer, Texas “Previously, I had worked four years in private practice and four years for the Food Safety Inspection Service in a chicken plant in North Carolina. I applied for a position with Animal Care in South Carolina and was hired 19 years ago. We have made a lot of really good changes over the decades, especially in our training and our consistency. In the beginning, I had a licensee who was literally starving his cougars before my eyes, but all I could do was cite him. Today, we would have those cougars confiscated and taken to a better place.” - Lisa MacElderry, veterinary medical officer, South Carolina “I’ve been with APHIS more than 25 years. I’ve always been interested in animal welfare, and joined the agency hoping to make a difference.” - Bob Markmann, animal care inspector, Pennsylvania  “I’ve been with Animal Care since Dec. 30, . My purpose then is the same as it is today: to provide better environments for animals by helping their owners understand the importance of proper care. I wanted to be a part of an organization that would be searching for and utilizing new scientific approaches to improve the environment and care of the animals that are listed under the Animal Welfare Act.” - Nancy Ellifrit, veterinary medical officer, Oklahoma  Category/Topic:  Animals  Plants  Tags:  Animal Care  Animal Welfare Act  APHIS  Horse Protection Act  Pennsylvania  Plant and Animal Health  South Carolina  Texas","What are some of the key responsibilities and hazards faced by USDA/APHIS' Animal Care inspectors, such as Bob Markmann, who inspect animals and facilities licensed under the Animal Welfare Act?","USDA/APHIS' Animal Care inspectors, like Bob Markmann, have key responsibilities including observing animals for signs of poor health or mistreatment, ensuring animal enclosures are suitable, inspecting horses at events, responding to complaints, interviewing suspected unlicensed operators, and educating licensees on humane care.

"Arizona USDA Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Sep 16,   The folks in the small community of Taylor, Arizona, have a reputation for creative problem solving. Back in the late ’s local blacksmith Joseph Hancock came up with an ingenious solution for celebrating the Fourth of July in the tiny town. The tradition then was for towns to fire their cannons to celebrate Independence Day. But the Town of Taylor was without a cannon. So Hancock offered up two historic anvils and the tradition of “firing the anvil” became an annual event for the town. At dawn every Fourth of July, the Jennings Band members climb onto a flatbed truck and ride up and down the neighborhoods in Taylor, stopping on street corners while the anvil is fired and patriotic music is played for the sleepy residents. Decades after Joseph Hancock donated his anvils, descendents of those first settlers continue to farm and ranch in the fertile valley on the Silver Creek. One family, the Salines, have a ranching operation located just outside Taylor. As a young boy Alma Saline would be up early milking cows, fixing fences and harvesting crops. It’s what the family had to do to keep their -acre farm/ranch running. Silver Creek Farms is in the Little Colorado River Basin in northeastern Arizona. It was homesteaded by Alma’s grandfather around . About 400 acres of the ranch is in alfalfa hay, silage corn and a little bit of sweet corn and sunflowers. They have black Angus cows pastured in the river bottom and the open range land that spreads across the high plateau.It’s an idyllic life…but not an easy one. When Alma’s father died in he left the ranch to his family as a trust. Alma assumed the responsibility of managing the assets and the day-to-day operation of the farm. “Much of the equipment that Dad left was old,” Alma says. “We had just a minimum of cattle and only 70 acres in crop production.” For the past 11 years, Alma and his family have been building the ranch back into a higher production operation. They now irrigate 230 acres with two center pivots and have an 80 acre field where all waste water is recycled back into the irrigation system. Another 100 acres is irrigated with water from the Silver Creek Irrigation district. In the family drilled an irrigation well, which irrigates about 300 acres. The well requires about 155,00kW of electricity per year to operate.The cost of the electricity to run the well is the single largest expense on the farm. Alma and his family had considered alternative energy sources, but the 54KW per hour requirement was too large for a solar-powered system that would be within their budget. Two years ago, in the old tradition of Taylor creative problem solving, the Saline’s neighbors at the Elkins Ranch put in wind-turbines to generate electricity. Alma and his family were intrigued. Today, thanks in part to a $53,000 Renewable Energy for America Program grant from USDA Rural Development, the Salines have installed a 155,000kW Vestus V-19 wind turbine. The unit is expected to generate all of the electricity needed to run the well…and maybe a little extra to hedge against the rising cost of electricity. The ranch has a contract with the local utility company to “net meter”—feed power into the utility grid during production months and use power as needed in the off-wind summer months. “At the end of each year, we’ll settle the differences,” explained Alma. Today it’s not just flying anvils that punctuate the Taylor skies. Turbines are taking a spin there too.

"APHIS Associate Deputy Administrator, International Services in  Animals  Plants  Nov 13,  Peace Corps Volunteers receiving training on screwworm surveillance program from APHIS employees in Panama. Over the past few months, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), as part of the U.S. Panama Commission for Eradication of Screwworm, has started to partner with Peace Corps Volunteers in Panama to enhance APHIS’ surveillance activities. Volunteers will be working in rural Panama and meeting with local communities to raise awareness about as well as report suspected cases of New World screwworm, one of the most costly and economically significant pests of livestock in South America. The New World screwworm is a parasite of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Female screwworms are attracted to and lay their eggs in exposed flesh wounds.  After eggs hatch, larvae burrow and feed on flesh, causing severe tissue damage and may even be lethal to the host. The screwworm was eradicated from the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao and, finally, all of Central America in using the Sterile Insect Technique in which sterile male flies are released in massive numbers to mate with wild female populations. The mated female flies then lay non-viable eggs, leading to a decrease and subsequent eradication of screwworm populations. To prevent the screwworm from spreading north of South America, The Commission is maintaining a barrier at the Darien Gap between Panama and Colombia, by utilizing both preventive release of sterile flies and field surveillance. Effective surveillance is crucial to maintaining the screwworm barrier. Beyond Peace Corps Volunteers, U.S. Panama Commission for Eradication of Screwworm relies on field staff and an estimated 552 honorary volunteer inspectors, composed of farmers and private veterinarians to stay on the lookout for suspected cases of screwworm.  There is a constant threat of screwworm reintroduction beyond the Darien Gap from Columbia, where the pest is still present and the migration of people, domesticated animals, and cattle pose a risk. Because most of the Darien Gap and rural areas in Eastern Panama are not easily accessible, APHIS enlisted Peace Corps volunteers, who are already trained and skilled at working with rural communities, to assist with the screwworm surveillance program and reach out to local communities and their officials to explain the risk this pest poses to both people and livestock. “Not only are we creating opportunities for Peace Corps Volunteers who have an interest in agricultural work, it’s an opportunity for APHIS to enhance our screwworm surveillance,” said Deputy Administrator of International Services, Beverly Simmons, who oversees all international action programs, including screwworm.

"US Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 23,  Members of the Highway 89 Stewardship Team ceremonially broke ground in early May to begin construction on two wildlife underpasses in northeast California. Photo credit: Sagehen Creek Field Station Every year in the U.S. roughly 200 people are killed in as many as 2 million wildlife-vehicle collisions and at a cost of more than $8 billion, according to the Western Transportation Institute. But the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Research Station scientists, along with their collaborators in the Highway 89 Stewardship Team, are paving the way to reduce those statistics with their latest project. The team broke ground last May on its second and third wildlife underpasses along a 25-mile stretch of Highway 89 between Truckee and Sierraville, California. “Studies have shown that well-placed wildlife crossings, coupled with fencing, can reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions by as much as 75 to 100 percent,” said Sandra Jacobson, a wildlife biologist with Pacific Southwest Research Station. While wildlife crossings exist across the country, the Highway 89 crossings will be unique in their value to science. Built to near identical dimensions and only located a mile apart from each other, the underpasses will allow scientists to manipulate conditions to learn what might make an underpass more appealing to wildlife. For instance there might be things that cancel out noise or add cover within the tunnels that might promote use among smaller animals. The tunnels are adjacent to the University of California, Berkeley’s Sagehen Creek Field Station in the Sagehen Experimental Forest, which will give scientists access to the forest’s research facilities and monitoring equipment. The $2.8 million project was funded largely in part by a Federal Highways Transportation Enhancement grant. The underpasses should be completed and operational by the fall.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:USDA Office of Communications 720-  LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 17, - This week, following the recent announcement of $2 million in Conservation Innovation Grants to support water quality trading markets, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hosted a joint workshop to expand markets for water quality benefits generated on farms, ranches and forest lands.Water quality trading is an innovative approach to reduce pollution and efficiently achieve water quality goals. Trading is based on the fact that sources in a watershed can face very different costs to control the same pollutant. Trading programs allow facilities facing higher pollution control costs to meet their regulatory obligations by purchasing environmentally equivalent (or superior) pollution reductions from another source at lower cost, thus achieving the same water quality improvement at lower overall cost.USDA and EPA signed a partnership agreement in to advance water quality trading and other market-based approaches that provide benefits to the environment and economy. The workshop attracted over 200 participants involved in water quality trading from across the nation.""Conservation practices that improve soil health and conserve nutrients also produce real water quality benefits. With support from USDA and our Federal partners, water quality markets can create incentives to increase these environmental benefits and boost investment in rural America. The actions we are announcing today will help us get there,"" said Ann Mills, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment.Among the new water quality trading resources announced:EPA-USDA Water Quality Trading Roadmap The Water Quality Trading Roadmap is a decision support tool for those designing and participating in water quality trading programs. The Roadmap is a searchable database that consolidates policy guidance from EPA, information from State programs, and examples and supporting materials from across the U.S.EPA-USDA partnership on EnviroAtlas to support environmental markets USDA and EPA will incorporate environmental markets layers into the Federal ecosystem service decision support tool, EnviroAtlas. The layers will show where markets for water, carbon, wetlands, and habitats occur on the U.S. landscape, provide information about these markets, and allow this information to be displayed in the context of existing environmental from Federal agencies.Nutrient Tracking Tool (NTT) USDA will release this fall the next version of NTT, ready for use in the Pacific Northwest and Ohio River Basin. The new version of NTT is a USDA hosted, user-friendly, web-based tool that calculates edge of field nutrient and sediment loads for use in conservation planning and environmental market credit calculation. NTT will be made available in additional regions in .USDA Environmental Markets Website USDA released the Department-level environmental markets website. The site integrates information, tools and resources on environmental markets from across the Department, allowing users to easily gain a snapshot of environmental market activities at USDA.These new resources were announced days after the Natural Resources Conservation Service awarded over $2 million in Conservation Innovation Grants to support water quality trading markets.

This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio. An award-winning watershed assessment tool, the Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA), was deployed to assess potential Rim Fire threats in Yosemite National Park in California.  The park experienced a devastating fire that began on August 17, , and took several months to contain. The fire burned more than 400 square miles in and around the park, cost $125.8 million to date, and is considered one of the largest wildfires in California’s history. BAER (Burned Area Emergency Response) is a multi-agency group that includes USDA’s Forest Service and others, and is responsible for identifying potential threats such as downstream flooding and developing plans to rehabilitate and restore burned areas. BAER teams use AGWA to target immediate efforts to prevent threats to people, wildlife and the land.  Using AGWA combined with the burn severity map produced by BAER teams, experts can rapidly pull together information on pre- and post-fire conditions. For example, knowing where to apply mulch after a fire can reduce runoff and erosion and can help minimize downstream risks from fire induced land cover and soil changes. AGWA has already been successfully used for post-fire BAER team watershed assessments following fires in Arizona, New Mexico, California, Idaho and Washington.  AGWA was jointly developed by scientists with the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Southwest Watershed Research Center in Tucson, AZ, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Universities of Arizona and Wyoming. ARS researchers and their partners originally developed the computer model as a multipurpose computer system and software tool designed for managing and analyzing water quantity and quality to help keep our Nation’s watersheds cleaner. AGWA uses nationally available sources to rapidly establish and execute results from two ARS-developed watershed models, the Kinematic Runoff and Erosion Model (KINEROS2) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT).  It enables the user to visualize and compare model results to understand the impact of a certain practice on a given landscape. How we manage activities that take place on crop production areas, rangelands, pastures, forests, meadows, and urban areas influences the quantity and quality of water available for domestic, industrial, agricultural and ecological uses.

"Historic Investment Will Support Entire Local Food Supply Chain  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .14  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, May 8, – Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced that USDA is making a historic $78 million investment in local and regional food systems, including food hubs, farmers markets, aggregation and processing facilities, distribution services, and other local food business enterprises.""The Farm Bill has given USDA new tools, resources and authority to support the rural economy,"" Vilsack said. ""Consumer demand for locally-produced food is strong and growing, and farmers and ranchers are positioning their businesses to meet that demand. As this sector continues to mature, we see aggregation, processing, and distribution enterprises across the local food supply chain growing rapidly. These historic USDA investments in support of local food give farmers and ranchers more market opportunities, provide consumers with more choices, and create jobs in both rural and urban communities.""Vilsack said that $48 million in loan guarantees for local food projects is now available through USDA 's Rural Development's Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan Program, and $30 million is available through competitive grants via the Agricultural Marketing Service's (AMS) Farmers Market and Local Foods Promotion Program.The Farm Bill requires USDA to set aside at least five percent of Business and Industry (B&I) program loan guarantees for projects that focus on local food business enterprises. Details on how to apply for local food funding through the B&I program are available on the Rural Development website. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. The B&I program has the authority to fund local food infrastructure in urban areas as long as the project supports farm and ranch income and expands healthy food access in underserved communities.Rural Development's B&I program provides financial backing for rural business development in partnership with private-sector lenders. It is one of several USDA programs that help finance local foods projects. In , Rural Development supported more than 170 local food infrastructure projects – from food hubs, to scale-appropriate processing facilities, to cold storage and distribution networks. Entities eligible for B&I loan guarantees include cooperatives, non-profit organizations, corporations, partnerships or other legal entities, Indian tribes, public bodies or individuals.The Farm Bill tripled funding for marketing and promotion support for local food enterprises by creating the Farmers Market and Local Foods Promotion Program, administered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). This new program makes $30 million available annually to farmers markets, other direct producer-to-consumer venues, and other businesses in the local food supply chain. Under this program, $15 million is now available for marketing and promotional support specifically for local food businesses, including food hubs, delivery and aggregation businesses, and processing and storage facilities along the local food supply chain, while $15 million is for marketing support for farmers markets and other direct to consumer outlets. Since , AMS, which administers this program, has funded nearly 450 projects totaling $27 million to support direct marketing efforts for local food.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 12,  Warm Fire, . Over the last three decades, fire season lengths have increased by 60-80 days and annual acreages burned have more than doubled to over 7 million acres annually. In addition, growing housing development in forests has put more people and houses in harms’ way, also making firefighting efforts more expensive. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service, Southwestern Region, Kaibab National Forest. Forests significantly contribute to our quality of life, but climate change is adversely affecting natural resources in rural and urban areas across the U.S. A new report released by the White House, the National Climate Assessment, explores many related issues including how a warming planet affects our forests. With contributions from U.S. Forest Service scientists, the report is one of the most comprehensive examinations of climate change and its effects on forested land. It concludes that a warming climate will complicate future management of public, private and tribal forests. “Climate change is currently triggering multiple, sometimes contrasting, responses from our forests,” said Dave Cleaves, U.S. Forest Service Climate Change Advisor. “Longer growing seasons and gradually warming temperatures are helping trees grow faster in some areas, but in other areas, these longer and warmer growing seasons increase late summer moisture stress and reduce tree growth.” The Forest Service integrates climate change awareness, mitigation and adaptation into the management of its 193 million acres through the Climate Change Performance Scorecard.  For example, this tool has encouraged national forests to identify vulnerable water resources, plant more climate-resilient tree species, research carbon storage capacity and more. Some of the other ways the Forest Service manages wildlands includes reducing the potential for large crown fires expected in a warmer climate by removing hazardous fuels and managing for lower stem densities in dry forests, managing forest genetic diversity to increase resilience to a warmer climate and restoring riparian areas adjacent to streams to ensure cold-water fish habitat during summer low-flow periods. Public and private forests in the U.S. will increasingly be vulnerable to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought and disease outbreaks. At the same time, the need for healthy forests will only continue to increase. Forests provide an expanding opportunity to support emerging bioenergy markets and carbon credit systems. It is likely such uses will interact with the demand for wood products, healthy watersheds and recreational opportunities. There will also be continued economic pressures encouraging a shift from forestland to agricultural or urban land uses. According to Linda Joyce, a Forest Service scientist, and one of the authors of the report, climate-smart management practices are being developed and implemented, and the agency is maintaining its focus on retaining forests as forests restoring forest health and resilience, and reforesting private and federal lands. However, Joyce emphasized that implementation of climate-smart management practices can be increased only through effective integration of scientific information in management of our national wildlands.

Private landowners can also adopt these strategies, as well as others such as: 1. Developing and implementing climate-smart management practices. 2. Creating carbon credit systems that support reforestation and afforestation efforts. 3. Partnering with government agencies to access funding and expertise for forest conservation and restoration projects. 4. Investing in research and development of new technologies that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change on forests. By implementing these strategies, both the U.S. Forest Service and private landowners can work together to maintain forest health and resilience while also supporting emerging bioenergy markets and carbon credit systems."
"A collaborative agreement for use of NOAA satellites will help the Interior and Agriculture Departments detect wildfires early, track wildfires in real time, and provide for public safety and air quality modeling  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .24  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, July 23, — The Biden-Harris administration today announced it is taking additional steps to safeguard western communities in the face of increasingly dangerous and intense wildland fires by building advanced wildfire detection capabilities using satellite technology. The Department of the Interior and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s Forest Service have signed an agreement with the Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to use the NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite — R series (GOES-R) to rapidly detect and report wildfire starts. Supported by a $20 million investment from the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—$10 million each from Interior and Agriculture— this new agreement will use advanced remote sensing capabilities to improve the speed and accuracy of wildfire detection. President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, is bringing much-needed assistance to communities across the country — deploying innovative tools to tackle wildfires, increasing the resilience of lands facing the threat of wildland fires, and better supporting federal wildland firefighters. The law includes $5 billion for these Departments over five years to invest in preparedness, fuels management, post-fire restoration, and fire science. “This partnership is one of the many ways we are investing in technology to improve firefighter and community safety,” said Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. “Wildland firefighting will always require highly skilled individuals working on the ground, but with more real-time information we can reduce the risks to crews and pilots, and improve our response time, reducing the risk to impacted communities.” “This collaborative effort demonstrates how the federal government is deploying resources from President Biden’s historic Investing in America agenda to improve its emergency response capabilities and address increasingly frequent and extreme climate-driven wildfires,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland. “By using expanded satellite capacity to pinpoint wildfire ignitions and provide real-time for wildfire managers, this partnership with NOAA will enable the Interior and Agriculture Departments to respond to wildfires more rapidly and make informed decisions for firefighting operations and public safety.” “Now more than ever, the impacts of climate change are increasing the threat of wildfires across the country and thanks to President Biden’s commitment to investing in America, NOAA has been able to significantly improve fire weather forecasts to keep communities safe,” said Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. “This new partnership, a result of the most ambitious climate agenda in history, will help expand our ability to detect wildfires, improve response times, and keep families in western communities out of harm’s way.” Use of NOAA’s GOES-R satellite will enable the Interior and Agriculture Departments to detect wildfires early, provide firefighters a more detailed look at wildfire conditions, allow faster hot spot detection, and provide the ability to track wildfire progression in real time. GOES-R series satellites are frequently capable of detecting wildfires before they are spotted on the ground or reported to 911. The satellites can also be used to pinpoint the exact location of a fire after smoke occur. These improved capabilities will support interagency efforts to protect people and communities from increasingly devastating wildfires. GOES-R satellite observations are not only valuable for detecting wildfires but are also critical for observing and monitoring smoke from those fires. The ability to monitor smoke plumes in near real time is particularly useful in directing firefighting efforts from the air. Deploying airplanes and helicopters for wildfire suppression efforts is often hampered by poor visibility. GOES-R satellites can help guide decisions for deploying flights by providing information on the exact location and drift of smoke from a fire. The smoke detection and monitoring information also enable better air quality forecasts to help safeguard public health. These improvements help equip communities with the information they need to assess risks and develop climate solutions—a key objective of the National Climate Resilience Framework. Today’s effort supports recommendations by the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, which was established through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and charged with making recommendations to improve federal policies related to the mitigation, suppression, and management of wildland fires in the United States. In September , the Commission released a comprehensive report (, 5.3 ) to Congress outlining 148 recommendations to improve the nation’s relationship with wildfire. This collaboration advances recommendations for expanded use of wildfire detection systems and improved collaboration across organizations and jurisdictions. # USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.","What advanced satellite technology will be used by the Interior and Agriculture Departments in partnership with NOAA to detect wildfires early, track their progression in real-time, and provide critical information for public safety and air quality modeling?","The NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite — R series (GOES-R) will be used by the Interior and Agriculture Departments in partnership with NOAA to detect wildfires early, track their progression in real-time, and provide critical information for public safety and air quality modeling."

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. 0204.19  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@oc.usda.gov  FLANDREAU, S.D., Dec. 12, 2019 – Today, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development South Dakota State Director Julie Gross announced USDA has invested $9.5 million in high-speed broadband infrastructure that will create or improve e-Connectivity for more than 1,750 homes in rural South Dakota. This is one of many funding announcements in the first round of USDA’s ReConnect Pilot Program investments. “Reliable, high-speed broadband internet e-Connectivity is essential to increasing access to specialized health care and education, connecting with friends and family, building or starting a business, or increasing productivity at your agricultural operation,” Gross said. “Under the leadership of President Trump and Agriculture Secretary Perdue, USDA is committed to being a strong partner in deploying this essential infrastructure in rural communities, because when rural America thrives, all of America thrives.” Valley Telecommunications Cooperative will use $9.5 million in ReConnect grant funding to deploy a fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network in Brookings, Kingsbury and Moody counties in South Dakota. This investment is anticipated to reach 1,750 rural households, 27 farms, 17 businesses and one critical community facility. Background: In March 2018, Congress provided $600 million to USDA to expand broadband infrastructure and services in rural America. On Dec. 13, 2018, Secretary Perdue announced the rules of the program, called “ReConnect,” including how the loans and grants will be awarded to help build broadband infrastructure in rural America. USDA received 146 applications between May 31, 2019, and July 12, 2019, requesting $1.4 billion in funding across all three ReConnect Program funding products: 100 percent loan, 100 percent grant, and loan-grant combinations. USDA is reviewing applications and announcing approved projects on a rolling basis. Additional investments in all three categories will be made in the coming weeks. These grants, loans and combination funds enable the federal government to partner with the private sector and rural communities to build modern broadband infrastructure in areas with insufficient internet service. Insufficient service is defined as connection speeds of less than 10 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 1 Mbps upload. In April 2017, President Donald J. Trump established the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity to identify legislative, regulatory and policy changes that could promote agriculture and prosperity in rural communities. In January 2018, Secretary Perdue presented the Task Force’s findings to President Trump. These findings included 31 recommendations to align the federal government with state, local and tribal governments to take advantage of opportunities that exist in rural America. Increasing investments in rural infrastructure is a key recommendation of the task force.

Photo by Annie Ceccarini, USDA. All summer, visitors to the National Capitol Region have been seeing monuments, public buildings, works of art and experiencing music and theater; however, many were unexpectedly surprised by the brilliant hues of purple, red and green emanating from USDA’s People’s Garden. But those didn’t just pop up on their own. USDA has a cadre of friendly and knowledgeable employee volunteers who plant, maintain and harvest as well as interact and answer questions from hundreds of people who stop by to admire the garden. “People need to have a connection to their food, like I did when I was growing up,” said Lee Cliburn, who works for the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) - the agency that manages the People’s Garden. Cliburn is one of several USDA Master Gardeners who harvests vegetables on Tuesdays and Fridays. “My grandmother was a talented and skillful gardener, and I learned from her.” Many of the homegrown and overseas folks who stop by the organic vegetable garden at the intersection of Jefferson Drive and 12th Street, SW (northeast corner of USDA Headquarters property) have previously gardened or currently have a garden at home. Some have never experienced the joy and satisfaction of growing anything. “Kids visit us, see the garden and the projects we’re working on, and ask questions. This is an important project because it reconnects USDA with the people it serves and gets them thinking about their food,” said Cliburn. Yet, this People’s Garden provides much more than a learning environment for tourists and spectators. Each week, hundreds of pounds of vegetables and herbs are harvested and donated to DC Central Kitchen (DCCK), where it is prepared and provided to folks who need help putting food on their tables. “They’re so appreciative,” said Tanya Brown, who works for the Farm Service Agency and drives the produce to DCCK. “They get green food, healthy food and herbs like basil and sage.  When I walk in they all say ‘Here comes the herb lady.’” DCCK provides 5,000 meals to 100 homeless shelters, transitional homes and nonprofit organizations throughout The District. Brown said the donated vegetables are used to help prepare some of these meals and when DCCK makes its menu, they say it comes from the People’s Garden. By the simple act of planting a garden and having volunteers care for it has provided an outlet that not only educates the community but provides a solution to hunger. “Having the benefit of fresh vegetables and the experience of gardening encourages me to promote this basic human right for everyone,” said Effie Baldwin, who works for the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and also harvests vegetables on Tuesdays and Fridays. “Spending time in USDA’s People’s Garden not only provides a service but brings back memories of Midwestern summer days spent in my grandparent’s backyard garden.” That’s the sentiment of many USDA Executive Master Gardeners who volunteer with the People’s Garden. Whether it’s listening to a visitor’s gardening woes, answering questions about a vegetable or plant, or donating food to feed the homeless, gardening is more than just food — it’s a labor of love. Want to volunteer at your local People’s Garden? You can find a People’s Garden in your neighborhood on our interactive map. There are 2,116 gardens – located in all 50 states, three U.S. territories and twelve foreign countries – registered as People’s Garden.

"Public Information Coordinator, Mississippi Rural Development in  Rural  May 03,   U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined Obama Administration Cabinet members Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, as well as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills, and other state and local officials to tour areas in Alabama and Mississippi affected by last week’s tornadoes. After visiting devastated sites in Birmingham and nearby areas, the group crossed over to Mississippi, where they surveyed the damage done to Smithville, a town of approximately that was almost literally wiped off the map. In Smithville, Miss. the senior administration officials were joined by Mississippi’s USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George, who had made the trek from her home in central Mississippi in the pre-dawn hours on Thursday, the day after the tornado hit. State Director George viewed damaged areas in Maben, Amory, and parts of Chickasaw County on Thursday. She had monitored the tornado, keeping in contact with local officials as the tornado went through Mississippi on Wednesday. She linked up on Thursday morning with local USDA personnel in Oktibbeha County, arriving only hours after the tornado had passed through. She also toured damaged areas in Neshoba and Kemper Counties that afternoon. Secretary Tom Vilsack toured the area of Smithville, Mississippi and saw firsthand the heavy damage caused by the tornado. He is seen in this photo talking to one of the victims of the disastrous weather. Behind him is USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George of Mississippi. Secretary Vilsack and State Director George were two of a number of Obama Administration Cabinet officials, federal administrators, and local leaders to see the damage caused by tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama. “It is heartbreaking to see this damage and to talk to the people who are victims of the tornado,” said George. “I was able to not only see the physical damages, but I was able to listen to some of the actual victims, many of whom had lost everything. However, I can report that USDA Rural Development has programs that can offer some relief to these unfortunate victims.” George cited USDA Rural Development programs such as funding to replace and repair single-family homes, shared community facilities and the water and wastewater systems in the damaged areas. “I want to make sure that people know about the availability of our programs, especially our single-family home loan and home repair loan programs, so that they can rebuild their homes and businesses and continue to have clean water.” George has a history of fast action on disaster relief. Most recently, she was on the scene the day after tornadoes ran thru Holmes and Yazoo Counties in and made sure that USDA Rural Development programs were a part of both the immediate and long-term relief efforts in those counties. Local officials in both counties credited George and USDA Rural Development for their fast work in making resources available, especially to the homeowners who lost their homes in that disaster. “These people have lost everything but their spirit. For them to see the highest officials in our nation’s government, including Cabinet secretaries and head of relief agencies coming to what is left of their town to see the damage personally,” Said George, “I can’t convey to ya’ll how uplifting that is to those people.

With the new People’s Garden database, gardeners can now itemize the amount and type of fruits and vegetables picked from their People’s Garden. Each product is automatically converted to cups using SuperTracker, which helps gardeners better understand how their yield will feed them and others. For the experienced gardeners who want to explore selling their produce, the new People’s Garden map connects them to nearby farmers markets and CSAs. And that’s not all. Another exciting addition is the Plant a Window Box for Pollinators online game that has been a big hit at the White House Easter Egg Roll, created in cooperation with the Pollinator Partnership. It’s a fun, interactive tool that shows you how planting native species can increase the quality and amount of food available to neighborhood bees and other pollinators. Check it out. Once you lay the groundwork and get growing, don’t forget to register your food, wildlife, conservation, beautification, education, or training garden with us as a People’s Garden.

"South Carolina Agriculture – Nothing Could Be Finer  The Census of Agriculture is the most complete account of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. Every Thursday USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will highlight new Census and the power of the information to shape the future of American agriculture. Agriculture in South Carolina is a long and proud tradition. As the Census of Agriculture showed us, even today, nearly 5 million acres of our state’s land is dedicated to farming, that’s almost a quarter of all land in South Carolina. The latest agriculture census also showed that the number of farms in South Carolina has remained steady for the past 15 years at roughly 25,000. The Palmetto State farmers sold more than $3 billion worth of agricultural products. That’s a whopping 29.2 percent increase in sales in just five years. Of these sales, $1.5 billion – nearly half of the total agricultural product sales in South Carolina – came from poultry and egg sales.

"Utah State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Nov 01, 2019  Nearly 6 percent of farms in Utah have solar panels. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, Utah had more than 18,400 farms encompassing more than 10.8 million acres. This is an increase of 2 percent in the number of farms and a decrease of 1 percent in total acres compared to the 2012 Census of Agriculture. Just under 80 percent of Utah’s farmland is permanent pasture and rangeland –– but a significant amount is cropland, of which most is irrigated. The total value of agricultural sales is $1.84 billion, of which 31 percent are from crop sales and 69 percent are from livestock and their products! The top crops by value of sales are hay and other crops at over $275 million, nursery at over $135 million, and grains and oilseeds at more than $90 million. Cattle sales of about $380 million, milk at $355 million, and hogs around $230 million round out the top three livestock items by value of sales. Utah is the second largest producer of tart cherries in the country! A majority of the 8,419 fruit acres in the state are devoted to tart cherries (4,732 acres), followed by peaches (1,582 acres), and apples (1,211 acres). While not a state with a lot of vegetable acreage, Utah’s top three vegetables are dry onions (1,616 acres), pumpkins (1,415 acres), and sweet corn (1,075 acres). The number of farms with renewable energy systems more than doubled since the 2012 Census of Agriculture. The increase was seen in the number of farms with solar panel arrays at 1,081 up from 425 in 2012 and geothermal systems at 115 farms up from 40 in 2012.

"Adapting to Climate Change and Drought Risk  Economists working on climate change spend a lot of time trying to predict how farmers are going to adapt.  Without knowing how farmers will react to higher average temperatures or different rainfall patterns, we cannot accurately say what climate change will mean for the future.  Farmers have many adaptation options available.  They can change the mix of crops they grow, as well as their production practices, and production might be redistributed across regions.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Nov 06,  Sliced sweet potatoes. Photo credit: Getty Images Sweet potatoes, which are native to the Americas, sustained our founding pioneers with beneficial nutrients like beta carotene, calcium, fiber, and a host of vitamins. No wonder it’s a holiday favorite, especially during Thanksgiving. But what makes a good sweet potato? USDA scientists know what it takes to make a good sweet potato, whether you like it in pies and custards, baked, as chips or French fries, and even juice or smoothies. Together, researchers with the Sweetpotato Breeding Program at North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the USDA-Agricultural Research Service (ARS) develop sweet potato varieties for improved color, flavor and texture—testing them for sugar, starch, beta carotene, anthocyanins and other characteristics that appeal to consumers’ appetites. “Different sweet potato varieties with different flesh color—white, yellow, orange, and purple—are available around the world,” says Van-Den Truong, research leader at the ARS Food Science Research Unit (FSRU) in North Carolina. “But for American consumers, a good sweet potato should have a deep-orange flesh color, a good shape and size with the common skin color of light to medium rose, copper, or red. It also should have good sweetness, flavor, and moist texture.” Truong provides a wealth of information about sweet potato production, different varieties, genetics, storage, packing for fresh root markets, and technologies for processing into consumer food products and functional food ingredients for the food industry in his chapter in the recently published Handbook of Vegetables and Vegetable Processing, 2nd Edition. The chapter also details the nutritional quality of raw sweet potatoes and the processed products. ARS scientists work closely with NCSU researchers, developing new varieties for commercial production that have high yields and nutritional value; are more disease and insect resistant; and can be stored for longer periods for fresh root markets and the food processing industry. Additional research involves testing new varieties for consumer preference. FSRU food technologist Suzanne Johanningsmeier recently showed the high potential for consumer acceptance of Evangeline, a new sweet potato variety, because of its intense orange color, flavor, and moist texture. “It came as no surprise that consumers preferred both Covington and Evangeline sweet potato varieties oven baked compared to cooking in the microwave due to more sweetness and flavor development and softer textures,” Johanningsmeier says. “We always focus on what the American consumers would like,” Truong says. “We target the orange flesh color, which is very rich in beta carotene.” Sweetness—increasing the sugar content—and texture also are important traits. ARS scientists are also evaluating purple-fleshed sweet potato varieties with high anthocyanins and antioxidants for home cooking and processed foods as well as natural colorants. Desired sweet potato characteristics vary somewhat depending on how they’re prepared. For making pies, scientists develop varieties that make a good puree—not too viscous, sticky, or hard to mix after cooking. For fries and chips, sweet potatoes should have higher dry-matter content for good texture, low reducing sugars, and free amino acids for less browning and low acrylamide formation during frying, Truong says. Scientists believe that the sweet potato was domesticated more than 5,000 years ago, but there is debate as to whether this took place in South America or Central America. However, everyone agrees that the sweet potato ranks as one of the healthiest vegetables because of its high levels of vitamins A and C, iron, potassium and fiber.

"From Commerce to Conservation, Coastal Areas Reap Rewards  Looks can be deceiving. Take the Houston Ship Channel located just east of the city of Houston. To the casual observer with a windshield view, they might briefly note the shipping vessels, grain elevators and day-to-day commerce as they speed by. However, it’s on the Houston Ship Channel’s waters where, for some, the real action is taking place. This is where commerce meets conservation. According to the Port of Houston Authority, an estimated 200 million tons of commodities and products annually pass through the 52-mile ship channel aboard more than 8,000 shipping vessels.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Oct 22,  Well Farm at Voris Field, Peoria, Illinois. Deep in the heart of the Corn Belt, a different kind of agriculture is taking root in the city of Peoria, Illinois. Back in , USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded Chicago-based Greenprint Partners a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG). Partnering with the city and other local community groups, a long-vacant lot in downtown Peoria has been transformed into a vibrant community gathering space with green infrastructure, an urban forest, and a working farm. Well Farm, covering 1.5 acres, was engineered and contoured to optimize stormwater management. Vegetables and flowers are grown in raised beds and later sold at the Peoria farmers market. The planted trees are hybrid poplars, a fast-growing species that take up a lot of water and can ultimately be harvested for timber. Well Farm is one of the nation’s first stormwater farms, capturing stormwater runoff while growing harvestable timber and vegetables. The farm is fully instrumented to measure the site’s success in managing stormwater. You may view the below video or visit the The Well Farm video about the project. It is not just the citizens of Peoria that have recognized the value of this project, Greenprint Partners was awarded the prestigious U.S. Water Prize (, 222 ) in the Private Sector category for its work in advancing the way stormwater is managed for partner City of Peoria, Illinois. Greenprint Partners was recognized for its leadership as the project developer and program manager for an innovative stormwater management system and community engagement program at Well Farm. The project’s mix of green features, underground storage, and urban agriculture prevents more than a million gallons of stormwater from entering Peoria’s combined sewer each year. Greenprint Partners process engaged a team of more than 20 community stakeholders to ensure alignment, positive neighborhood impacts, and ongoing project success. The project transformed the property, and also delivers $1.50 in economic activity for every $1 invested. It has created nearly 30 full-time jobs. Through the Conservation Innovation Grants (CIG) program, NRCS funds projects that develop innovative approaches and technologies for natural resource conservation on agricultural lands. These grants have funded more than 60 environmental markets projects, including a number of the nation’s leading market efforts. Find out more about NRCS Conservation Innovation Grants.

"Nevada State Director, USDA Rural Development in  USDA Results  Energy  Rural  Feb 12,  Secretary Vilsack receives the National Energy Leadership Award from the National Biodiesel Board. The award is given periodically to individuals who demonstrate exemplary vision and leadership in development of the renewable fuels industry. Pictured left to right are Ed Ulch, Governing Board Member, National Biodiesel Board; Secretary Tom Vilsack; and Joe Jobe, CEO, National Biodiesel Board. In the days after the Super Bowl it is not unusual for spectators to “Monday morning quarterback” the advertisements, as well as the plays that were called.  For the members of two renewable fuels industries, however, there was no disputing the message of the now famous “God made a farmer” ad featuring Paul Harvey.  Last week in Las Vegas, the Renewable Fuels Association and the National Biodiesel Board both led off their meetings with this ad before Secretary Vilsack spoke. It became a starting point to discuss the Secretary’s compelling vision for rebuilding the rural economy, furthering efforts to develop advanced new biofuels, and creating more jobs in our small towns to grow and strengthen the middle class. Secretary Vilsack shared his personal motivation for building rural vitality, which stems from being a small town Iowa  lawyer in the ’s, first helping farmers do their taxes and later helping others weather that economic farm crisis that led to too many losing their farms. Moving forward more than twenty-five years, Secretary Vilsack highlighted today’s modern, inspiring rural America – and offered a reminder that rural America provides a great deal to everyone across our nation. Rural America provides an abundant and safe food supply, growing more than 85 percent of the food our nation consumes. Rural America provides clean water and soil, with more than 80 percent of the potable water that is domestically consumed first being filtered through U.S. Forest Service watersheds as well as privately owned lands in rural areas.  It provides a majority of America’s fuel and energy – both through traditional means and by producing groundbreaking biofuels. And he discussed how rural values stand at the heart of our national values. Rural Americans understand that you can’t just take from the nation that has given us all so much – you have to give back. That’s perhaps why our nation’s military is disproportionately represented by folks from rural America. Secretary Vilsack shared with the renewable fuels leaders his belief in their work and his expectations for them – that they are at the leading edge of creating an amazing new bio-based economy that will create jobs and opportunity across rural America.  The innovation and entrepreneurship that they have demonstrated in turning not only grain, but agricultural waste, algae, and other forms of advanced biomass into biofuels is just the start. Secretary Vilsack highlighted new research into groundbreaking new plastics, chemicals, polymers, and other bio-based products that he wants to see produced throughout rural America – and believe me, USDA Rural Development, with our ability to finance infrastructure, housing, and business development, shares his vision. Secretary Vilsack’s belief in the future of the biobased economy is one part of his vision for a thriving rural America in the years to come. He shared with the renewable fuels leaders that USDA’s efforts to open new markets and new opportunity for biobased products is just the first of four important pillars that we’ll focus on this year.  Second, we’ll continue expanding export markets to further strengthen production agriculture. Third, we will help rural communities and landowners enhance their conservation efforts and create more jobs related to outdoor recreation - which together are worth billions in revenue and priceless benefits in terms of topsoil and species saved, and pollution avoided. Finally we will look to create new markets for local and regional food system development, which gives the small farmer a way into the market while increasing Americans’ access to fresh, healthy local foods. The Secretary’s final point really stuck with me as well -- that he wants rural America to join in turning the tide of our nation from a country that primarily consumes, to one that grows, creates, and produces even more.  Secretary Vilsack outlined in Las Vegas the unlimited opportunity that our rural communities can achieve – and how rural America will continue to strengthen our nation as a whole. He knows that the hard work, innovation, and entrepreneurship of rural America will be critical to building a new bio-based economy, and supporting new markets for new innovation to ensure rural America is a great place to live, work and raise a family for generations to come.  Right on, Mr. Secretary.

"Administrator, USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 11,  WIC nutritionists discuss healthy food choices with program participants and children. USDA’s nutrition assistance programs provide access to a healthy diet for millions of eligible Americans each month. Whether in schools, community feeding sites, or in households across the country, they comprise a nutrition safety net to ensure that no eligible American goes hungry. In my opinion the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, better known as “WIC,” is indeed a special program. It provides supplemental foods to our most vulnerable -- infants, pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women, and children up to age five who are at nutritional risk.  WIC also provides referrals to social and health care services and nutrition education, including breastfeeding promotion and support. And it’s working, as a new USDA report on WIC Participant and Program Characteristics released today shows. Researchers found, for example, that breastfeeding among WIC participants increased by four percentage points in two years.  Among WIC state agencies that reported breastfeeding for , 67 percent of all 6- to 13-month-old infants were currently breastfed or were breastfed at some time, compared with 63 percent in , the last time a participant profile study was conducted. In fact, breastfeeding among WIC participants has been steadily increasing since , and this year, for the first time, the percentage of breastfeeding women exceeded that of non-breastfeeding, postpartum women. That’s a good thing because breastfeeding is the optimal method of feeding infants, as it provides positive health benefits for both the mother and child. And WIC is reaching those in need -- low-income mothers and children at nutritional risk. Among the over 9 million WIC participants who reported incomes, nearly three-quarters had incomes below the federal poverty level, as compared to 15 percent of the U.S. population. The great majority of those enrolled in WIC were infants and children under the age of five, and more than half of all WIC participants were less than 3 years of age. Good news, too, is that child obesity has begun to decline among WIC participants. In , 15.3 percent of WIC children who were one year old were considered overweight compared with 16.8 percent in . Similarly, for children ages two to four, 14.7 percent were overweight in compared with 14.0 percent in . The Centers for Disease Control looked into this more closely using mostly WIC from 43 States and territories on 2 to 4 year old children for to . They found that reversing the previous upward trend, 19 States/territories had significant reduction in obesity and 21 showed no increase, with only 3 showing an increase. WIC is helping to shape the future of our country in a vital way by providing expectant and nursing mothers and young children the nutrition they need for healthy birth outcomes or, in the case of the young ones, to grow up healthy and strong. In fact, earlier research has shown that WIC has been playing in important role in improving birth outcomes, including fewer premature births, and containing healthcare costs.  This is a program that is not only providing nutrition to low income families, but reducing infant mortality and truly creating a Healthier Next Generation.

"USDA Rural Development Wisconsin Public Affairs Coordinator in  Rural  Research and Science  Aug 15,   The Lake Holcombe High School in Holcombe, Wisconsin recently upgraded its science classroom as a result of a USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Economic Impact Initiative Grant.  Holcombe is a small rural community in the northwest area of the state.  The science classroom was outdated, making it difficult for the teachers to keep pace with new curriculum requirements and for students to conduct the necessary science experiments for that curriculum. The newly redesigned science classroom is now compliant with the provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and is similar to other high school science classrooms in the state.  A tank was also installed, along with new plumbing, to provide treatment for the chemical waste generated from science-related class work.  Now, the science curriculum can be expanded to offer experiences and experiments to the students that are equivalent with other science courses offered to their peers in the state.  In addition, new flooring, counters tops, bench fuel valves, sinks, and cabinets were installed, bringing the classroom into the 21st century.  The - school year will be the first full year that the students will have access to the improvements.

"Tongass National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 07,  Mount Edgecumbe volcano is on Kruzof Island in Southeast Alaska, just west of Sitka. The Mount Edgecumbe Volcanic Field consists of more than a dozen volcanic vents and domes. The field first erupted more than 600,000 years ago, and volcanic activity continued until 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. (U.S. Forest Service/Jim Baichtal) Seldom does one find a way to directly date a prehistoric volcanic eruption, but 11-year-old Blake LaPerriere opened such a door for excited scientists in Southeast Alaska. Last September, Blake, his parents, and his younger brothers were exploring a beach on southwestern Kruzof Island, part of the Tongass National Forest landscape and just west of Sitka, Alaska, where they live. Blake investigated a deeply incised creek behind a pile of beach drift where he found a standing burnt tree embedded in a tall bank of pumice. He brought it to his family’s attention, asking “Do you think that’s from a volcanic eruption a long time ago?” Curious, Blake’s father Zach took photos and sent them my way. As the forest’s geologist, it didn’t take me long to respond. Thanks to good weather, I was able to travel by boat to meet the family at the site the next weekend. Accompanied by Kitty LaBounty, assistant professor of natural sciences at University of Alaska Southeast, Deidra LaBounty, a geology student volunteer, and Jay Kinsman, a Forest Service geologist, we examined the site. We carefully documented what we found, sending samples of the wood from the embedded tree to a lab for radiocarbon dating and to the University of Oregon for identification. First, we learned that the tree was indeed ancient – dating back 13,180 years. Then, Jamie Dexter from the University of Oregon confirmed the tree as Picea sitchensis, or Sitka spruce, making this one of the oldest records of Sitka spruce in Southeastern Alaska. After I gave Blake the news on the age and identification of his find, I explained how the tree came to be there. Southern Kruzof Island consists of more than a dozen volcanic vents and domes referred to as the Mount Edgecumbe Volcanic Field. Mount Edgecumbe dominates the landscape rising to more than 3,200 feet.  Its symmetric cone and crater create a striking image. The field first erupted approximately 600,000 years ago, with volcanic activity continuing until 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. U.S. Forest Service geologist Jim Baichtal congratulates 11-year-old Blake LaPerriere for his discovery Sept. 9, , of an ancient Sitka spruce tree buried by an eruption from Mount Edgecumbe volcano about 13,200 years ago. (Courtesy of Zach LaPerriere) About 13,180 years ago, a violent eruption on Crater Ridge just north of Mount Edgecumbe resulted in deep deposits of rhyolitic airfall, what we know as pumice and ash, and pyroclastic flows or fluidized rock fragments and hot gases. These fast moving flows swept down from the saddle between Crater Ridge and Mount Edgecumbe, rapidly burying the forest and vegetation on the lower slopes. Blake had discovered one of these trees. Knowing the tree’s age helps scientists establish the age of the simultaneous eruptions which spread ash across much of Southeast Alaska. Interestingly, at the time of the eruption that encased the Kruzof tree, global sea levels were about 174 feet lower than today. The lands west of Sitka were a coastal plane with fresh water lakes. The Kruzof tree is a record of an established forest in what was likely a refugium – a place where plants and animals persisted during the last ice age. This preserved relic gives us a small snapshot into the timing and extent of glaciation, the prehistoric climate, and the possibility of refugia where other plant and animals persisted and early migrants to North America may have passed. About 250 years after the eruption that trapped the tree, rising sea levels inundated the coastal plane and fresh water lakes creating Sitka Sound. My plan is to return to the area in the future to see if other trees emerge as waves erode the bank. I’ll be looking for evidence of the soil and vegetation, which must be buried beneath the pumice flow. Read more on the area’s geologic history and the Alaska Volcano Observatory at these links.

"Gardens Unit Leader, U.S. National Arboretum in  Research and Science  Nov 01,  Fothergilla leaves make the transition from green to red in the National Herb Garden at the U.S. National Arboretum. (Photo credit U.S. National Arboretum) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Like a lot of people, I remember being taught when I was young that the brilliant autumn foliage of deciduous trees was caused by the cold temperatures of autumn frosts.  I believed this until I became a horticulturist, studying the intricate system that plants use to prepare for winter’s harsh weather.  Where I work, at the U.S. National Arboretum, we grow about 10,000 different kinds of trees and shrubs and have an overwhelming variety of fall color right now. Daylength (or more correctly, the length of nights) is the real cause of trees’ transition to autumn .  (Read more here about how longer nights translate into the vibrant color of autumn.) So what role does frost play in the changing color of autumn leaves?  Frost actually ruins vivid fall by causing cells in the leaf to rupture and die. The appearance of fall shifts each year due to weather. Heavy cloud cover limits ultraviolet light, so the chlorophyll lasts longer, and leaves stay green longer. High night temperatures cause cells to burn accumulated sugars, so less red and purple pigments are formed and yellow and orange are the predominant . Drought stress or a windy interlude cause leaves to drop prematurely. The ideal conditions are warm, sunny days and cool nights with little wind or drought stress. At the Arboretum, you can watch this process in action through the course of many months this time of year. Dogwoods begin to turn in late September, and Chinese fringetree ends its show of in early December. Even some of our herbaceous plants have great fall color—most notably the willow amsonia, which you will find near the Capital Columns with ‘Raydon’s Favorite’ asters that are in full bloom right now, also in response to the longer nights of autumn. Willow amsonia blooms in late spring. There’s a lot to enjoy about the changes autumn brings to the plants around us. Come to the Arboretum and see it.  If you’d like to learn more about fall color, attend my lecture on the topic at the U.S. National Arboretum from 1-2 pm on Nov. 5, followed by a fall color tour led by Horticulturist Mariya Navazio. With sunny weather forecast this week, maples, hickories, and oaks will be at or near peak fall color.

"Deputy Administrator for Office of Policy Support, Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Aug 09,   As directed by Congress in , USDA is re-evaluating the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP)—the estimated cost of an affordable, nutritious diet. The TFP is used to calculate SNAP benefit levels. To complement the re-evaluation efforts and gather insights from those who will be impacted by the result, USDA recently hosted five listening sessions with SNAP participants, researchers, advocates, and others. Here’s some of what we heard: Families are struggling to get enough food with current SNAP benefit levels: Dr. Valerie Smith, a Tyler, Texas pediatrician, said she sees “too many families and children of all ages who consistently don't have enough food to make it through the month [to] decrease food insecurity and set children up with healthy eating habits for the rest of their lives.” Limited resources push families to make less healthful choices: “It is hard to choose between having enough to eat and trying to get healthier,” said one SNAP participant, describing the difficult choice to limit fresh food purchases in favor of packaged products that were sometimes less healthful but more affordable. Additional SNAP benefits can promote nutrition security—and make better futures possible: A member of the Association of State Public Health Nutritionists explained that increasing SNAP benefits would not only help families afford nutritious food, but also with “advancing overall health outcomes, lowering healthcare costs, and improving the economy.” USDA appreciates those who shared their time and their experiences with us, as we work to make SNAP as effective as possible.

"Deputy Director of Capacity Building and Development, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Aug 13,   The Waters family farm in Orrick, Mo. had a few unusual guests last week when dozens of African ministers came to learn about their corn, soybean and wheat farm. To embrace the 9th African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Forum’s theme, “New Strategies for a Changing World,” the organizers made some innovative changes, splitting the forum between Washington DC and Kansas City, Mo. Why Kansas City? As a major agricultural hub, Kansas City was ideal for bringing American and African agribusinesses and investors together. It also took the forum beyond policy discussions and into the field, literally. It was the perfect place to demonstrate the close relationship between American farmers and “the people’s department,” as USDA was originally named by Abraham Lincoln. Tom and Karla Waters explained how they plant, harvest, store, and sell crops in their seventh generation farm operation. USDA Farm Service Agency’s county director and an extension agent discussed how the Department supports smallholder farmers and large scale operations such as the Waters’ 5,000 acres through research and training at land-grant universities, and marketing and credit programs. In the Foreign Agricultural Service, I oversee capacity building and development programs, many in Africa. I talked about how our technical assistance programs help give farmers in Africa the same knowledge and tools available to farmers in the United States, through partnerships and coordination with farm groups, governments, and other public and private organizations. The ministers and delegates asked questions about purchasing seeds, planting cycles, irrigation, value-added end products, how prices are determined, and how to make a profit. On the policy side, they gained valuable insight about the Farm Service Agency’s network of service centers where farm loan managers, rural development officers, and extension agents serve the agricultural needs of communities throughout the United States. By seeing the producer-government relationship in action at the farm, I hope the ministers and delegates will take some new ideas and practices to use back home.

"MPH CHES, Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Dec 16,  Roasting is the recommended method for cooking tender meats. To roast, meat is placed on a rack in a shallow, uncovered pan and is cooked by the indirect dry heat of an oven. The traditional centerpiece of many holiday meals served this time of year is the roast. Whether you use pork, beef, goose, turkey, or chicken, the most popular means to cook your meat of choice is in the oven. The roasting recipe that was handed down to you from your great grandmother may need a little updating though. Whether it asks you to marinate at room temperature overnight, or cook until ‘the juices run clear,’ some instructions in heirloom recipes might be outdated. To help you make the dish your great grandmother intended, we pulled together a list of holiday roasting tips. Beef, Veal, Pork and Lamb: To avoid overcooking beef, veal, pork and lamb roasts use a meat thermometer. These roasts should be removed from the oven when they reach an internal temperature of 145 °F. For safety and quality, allow meat to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming. If you’re concerned about serving a dry roast, use a continuous read thermometer or start checking the temperature of your meat earlier then the recipe’s cooking directions. Turkey, Duck, and Goose: Domestic ducklings and geese have a great deal of fat. While it helps them float when swimming, fat is undesirable in a cooked duck. Therefore, it’s recommended to prick or score the skin of a whole duck before cooking so that most of the fat will render out. These birds should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 °F as measured by a food thermometer. Temperatures should be taken in three areas of the bird: the thickest part of the breast, the innermost part of the wing, and the innermost part of the thigh. For more information on safe poultry handling and cooking, read our Thanksgiving material. For approximate cooking times to use in meal planning, visit FoodSafety.gov. For reasons of personal preference, consumers may choose to cook meat to higher temperatures but at the recommended temperatures the food is safe to eat. Following the at FoodSafety.gov will ensure that your roast brings you back to holidays past.

"Deputy Undersecretary for the USDA Food Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 22,   Feeding students healthy, tasty and nutritious school meals can be a challenge.  Just ask any one of the thousands of school nutrition professionals who carry out the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program.  They have to balance menu planning following nutrition standards, financial management, and inventory management, all while making meals that will be enjoyed by students – not always an easy audience.  It is a testament to their dedication that over 90 percent of America’s schools have now implemented the improved standards found in the Healthy Hungry Free Kids Act of . USDA is working hard to find ways to continue to support their efforts. One way we are doing that is a new program that we recently piloted in Mississippi that provides free training through a partnership with the National Food Service Management Institute (NFSMI). The Team Up For School Nutrition Success Training (Team Up) is tailored to schools and covers topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics, and strategies to reduce plate waste.   Another partner in this initiative is First Lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama is grateful for the hard work being done in our country’s school cafeterias, but also recognizes that some may need a little help. When she heard about our initiative, she took the time to make a video to not only thank and encourage the dedicated school food service professional around the country, but to encourage them to take advantage of Team Up. Hear with the First Lady had to say about Team Up:  The name Team Up really says it all. This unique learning experience provides not only professional training and resources, but peer-to-peer mentoring. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other, in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. It isn’t a one-off experience. The peer-to-peer mentoring will continue after trainees return to their districts, and NFSMI will conduct 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups to gauge the success of the plans the schools developed after the training.  If additional training is needed, NFSMI will recommend options based on the schools progress.  The state agencies and USDA Food and Nutrition Services will also provide support and feedback.  I couldn’t be more pleased with what I have heard about the how the first training class went, which was attended by 53 participants and 27 mentors. Participants told us that it was helpful to have a chance to discuss their individual challenges, as well as those that participants had in common. They said that hearing their colleagues and mentors talk about how they have handled some of these challenges in their schools was especially helpful.  Some participants even said that it was the best training they had ever attended!  The Kentucky Department of Education staff was so inspired that they created a video to say what a great experience they had. We look forward to continuing our relationship with the White House and all the trainees. Together we can ensure that America’s students are getting and eating the healthiest food possible during the school day.

"-Reed, Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Research Service and Dr. Melanie Abley, Senior Advisor, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Jan 21,  USDA is collaborating with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the Closer to Zero (C2Z) initiative. C2Z provides a crucial framework for the work that must be done to reduce heavy metal content in foods, but particularly in foods consumed by infants and children, our most vulnerable group. USDA has a wealth of expertise to support FDA in solving this challenge that impacts all Americans. The Agricultural Research Service studies every facet of how plants uptake heavy metals from the soil so that we can find ways to mitigate heavy metals in foods to the greatest extent possible. The National Institute for Food and Agriculture’s vast partner and stakeholder network plans to collaborate in developing and sharing targeted communications on how women who are pregnant and/or lactating, infants, and young children can reduce their exposure to toxic elements in foods. Its investments in agricultural research, education, and extension will help develop -driven approaches to reduce toxic elements in the food production system. The Food Safety and Inspection Service will provide essential oversight for assessing metal contamination in foods. FSIS serves as a critical link in notifying appropriate USDA and FDA offices if elevated levels of a concerning substance are detected in food. As part of their overall mission, the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) encourages consumers to follow a healthy dietary pattern, which is important at every stage of life. The benefits of a balanced diet can help minimize adverse effects of consuming excess of any one food. FNS continues to coordinate with its FDA partners to ensure that USDA nutrition assistance program policies, guidance, and education are informed by current food safety regulations and guidance. As USDA continues its focus on ensuring all Americans have access to nutritious and safe foods, Closer to Zero efforts bring us closer to that goal.

Digital Service staff from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and other agencies shared their experience with USDS, how they are addressing current challenges, and what the future of digital services at their agencies looks like. “We are so appreciative of the great collaboration and partnership with USDS as we work to shape a Digital Service team here at USDA, and we learned a lot about how we can continue to drive this great work here across the many mission areas and missions of USDA,” said Arianne Gallagher-Welcher, Executive Director of the USDA Digital Service and Co-Founder of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program. USDA has seen firsthand the difference digital service can make. As the People’s Department, one of our most important missions is ensuring access to nutritious and safe food. Many of our nation’s youngest children were affected when a manufacturer product recall and weakened supply chains caused an infant formula shortage in . This particularly impacted USDA customers, as families who use our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) buy 56% of all the formula sold in America. With other federal partners, USDA teamed up with the USDS to develop and analyze real-time about the amount of formula available in any given U.S. location. As a result, 388 million bottles of infant formula were imported and deployed to the places that needed it most based on new and analytics. This is just one example of how digital service can deliver solutions for the federal government’s most challenging technology implementation problems. You can learn more about this and other USDS solutions in their Impact Report. Our collaborative partnership with USDS is essential as our new Digital Service team launches. Together, we will build a stronger technology organization at USDA than can more efficiently support our employees and customers in the future.

"Nebraska National Forests, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 27,  Richard Gilbert, Bessey Nursery Manager talks with students from Sandhills Public Schools about the seed collection process, growing process and replanting. (U.S. Forest Service/Tim Buskirk) Two million seedlings will grow up one day to become the forests of our future. The vision for all of those trees is part of the mission of the Charles E. Bessey Nursery, part of the Nebraska National Forests and Grasslands, and the oldest federal seedling nursery in the nation. Working with the Bessey Ranger District and the volunteer group Friends of the Nebraska National Forests, the nursery recently invited the public in for a rare opportunity to see the nursery in full production; growing, packing and shipping hundreds of thousands of seedlings to U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, conservation districts and other government agency locations. The seedlings are used for reforestation following fire and insect infestations, wildlife/habitat plantings, wind breaks, conservation plantings, and general planting. “We’ve just shipped 150,000 container seedlings of Douglas-Fir and Ponderosa Pine to the site of the Hayman fire on the Pike San Isabel National Forests in Colorado,"" says Richard Gilbert, the nursery manager. “These seedlings were grown from cones gathered by forest personnel near Colorado Springs and sent to us for extraction and storage until they are needed. The seedlings were started in February , packed once they were dormant in November , stored in a freezer at 26 degrees, and today we are ready to return them home. It’s gratifying to know we play a part in preserving the natural integrity of our nation’s forests.” According to Gilbert, in addition to the Hayman fire site, another 136,000 container seedlings were shipped to the Pike San Isabel National Forests. Almost 2.3 million seedlings were shipped for spring planting to forests in the Rocky Mountain Region and state agencies including the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest, the Nebraska National Forests,  Grand Mesa, Umcompahgre National Forest , Kansas Forest Service, White River National Forest, Black Hills National Forest and the San Juan National Forest Additional seedlings were sent to Conservation Districts in South Dakota and North Dakota and 1 million went to the Natural Resource Districts of Nebraska.  Large trees were shipped to the Memorial Grove near Monument, Colorado. “It was exciting to have so many students,” said Tim Buskirk, Bessey District ranger. “It was an honor to introduce them to the rich history of Bessey and the unique hand-planted forest. I hope many of them come back with their families soon.” The event also celebrated the kick-off of a new, accessible Discovery Loup Trail to loop through the Bessey Arboretum, conveniently located near the Bessey Visitor Center and Nursery. The three-quarter mile trail will be completed by Friends of the Nebraska National Forests, working together with the Bessey staff. According to volunteer Pam Reed, Nebraska master naturalist, the project involves renovation to a portion of the Bessey Arboretum, new tree identification markers for the 65 tree species located there, interpretive exhibits and a kiosk. Educational materials will showcase this unique Nebraska ecosystem, and the experimental, hand-planted forest and federal nursery.

"Seeing is Believing: Soil Health Practices and No-Till Farming Transform Landscapes and Produce Nutritious Food  This month, we’re highlighting 12 important gifts given to us when we conserve natural resources: soil, food, plants, wildlife, people, health, protection, recreation, air, water, technology and the future. NRCS’ mission is to conserve the full range of natural resources, but soil health is our foundation. And it’s the first conservation gift that we’re going to highlight. And without soil, we couldn’t celebrate with food. We encourage you to give the gift of conservation this season! Curbing Soil Erosion Soil is the foundation for a healthy environment. If you need proof that no-till farming works, look no further than the rolling hills of north-central Oregon.

"Agricultural Attaché, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  May 04,  Consul General Ricardo Zuniga displays U.S. beef ready for Brazilian customers representing more than a decade of work. U.S. fresh beef exports are back in Brazil! Following a 13-year hiatus, the first shipment of U.S. fresh beef has arrived in Brazil, ushering in promising long-term market opportunities for the U.S. beef industry. In , the United States exported $6.3 billion in beef and beef products globally. With Brazil’s large market reopened to the United States, U.S. beef exports are poised for new growth. Brazil closed its market to imports of U.S. fresh beef in over concerns about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Since then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service worked continuously with Brazilian officials to regain market access. Additionally, USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has provided documentation and information on the U.S. food safety requirements and standards for beef. Following numerous technical discussions and meetings, Brazil officially reopened the market in August based on the United States’ classification by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as a negligible risk country for BSE. As the U.S. agriculture industry witnesses this first shipment of fresh beef arriving in Brazil, it’s the ideal time for U.S. exporters to re-engage in marketing efforts in the country. Currently, Brazil’s main suppliers of fresh/chilled beef are Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina – both because of their proximity to Brazil and because they enjoy duty-free access as a result of the Mercosur customs union. From -, Brazil imported an average of $296 million of fresh/frozen beef, or 50,000 metric tons, annually. Despite the competition from Mercosur countries and a 10-percent tariff differential for countries outside the customs union, the United States is in a great position to compete in the Brazilian market thanks to the ability to target high-end consumers. The FAS Agricultural Trade Office in Sao Paulo recently launched the – a market promotion campaign to support the branding and promotion of U.S. food and beverage products in Brazil, including U.S. beef.  Brazil boasts a population of more than 206 million people, with more than 40 percent of the population in the middle class and 16 million high-end consumers.  Despite the country’s current economic crisis, it is a promising market for U.S. high-value products, like fresh beef. Brazilians are familiar with the quality and diversity of U.S. food products and there is a demand for high-quality cuts of beef in both the foodservice and high-end retail sectors. Since Brazil first announced the reopening of its market to U.S. fresh beef, USDA has worked with Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Food Supply on the food safety protocols and label approval process for U.S. firms wanting to ship to Brazil. An agreement was reached in December that met Brazil’s product labelling approval requirements. Visit the FSIS Export Library for updated information on Brazil’s export requirements for U.S. meat, poultry and processed egg products, including detailed instructions for shipping U.S. fresh beef and beef products to Brazil.

Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service Six months after being hired by the U.S. Forest Service, Angelica Perez-Delgado made a major impact, including international assistance to the country of Georgia, on her way to being named Rookie of the Year for the Pacific Southwest Region late in . When a major storm event triggered a landslide in the Black Sea facing nation of Georgia in early this past year, destroying roadways, the country turned to the U.S. Forest Service for assistance. Almost immediately, Perez-Delgado started assisting the Forest Service project team for Georgia with support in mapping and computerized drawings. The recent Chico State University grad, from Burney, Calif., was hired by the Shasta-Trinity National Forest as a Civil Engineer less than one year after graduating college and was already involved in an important international project. “She did a great job with email instructions and coming up with the product that was needed in the summer of right after the landslide,” said Rene Renteria, geotechnical and dams group leader with the U.S. Forest Service. “When I had the opportunity to create a team to go over to Tbilisi, Georgia this past January through February, I wanted her civil engineering skills. I was impressed right away with her go-to attitude.” For Georgia, Perez-Delgado designed the new roadway alignment and tunnel location outside the boundaries of the landslide using LIDAR, Autocad and Civil 3D.  She provided everything needed, including plan and profile drawings and calculations in metric, to begin construction for emergency response. Angelica provided drawings of what the roads should look like to include a retaining wall, culverts and estimates on how much the costs would be for local contractors. Oftentimes, her work included standing outside in minus 10 degree Celsius doing surveys. That didn’t stop her from getting the job done, in fact, Perez-Delgado was more concerned about her colleagues in Georgia. “They have such a crazy work ethic there,” she said.  “One guy didn’t even have a warm coat or gloves, but here he was out there with me in such cold weather. I told him to take a break and warm up his hands in the car.” Angelica Perez-Delgado takes a selfie in the freezing temperature of winter in the mountain of the nation of Georgia.

"APHIS Aquaculture Program Manager, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  Jun 06,   If someone told you there were simple things you could do to keep fish from dying and protect our waters, you’d want to know more, right? Well, if you’re a boater or angler in the Great Lakes region, there’s a lot you can do to stop the spread of a fish disease called viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). VHS kills freshwater and marine fish, including some species of bass, trout and perch. The good news is you can help fight the disease by remembering to clean boats and fishing equipment. It’s also important not to transfer bait, water and mud from one waterway to another. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) created a Focus On Fish Health campaign to let boaters and anglers know that they’re on the front lines of slowing the spread of VHS. Find out more at www.FocusOnFishHealth.org. The Focus On Fish website has some great information on the disease--such as how to recognize signs of VHS--and advice on how to dispose of dead fish and unused bait. If you belong to a boating or angling group, the APHIS website tells you how to get free materials, including palm cards and Power Point tools, so you can get the word out to others. And while you are out on the water having fun, be sure to bring your camera!  Enter our photo contest, where you can submit pictures of the biggest fish you ever caught or share memories of good times on the water. There are two categories: Your Best Catch and Family Fun on the Water. Winning photos get posted on the Focus On Fish Health website. If you win, you get a free tee-shirt, duffle bag and hat. You can submit up to three photos each month and winners will be announced at the end of June, July and August. For more information on contest rules and , visit www.FocusOnFishHealth.org.

"How FNS Partners Take Their Summer Feeding Sites to the Next Level  USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service partners serve a vital role in the success of the federal Summer Food Service Program (SFSP).  These important relationships are critical to helping operate and expand summer meals and sites so that no child or teen goes hungry when school is out. Evaluating their best practices and listening to their anecdotes confirms that kids truly depend on these healthy meals over the course of the summer.  During the first day of the summer feeding program, the Hopkins County Family YMCA in Kentucky served over 500 meals.  But that’s not the only difference they made that day.  The director was at the store picking up supplies, when the cashier asked about her purchase.  The director explained the details of the program and the woman’s eyes filled with tears, as she relayed that her husband just lost his job and the family had become desperate.  She was put at ease knowing that the Summer Food Service Program will be available to feed her children this summer.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food Safety in  Health and Safety  May 02, 2013   Cross posted from Food Safety News:  My passion for public health stems from my career as an infectious disease doctor, watching families cope with the heartbreak caused by preventable diseases, including foodborne illness.  I know what it feels like to explain to a husband in shock that the reason his wife is on life support is because of something she ate that was contaminated with a deadly pathogen. Now, I am the Under Secretary for Food Safety at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  In my current role, I oversee dedicated USDA inspectors, scientists, veterinarians, and numerous other personnel who protect food that we eat every day.  There is nothing more fundamental than being able to feed your own family a meal that will not make you sick, or worse, put you in the hospital. I understand that there has been a lot of confusion about a proposal by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to modernize inspection at poultry slaughter plants. I would like to try to eliminate that confusion. First and most importantly, we put forward this modernization proposal because we have data demonstrating that the system it embodies will prevent foodborne illnesses – approximately 5,000 per year.  It will prevent illnesses by making commonsense, scientifically-verified changes in the way inspection personnel do their work in plants. This is significant because for the past 10 years, the food safety community hasn’t been able to make any headway in the fight against two dangerous strains of bacteria that are commonly found in poultry products – Salmonella and Campylobacter. While poultry only accounts for a fraction of the illnesses attributable to Salmonella and Campylobacter illnesses, the numbers from these pathogens are still significant—together, these two bacteria cause an approximate 344,000 poultry-associated foodborne illnesses every year.  The most troubling aspect of these data is that, despite all our efforts, rates of illness caused by these two foodborne pathogens have been stagnant, even showing occasional rises, in recent years. We need to find a way to reverse the trend, and if we are to do so, one thing is clear: we cannot continue regulating the poultry industry as we have.  FSIS can’t keep focusing on food quality assurance tasks – work that our food safety inspectors are currently doing – and simply cross our fingers, hoping that checking for extra feathers and bruises in chickens will make a dent in the rates of illnesses caused by Salmonella and Campylobacter.   We need all of our employees to be focused on a single purpose: to protect public health through food safety.   Our inspectors shouldn’t be doing a company’s quality assurance work.  They should be making sure that a company produces safe food. Under our newly proposed inspection system, most inspectors who have performed quality control checks under our old system would perform food safety tasks that have been demonstrated to make your food safer, like making sure a company’s food safety plan is effective and conducting tests for the harmful pathogens which actually cause foodborne illness. We started testing a new type of inspection system in a pilot program that began in 1999.  In these plants, Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination rates actually decreased quite quickly.  This refocused inspection works. If we were to finalize our proposal and implement this new type of inspection system broadly, we would be enabling our employees to do more, and we as an Agency would be doing a better job, to fulfill our mission. We would still be in every poultry slaughter plant every day, inspecting every chicken that enters the food supply.  We would just be doing it better. I understand that in the course of this discussion, some have raised concerns for the workers in poultry plants.  They ask – if this new inspection system causes changes in the way that plants operate – will it make poultry plants more dangerous for the people who work there? Let me be clear: USDA would never put forward a rule that would put anyone in harm’s way.  This is not a choice between food safety and worker safety.  The data that we have to date does not show any link between this new type of inspection system and increased risk for poultry industry employees or our own inspection personnel.  And as we evaluate next steps for this proposal, we are working with our federal partners to ensure that worker health isn’t harmed – and is in fact improved. I don’t want to minimize the discussion about worker health.  We do need to have a discussion on the health of workers in the industry.  That discussion is underway.  While we as a food safety agency do not have the ability or expertise to regulate worker safety, we have been working closely with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health on important efforts to strengthen the federal government’s data collection and enforcement activities in this space.  These two federal agencies have the regulatory authority and expertise to improve worker safety. As a result of these efforts – and the discussion started by this proposed rule – we as a federal government are talking about worker health in the poultry industry in a way that we never have before. Most importantly, our data show that we can make progress in meeting our mission and ensuring a safer food supply.  We have a major tool at our disposal to reduce foodborne illness, and this is but one of many ways that USDA is working hard to keep you safe from foodborne illness.  If you had the opportunity to save a life, to spare a mother or father from the agony of having a child in the hospital, wouldn’t you jump at the chance?

"New Land Ownership Add Value to Many Policy and Research Questions  Whether they farm the land themselves or rent it out to others to farm, those who own agricultural land are taking measures to keep the land in their families. This is good news for those who worry about the United States losing agricultural land to competing pressures. At USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, we just released the findings from a survey of agricultural landowners conducted earlier this year. It confirmed some things we know already and generated lots of new information that farmers, policymakers, businesses and others will use to understand more about who owns farmland, who has and will have access to farmland in the future, what kinds of conservation and production decision landowners are making, and lots more.

"in  USDA Results  Jul 14,  Tennessee Gourmet Co-Owner and Cumberland Culinary Center Manager Sue Sykes shows off new equipment purchased with help from a USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant at Cumberland University's Cumberland Culinary Center. Born and raised in New England I can’t claim to know the finer details and intricacies of the delicious and competitive world of barbeque.  So when I came to Tennessee to highlight economic development opportunities at Cumberland University’s Cumberland Culinary Center I was pleased to see first-hand just how intense that competition can be  and how that competition is fueling small business opportunities and growth in rural Tennessee. The Cumberland Culinary Center is a community kitchen and small business incubator that has received support from USDA’s Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) program. The center is a great example of the opportunities that exist when we brings together federal, state and local resources. The center is designed to meet the growing needs of farmers, agri-entrepreneurs and other businesses by helping them overcome the financial obstacles and start-up costs of constructing a commercial kitchen. One such entrepreneur is Ron Reed, owner and expert at Ron Reed’s Signature Barbeque Sauce Company. Ron was one of six small businesses, and four barbeque sauce companies utilizing the facility to cook and prepare his signature sauce.  Ron uses the kitchen on a basis and pays a rental fee that grants him access to equipment that would otherwise cost him tens of thousands of dollars and prevent him from pursuing his dream. The importance of these programs for developing and strengthening rural economies is clearly stated in Ron’s own words: ”USDA's commitment to the future of rural communities truly does impact folks like me. I have always had a passion for cooking and an entrepreneurial spirit. The support that the USDA has provided to the Cumberland Culinary Center has given me the opportunity to take my passion and turn it into a growing business, that one day will assist with adding jobs to our local community.” Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan joins Ron Reed at the Cumberland Culinary Center.  Now this is where the competition started to heat up. The Center is also home to another three barbeque entrepreneurs - R&R Condiments, producer of OL’ SOUTH Fine Swine Bar-B-Que Sauce, BBQ Fight Club sauces, and Smokey’s Gourmet Products, producer of Smokey Cornwall’s BBQ Sauce. Not wanting to get caught in the middle of what clearly involves a lot of time, hard work, and culinary creativity, I will leave judgment on this battle to the more seasoned barbeque connoisseurs. If you have a small business or a dream that you want to pursue, I encourage you to follow in Ron’s footsteps and reach out to your local USDA Rural Development office.

"Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Oct 05,  A local farmer explains how his hoop houses allow him to maintain his crops through a tough Minnesota winter. In September, I was one of 28 Junior Professionals and two advisors from USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) who traveled to the Midwest for an annual agricultural training trip. This training opportunity exposed members of FAS’s Junior Professional Advisory Committee (JPAC) to a broad range of U.S. agriculture in Minnesota and Iowa. The trip also helped maintain and build direct relationships with the U.S. agricultural industry, reinforcing the Agency’s connection to its primary constituents. In Austin, MN, we toured Hormel’s meat processing facilities. Afterwards, we learned more about the company during a presentation and tour of the SPAM Museum. SPAM is by far the biggest product for Hormel, with strong export potential due to high demand from foreign markets. South Korea is currently the biggest overseas market for SPAM, but Hormel is also focusing its marketing on mainland Japan and China. One of the biggest challenges in its export market is SPAM education – teaching potential customers how to cook and prepare SPAM. In its effort to export to foreign markets, Hormel uses different flavors of SPAM, and its marketing campaigns vary to improve brand status within the respective export destinations. Another highlight of the trip was a visit to Absolute Energy, LLC, a locally owned company with offices in Minnesota and Iowa that seeks to increase economic development in the local area, add value to corn production, provide a return on investments for investors, and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. We learned a lot about the ethanol process and toured the grounds of the facility, which produces 120 million gallons of ethanol each year. This geographical region presented a unique opportunity for our staff to observe the development, harvesting, processing, and marketing of major commodity crops, processed products meat, and horticultural products as well as operations at an ethanol plant, milling facility, port, and the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. Participants had the opportunity to learn more about the various types of agricultural businesses, from large companies like Cargill and Hormel, to family farms who are active participants in Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) shares and farmers markets. Our visit to the Midwest allowed us to personally witness how public and private partnerships are being utilized to increase U.S. exports and promote sustainable development in the agriculture industry both domestically and abroad. It was extremely beneficial to hear directly from those affected and the impact this has on their goals, both domestically and in the export market. Trip participants paid a visit to Hormel where they learned about meat processing and about the impact of exports on the company.

"Acting Under Secretary for Food Safety in  Health and Safety  May 16,   As grilling season heats up, the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is enhancing our food safety testing program for ground beef.  While FSIS has a range of safeguards to reduce E. coli in ground beef, this summer we will begin new testing to improve the safeguards against Salmonella as well.  Salmonella is commonly found in ground beef and, in fact, caused an illness outbreak in January in six states.  Salmonella is an especially difficult bacteria for food safety experts to address because it is so prevalent in almost all food sources. Recognizing that we need more information about the prevalence of Salmonella in ground beef to better prevent food-borne illness, FSIS is “super-sizing” our pathogen testing program to include Salmonella every time our laboratories test for E. coli in samples of ground beef and ground beef sources. Because the samples taken for E. coli testing are much larger than those we have taken in the past for Salmonella, there is higher likelihood that we will be able to detect the bacteria if it is present. Once FSIS has collected enough about the prevalence of Salmonella in ground beef, we will create a new standard to encourage ground beef processors to strengthen their Salmonella controls, resulting in safer products and fewer foodborne illnesses.  The collection process will take some time, but it is critical that the new standard is supported by meaningful .  Of course, we will continue to analyze any positive samples for multi-drug resistance and specific serotypes to determine whether they are contributing to human illnesses. Salmonella is the most urgent issue facing FSIS when it comes to protecting consumers and it is why we developed our Salmonella Action Plan.  This plan details our strategy for reducing the number of Salmonella-related illnesses, and this enhancement to our sampling and testing programs is part of that comprehensive effort.  Another part of our war on Salmonella is encouraging consumers to take steps to protect themselves from illnesses, including cooking all ground beef to 160 °F (poultry should be cooked to 165 °F).  For more information on ways to keep your family Salmonella-free this summer, we invite you to check out FoodSafety.gov or AskKaren.gov before your next cook out.
