"What is nutrition security? Building on and complementing our long-standing efforts to address food security, we are expanding our efforts to advance food and nutrition security. Nutrition security means all Americans have consistent and equitable access to healthy, safe, affordable foods essential to optimal health and well-being. Our approach to tackling food and nutrition insecurity aims to:  Recognize that structural inequities make it hard for many people to eat healthy and be physically active; and  Emphasize taking an equity lens to our efforts.  Learn more  A household is food secure if all members, at all times, can access enough food for an active, healthy life. At a minimum, food security includes:  Readily available nutritionally adequate and safe foods, and  The ability to acquire those foods in socially acceptable ways (without resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies).  Nutrition security means consistent access, availability, and affordability of foods and beverages that promote well-being, prevent disease, and, if needed, treat disease, particularly among racial/ethnic minority, lower income, and rural and remote populations including Tribal communities and Insular areas. Nutrition security is an emerging concept that complements efforts to increase food security while also:  Recognizing that Americans, in general, fall short of an active, healthy lifestyle aligned with Federal dietary and physical activity guidelines, and  Emphasizing equity to ensure our efforts serve all populations to promote access, availability, and affordability to foods and beverages, and address the connection between food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases. View the Infographic (, 420 ) What is the problem? Poor nutrition is a leading cause of illness in the United States, associated with more than half a million deaths per year. It is linked with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease as well as broader impacts including higher health care costs and decreased productivity.  Learn more  Poor nutrition is widespread  Though poor nutrition affects every demographic, diet-related diseases hit harder among historically underserved communities.  The overall diet quality score for Americans is 59 out of 100, indicating that the average American diet does not align with Federal dietary recommendations. However, the resulting health burden is not equally shared. Certain populations are at greater risk for diet-related disease. For example, Black and Indigenous children are more likely to have obesity than their white peers. Those who face food insecurity are also at greater risk.  Beyond the effect on health, poor nutrition and diet-related diseases have far-reaching impacts including decreased academic achievement and increased financial stress. That translates to societal impacts as well—lower productivity, weakened military readiness, widening health disparities, and skyrocketing health care costs. For example, approximately 85 percent of current health care spending is related to management of diet-related chronic disease.  To make progress on these problems, Americans need equitable access to healthy foods that promote well-being. What is USDA doing? USDA wants input from all Americans on ways we can improve nutrition security. The department is particularly focused on strengthening and building new partnerships with all levels of government, the private sector, community-based organizations, and families. Together, we can make progress that will change lives and ensure a healthier, more prosperous future for all Americans.  Learn more  USDA’s work to advance nutrition security focuses on four pillars:  Meaningful Support  Healthy Food  Collaborative Action  Equitable Systems  Research and evaluation  USDA’s work on nutrition security is driven by research and grounded in science. In addition to the extensive research performed by the Food and Nutrition Service, the Agricultural Research Service has six human nutrition research centers, the Economic Research Service studies numerous topics central to food and nutrition security, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture advances food and nutrition security through research, education, extension, and innovation. Our work is also driven by the lived experiences – of our staff and our stakeholders.  Learn more about our nutrition security research.

"It's Time to Talk about the Birds and the Bees -- and the Butterflies, Bats and Beetles  Cross-posted from the Department of Interior blog: From birds and bees to butterflies, bats and beetles, pollinators are a diverse group and are critically important to terrestrial life on our planet. Without our help, however, their populations will continue to decline as a result of numerous stressors including loss of habitat, pests and pathogens, and exposure to pesticides. Bees and other pollinators are essential to America’s agricultural economy and maintain the beauty of our iconic landscapes. Without them, we wouldn’t have most of our vegetables, flowers, fruits or nuts. Honey-bee pollinations alone contribute more than $15 billion in value to U.S. agricultural production each year, but beekeepers reported losing just over 23 percent of honey bee colonies last winter. Other pollinators that help sustain food production and the environment—such as native bees and bats—also are declining.  Ann Mills, USDA Deputy Under Secretary for Natural Resources and the Environment and Jon Jarvis, National Park Service Director  Posted in  Animals  Plants  Jun 16, 2015  Respond to this story","What is a major threat to pollinators such as bees, butterflies, bats, and beetles, according to beekeepers' reports?","According to beekeepers' reports, a major threat to pollinators is the loss of honey bee colonies, with just over 23% reported lost last winter."
"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Aug 04, 2011  The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee. From the booklet, the southeastern blueberry bee (Habropoda laboriosa) visiting blossoms of a rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum). When I was a kid, there was one category for bees – “the stinging kind.” Fear of being stung wouldn’t allow me to consider variations among the swarms that patrolled playgrounds. The only thing that made bees tolerable was … the honey. Youthfully ignorant, I didn’t know that there are thousands of bee species (and some bee species are stingless) or that those bees on the playgrounds were more life saving than threatening. The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bees to educate the public and encourage people to help protect these essential insects. The 40-page booklet primarily focuses on bees native to North America, of which there are 4,000 species, found in forests, farms, cities, wildlands and deserts.  Although honey bees may be most noted for producing honey, the booklet explains that native bees are valued for pollinating plants. The USDA Forest Service, along with Pollinator Partnership, has produced a booklet called Bee Basics: An Introduction to our Native Bee. From the booklet, two female Morrison's bumble bees (Bombus morrisoni) sonicate the pollen from pored-anthers of a garden tomato.  “Much of the produce we eat is pollinated by bees,” said Larry Stritch, a USDA Forest Service National Botanist. “They pollinate about 75 percent of the fruits and vegetables grown in the (United States) and 80 percent of flowering plants. Take away bees and you greatly decrease our food source and food for animals.” According to “Bee Basics,” ground nesting bees provide food to wildlife and aerate and enrich soil.    The North American bumble bee, characterized by their relatively large, black, furry bodies and bright stripes, may be most familiar to Americans. There are about 50 species of bumble bees, which are important pollinators of tomatoes and clovers, a forage crop for cattle. Bumble bees are among the Apidae family of bees, which also include native carpenter, squash and cuckoo bees, and nonnative stingless, orchid and honey bees. Honey bees are the only natural source of honey that’s healthy for humans. Brought to America from Europe, honey bees don’t pollinate native plants as effectively as native bees. Along with information about a variety of bees, “Bee Basics” also contains pages of glossy, color illustrations of bees and plants. The booklet’s key message warns of the threat to native-bee survival that is posed by pesticides, competition for nectar from honey bees, and environmental destruction. To learn more about native bees, read “Bee Basics” on the Forest Service website.

"District Wildlife Biologist, Region 5 Naturewatch Coordinator, Scott Salmon River Ranger District in  Forestry  Initiatives  Apr 23, 2010   In 1999, Yreka High School in Yreka, California received funds from a Forest Service Grant (Partners in Flight Program) to enhance their agriculture and natural resource program and provide wildlife habitat on school grounds. These funds were used to build a songbird garden, purchase fencing, materials for an irrigation system, and a greenhouse structure. The students and instructors constructed the fence, irrigation system and the greenhouse. The Songbird Garden Portion of the Yreka Community was funded by Partners in Flight Program. Then in the spring of 2009, the Siskiyou Gardens, Parks and Greenway Association (SGPGA) partnered with Yreka High School to develop a community garden and greenhouse. The Yreka Garden Club also agreed to help maintain the greenhouse in exchange for growing space. These organizations along with a number of community volunteers pulled their enthusiasm and resources together to make this project a reality. In a few short months they leveled the site, built the raised beds, fixed the fence and irrigation system, and started thousands of seedlings inside the greenhouse. Much of the heavy work was donated by members of the California Conservation Corps and some materials were donated by local businesses. The success of this community garden is the result of many enthusiastic volunteers. Approximately 25 beds were constructed as well as a flower beds to attract pollinators. The grand opening of this People’s Garden was May 3, 2009.  Festivities included a ribbon-cutting ceremony, old-time music, a plant sale, and gardening workshops. The garden was teeming with enthusiasm through the summer, and by September many hundreds of pounds of fruit and vegetables were ready to be harvested and donations were made to Yreka Senior Center, Yreka Hospice, Grange Hall Community Hot Meals Program, and Yreka Community Food Bank.  Through these organizations produce was made available to an estimated 300-350 people. Six workshops were held here on topics related to gardening, greenhouses, starting seed, and food preservation. This spring and summer the Yreka Community Garden will be hold free classes on permiculture, greenhouse plantings, composting and mulching, and canning. Special thanks goes to their partners! Members of the California Conservation Corps (CCC) volunteered their services for a variety of work including clean up, construction of the raised beds and setting fresh gravel in the greenhouse. The Ford Family Foundation Leadership Training Group is sponsoring the construction of an outdoor classroom/gazebo. This structure is a special project led by a local leadership training class which has been fund-raising for this project for 7 months.  This project has received much support from local contributors including Rotary Club and in kind contributions from local contractors. The Yreka Community Garden will also be developing a Children's Garden that will feature educational planting beds, small water fountain/bird bath, butterfly garden, willow tunnel, native American cedar plank house, and benches and paths. This is being developed by an active community group including U.S. Forest Service biologists, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists, local teachers, child development specialists, and local gardeners.

"What is the Nine Agency Rule? The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights (OASCR) enforces the Nine Agency Rule under the authority delegated by the Secretary of Agriculture, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. § 2.25 (a)(1)(3). The Nine Agency Rule is designed to ensure that USDA programs of civil rights, including program delivery, compliance, and equal employment opportunity, adhere to all governing laws, rules, and regulations, including related Executive Orders and Congressional mandates. On February 14, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed Executive Order 14015, establishing the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, emphasizing the importance of partnering with civil society, including faith-based and secular organizations, to serve people in need while adhering to all governing laws. This Executive Order revoked Executive Order 13831 and reinstated key provisions to protect religious liberty. Key Provisions of the Nine Agency Rule  Equal Access for Faith-Based Organizations  Under 7 CFR § 16, faith-based organizations are eligible to access and participate in USDA assistance programs on the same basis as any other organization. USDA and its intermediaries must not discriminate against or for an organization based on its religious character, motives, affiliation, or lack thereof.  Non-Discrimination Against Beneficiaries  Organizations receiving direct or indirect Federal financial assistance from USDA must not discriminate against current or prospective beneficiaries based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.  Separation of Religious Activities  Organizations that receive USDA direct assistance must separate any explicitly religious activities in time or location from the programs or services funded by USDA direct assistance, ensuring participation in such activities is voluntary. This restriction does not apply to indirect Federal financial assistance.  Notification Requirements  Recipients administering USDA social service programs must notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their right to be free from religious discrimination and how to report violations.  Alternative Providers  If a beneficiary objects to the religious character of a faith-based provider, the USDA awarding agency must make reasonable efforts to refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider.  Protections for Faith-Based Providers  Faith-based providers can compete equally with secular organizations for USDA awards while retaining their religious character, provided they comply with all applicable regulations. Examples of Nine Agency Rule Violations  Denied Service Based on Religious Beliefs  A food pantry volunteer denies service to an individual wearing a religious head covering and makes derogatory remarks about their faith.  Discriminatory Practices by Service Providers  A service provider receiving USDA funds denies services to a homeowner based on their perceived religion, using offensive language, and failing to address the discrimination. How to File a Complaint Any individual who believes they have been discriminated against based on religion, religious belief, refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice may file a complaint with OASCR.

"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication, and Larry Stritch, U.S. Forest Service National Botanist in  Forestry  May 03, 2012  Wildflower displays of blue Wasatch Penstemon and white Nuttall’s linanthus wildflowers bloom in the subalpine meadows of Albion Basin on the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest from mid-July through early August.  As spring begins across the nation, fields are turning green – and pastel pink, flaming scarlet, electric orange, brilliant yellow, deep violet and florescent blue.   Wildflowers are abloom!  This year, the Forest Service has released an updated wildflower map with 317 viewing areas to choose from on America’s national forests and grasslands.  In addition to locations, information is also provided on the best time for peak viewing. Yellow fritillaries are some of the first plants to bloom after the snow melts and are found in the western United States.  “Every year we continue to add new wildflower viewing areas,” said Larry Stritch, the U.S. Forest Service National Botanist.  “This year, we have updated the map so visitors can search by geographical region, state or national forest or grassland.  This makes it easier to plan day trips or extended journeys to enjoy the colorful displays of Mother Nature’s catalog of wildflowers.” Due to an extremely mild winter, an early spring is appearing in many areas and wildflower season has begun.  The pageantry begins with spring ephemerals such as bloodroot, Virginia bluebells, and squirrel corn.   Spring ephemerals are woodland wildflowers which appear in early spring, flower, set seed, and then die back to their underground parts before the trees unfurl their leaves. Other spring wildflowers seen in early spring include wild gingers, hepaticas, and trilliums. In late summer and early fall, the last wildflowers of the year begin to flower including asters, sunflowers, goldenrods, cardinal flower and gentians. Red columbine begin flowering in early spring in a cascade of blooms from the southern states on the Gulf of Mexico north into Canada.  The updated map includes a narrative for each viewing area which describes the area’s botanical habitat and wildflowers types that can be found by season, as well as recommendations for the best time of year to visit.  Safety advisories such as animal habitats, clothing recommendations, insect or plant cautions, and traffic and parking tips are provided.  Directions to the site, the closest town and contacts for more information are also offered. The map is part of the agency’s Celebrating Wildflowers web site which includes more than 10,000 plant images and over 1,500 pages of information about the aesthetic, recreational, biological, medicinal, and economic values of native plants as well how to conserve native plant habitats.

"APHIS Wildlife Biologists Aid Squirrel Recovery on the Delmarva  Many claim that 2020 has been a year of chaos and calamity, but for one rare squirrel, it might be a year of hope and new beginnings. The Delmarva Fox Squirrel (DFS) is a subspecies of fox squirrel found on the eastern shore of Maryland, Southern Delaware and Virginia. This pudgy, slow squirrel with its signature size and silvery-white coat has become a conservation success story in Maryland. Habitat loss along with other additive factors landed them on the Federal endangered species list in 1967. Protection and management efforts benefited DFS and in 2015, populations reached stable limits and they were officially delisted in Maryland. In parts of Delaware, DFS populations were not as prolific and numbers began to dwindle over time leaving only a few small populations.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service-Florida Plant Materials Center in  Conservation  Animals  Plants  May 08, 2014  In northern Florida wildflowers are planted in an unused part of this farm field to provide habitat for pollinators. USDA photo. No matter what part of the country you grew up in, most of us have fond childhood memories of the wildflowers that sprung up each year around our homes, parks and roadsides. For many, this fondness has carried into our adult years. This week, we celebrate National Wildflower Week as a way to share our interest and to increase public awareness for wildflowers in the landscape. The beauty of wildflowers can indeed stir up memories of a certain place or time. But the wildflowers that are native to a particular place also serve an important function in the ecology of that place. Native wildflowers are those species that were already growing in an area before settlers came and planted their favorite flowers from their homelands. Plants that are native to an area are better adapted to the local growing conditions than non-native ones. They are generally easier to establish, require less water and fertilizer and are more tolerant of the pests and diseases found in that area. Many populations of native wildflowers have been lost because of urban development, competition from invasive plant species and some modern farming practices. We’ve learned that agriculture can benefit from native wildflowers. Patches of wildflowers located adjacent to crop fields can attract insects and other types of wildlife that in turn pollinate the crop and increase yields. In fact, more than a third of the world’s food crops are dependent on pollinators to produce fruit. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is working to combat this decline of wildflowers by promoting planting of them on farms and ranches. Several of the Farm Bill programs that NRCS administers have specific financial incentives tied to planting wildflowers. NRCS also maintains a national network of Plant Materials Centers that can provide information on which native wildflowers to plant to improve pollinator habitat and guidance on recommended methods for establishing and maintaining wildflower plantings. At the Plant Materials Center where I work, we recently partnered with the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation to track flowering periods of several native wildflowers. This information is being used to help develop seeding mixes for attracting pollinators to crops grown in Florida. Flowering periods of the crop and the wildflowers that we plan to use to attract pollinators must be in sync for successful pollination to occur. The information we gather can help determine the best wildflower species for farmers to plant in field borders, contour buffer strips and other conservation practices to ensure pollination of their crops.

"A Reflection: Celebrating Eight Years of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships  Looking back at USDA’s efforts to help rural America thrive, I am truly proud of the impact our diverse partners, both from faith and secular communities, have had within their communities. On behalf of the USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, I would like to say thank you to our partners these past eight years as well as reflect on a few notable highlights of the work we have achieved together. USDA touches the lives of all Americans every day, whether they realize it or not.

"People’s Garden Intern in  Conservation  Initiatives  May 28, 2010   Today, the People’s Garden hosted a workshop about composting. Pat Millner, who has done a lot of research on composting and utilizing compost at the USDA-Agricultural Research Service’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Maryland, taught it. It was fantastically fun and informative, and Pat brought in several examples of composters for us to see. She informed us that composting isn’t as complicated as it might seem. Composts work because microorganisms break down the material, and these microorganisms need three things to be healthy, happy and produce lots of compost: food, air, and water. If compost contains these three principles, it will be fruitful. If you are looking to start a composter, the best season to start it is the fall. First, you need a bin. Layer about 4” of sticks (from any type of tree or shrub) in the bottom of the bin, this will provide good air flow and ventilation for the microorganisms and the compost. In your lawn, let your grass grow a little bit taller, and let the leaves fall too. Take your lawnmower and go over the area, catching the leaf/grass mix in a bag. You can put this mix in the bin, and let it take care of itself! What about those of us who live in a condo or apartment and don’t have a lawn, or just want a smaller compost? Try a vermicomposter. A vermicomposter uses worms to break down material into compost. You can “feed” the worms in the composter veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds and filters, crushed eggshells, shredded office paper, and even dryer lint. However, the worms aren’t fond of citrus fruits. Meat and dairy products should always stay out of composts too, the smell may attract some unwanted critters. The worms will consume what you feed them, and there’s no need to worry about them escaping. Their castings (a fancy way to say worm poop) make for very healthy compost! Before, when I heard about compost, the only use I knew was to enrich soil. Compost is used for much more! Runoff can create erosion and sweep away the healthy topsoil in many areas. A compost sock is a material that is filled with compost, and can be put on the side of a sloping hill, for example, to provide a filter for runoff rainwater. This can filter out any unwanted silt and even oil. Compost has also been added to places where chemicals or lead have contaminated the soil, causing plant life to die off; there, compost enriches the soil again and also blocks the harmful chemicals from being absorbed by the plants. If you’re looking for more information on composting, take a look at The People’s Garden Healthy Workshop handout on composting. It’s a great resource. Start a worm composter with newspaper or shredded office paper as bedding and about one pound of redworms.

"A Small Business Dream Built on a Farmers Market  My mom raised five kids, taught high school chemistry for 15 years and then retired back to the family farm in 1986. Her new life on the farm depended on the Salisbury, MD farmers market where she sold daylilies.  The farmers market, just one of 8,000 or more markets listed in USDA’s National Farmers Market Directory, gave her the opportunity she needed to start her own business. Each Saturday she loaded up her station wagon with plants and drove into town, displaying the lilies by color.  When she wanted to expand her plant offerings, my brother built her a small greenhouse.  She became known as the farmers market’s Flower Lady.

"Focusing on the Future of Food Assistance  USDA’s food assistance and development programs serve a dual purpose: to meet the immediate needs of hungry people, and to show their countries how to rejuvenate their agricultural sectors and increase their capacity to trade. We accomplish these goals in cooperation with other U.S. government agencies and with private-sector partners ranging from non-governmental organizations to research institutions to agribusinesses. And we are always looking for ways to be more effective. So this week, at the International Food Aid and Development Conference (IFADC) in Kansas City, we got back to basics, discussing steps we are taking to operate our international aid programs more efficiently to ensure that program dollars go directly to eliminating hunger and poverty. We focused on how USDA can strengthen our partnerships with academia and international relief and development groups, as well as with local and international companies. After all, these organizations have the know-how and expertise that allows USDA to leverage limited funding to make a broad and enduring impact.

"Director, Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center in  Forestry  Feb 10, 2012   When the first Europeans settled in what is now the United States, they found a continent of extensive wildlands. In less than 500 years, the undeveloped nature of these wildlands has been reduced significantly. As they became increasingly scarce and a fledgling conservation movement lost natural treasures like Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley to development, Americans began to appreciate their value. View of the Sawtooth Range in Idaho. U.S. Forest Service photo. With passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, a new course in history was chartered -- to preserve some of the country's last remaining wild places and protect their natural processes and values from development. The interagency Arthur Carhart National Wilderness Training Center, located in Missoula, Mont., was created in 1993 to empower federal agency employees and the public to preserve their wilderness heritage through training, information and education. It has become a critical resource for land managers from the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service as they manage more than 109 million acres of designated wilderness from Alaska to Puerto Rico. The center’s staff of seven works with experts within and outside the agencies to develop comprehensive interagency solutions to critical stewardship issues. Materials are distributed electronically to each of the 792 units comprising America's National Wilderness Preservation System, and training is offered where it is most needed. Most recently, in collaboration with the Aldo Leopold Wilderness Research Institute and the Wilderness Institute at the University of Montana, the center conducted a webinar called The Foundation and Qualities of Wilderness Character. This interactive, collaborative approach to training and coaching ensures that the Carhart Center continues providing training and information that employees need, when they need it, so that they can keep wilderness wild.

"Research in Energy Security Helps Lead to Food Security in West Africa  Research shows the majority of people in Africa depend on biomass to meet their energy needs, with approximately 80 percent relying on wood energy. Such high dependency makes families vulnerable to unexpected and sudden changes, including extreme weather and socio-political events. Researching and developing ways to diversify energy sources is crucial for a more sustainable, food secure future. A project funded through the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) Cochran Fellowship Program on “Biofuels for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods,” hosted by the University of Missouri (MU) College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources International Programs, set out to address this very issue. The research and training program was organized for West African Cochran Fellows to learn how different uses of biofuels can help support sustainable livelihoods in their communities.

Halfway around the world, a farmer in India stands proudly in the winner’s circle with his cow. Mr. S. Sukharpreet Singh Rode, the farmer, is a 2008 graduate of the Cochran Fellowship Program, an educational exchange program administered by USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS). As a Cochran fellow, Mr. Rode spent two weeks at the University of Wisconsin learning about innovative techniques on animal husbandry, improved feeding practices, animal diseases and treatments, and calf rearing. With this background, Mr. Rode returned to India, where he used high-quality American dairy cattle genetics to improve his dairy business in the Punjab region, one of the most fertile areas in India. The cow in the winner’s circle with Mr. Rode is one of his American-origin Holstein crosses (crossed with a local Indian cow), and in February it won a milk production award at the Progressive Dairy Farmers Association show near Ludhiana. India is the world’s largest dairy producer and maintains the world’s largest dairy herd. Given population and income growth in India, Indian farmers are now looking for new management tools and technologies to increase local production and meet growing demand. U.S. cattle genetics are well adapted to Indian farming practices and are already providing significant milk yield increases for Indian farmers. Working closely with the FAS office in New Delhi, India, American genetics companies are helping India build its genetics technology. At the same time, the United States will benefit from a new market for American cattle genetics exports, which holds potential for significant growth. The FAS Cochran Program, which gave Mr. Rode the training he needed to improve his business, provides U.S.-based agricultural training opportunities for agriculture professionals like Mr. Rode from foreign countries. To be selected for the program, fellows must be senior or mid-level specialists and administrators from public and private sectors concerned with agricultural trade, agribusiness development, management, policy, and marketing. In the end, the Cochran Fellowship Program helps to support U.S. exports and build long-term relationships with trading partners.

The program has provided collaborative research opportunities for 190 Fellows in Africa since 2004, six of which were from Zambia.  These individuals have been trained in areas such as agricultural economics, food safety and risk analysis, communication technologies and crop breeding mechanisms. The Cochran Fellowship Program provides high-quality training to improve local agricultural systems and strengthen and enhance trade links with the United States.  Participants are middle and senior-level professionals from both the public and private sectors who are concerned with agricultural trade, agribusiness development, management, policy, and marketing.  The program has provided training in topics including food safety, biotechnology and animal disease surveillance for 1,330 public and private sector participants from sub-Saharan Africa since 1984. The USDA believes that institution-to-institution capacity building is an important way to build relationships to strengthen our bilateral ties.  The Cochran and Borlaug Fellowship Programs are two prime examples of how the United States and Africa collaborate on a variety of agricultural activities that help promote two-way trade and food security.

"USDA Celebrates Rural Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs During National Small Business Week  National Small Business Week began yesterday with a proclamation from President Obama recognizing the small businesses across the Nation which, especially in our rural and small-town communities, making vital contributions to communities and the American economy. Individually, the impact of a small business may seem minor in comparison with conglomerates. The Small Business Administration (SBA), however, estimates that more than half of our American workforce either owns or is employed by a small business, and two out of every three new jobs in the U.S. each year is created by--you guessed it--a small business. It’s clear this portion of economy is significant, but in rural towns and areas where each job and transaction has an effect on the community, small business is essential.  In rural America, the entrepreneurs, mom-and-pop shops, agri-businesses, small-scale manufacturers, and other enterprises are the local economy.

"Agriculture Secretary Vilsack Views Recovery Act Project that Improves the Environment and Creates Jobs in Maryland  The U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack visited the town of Berlin, Maryland, Monday to check up on the upgrades that are taking place to improve the Berlin Wastewater Treatment Plant. Secretary Vilsack is the highest-ranking federal official to visit the town since Franklin D. Roosevelt was there in the 1930s.  The Secretary spoke to the people of Berlin in front of the Atlantic Hotel about the status of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The technology that the Town of Berlin is installing as a part of that act was made possible thanks to a grant and some low interest Water and Environmental Program loans from the USDA. These upgrades will help to remove the pathogens, nutrients and other pollutants from the influent.  The renovation and expansion that the USDA is funding will increase the capacity at the plant to 750,000 gallons each day and make the facility compliant with current Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) Standards.

"Water Quality Trading in the Chesapeake Bay  Last fall, USDA brought together a group of Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) awardees, state policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in one of the most challenging nutrient management initiatives in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed: enabling water quality trading markets. Water quality trading offers flexibility to those required to improve water quality in the Bay: power plants, wastewater treatment plants, new developments, and agricultural producers, among others. It allows those facing high costs of water quality improvement to reduce those costs, working with farmers to improve water quality on their behalf, thus providing farmers with additional income streams and the opportunity to significantly increase the scope of conservation practices on their land.

"in  USDA Results  Initiatives  Energy  Food and Nutrition  Technology  Jan 26, 2011   Last night I had the privilege of attending President Obama’s State of the Union speech.  In it, he laid out some of the challenges America faces moving forward as we compete with nations across the globe to win the future. The President’s vision is simple.  We need to be a nation that makes, creates and innovates so that we can expand the middle class and ensure that we pass along to our children the types of freedoms, opportunities and experiences that we have enjoyed. At USDA, we share the Administration’s commitment to creating jobs and revitalizing our economy. We are driving innovation, promoting the production of renewable energy, which is creating jobs in rural America, helping our environment and decreasing our dependence on foreign oil.  We are helping provide a better education for America’s children, making the most important changes to school meals in decades so that our kids will be at their best and ready to learn in class.  We are building critical infrastructure, bringing access to high speed broadband internet to millions of rural Americans to help drive job creation and lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth. USDA also shares the President’s belief that we need to take responsibility for our deficit and reform our government so that it’s leaner and smarter for the 21st century. Last year we saved $6 billion through the negotiation of a new agreement for crop insurance, $4 billion of which will go to pay down the federal deficit.  And agencies across the Department have looked for ways to reform the way they do business – from reducing the number of visits a farmer has to make to our offices to get conservation services, to saving millions in taxpayer dollars by operating our food assistance programs with historic levels of accuracy. And American agriculture has embraced these same values for years.  Our farmers and ranchers are problem solvers.  Time and time again, they’ve adapted, embracing science and new technology that have allowed them to produce about twice as much per acre as their grandfathers did 50 years ago.  Growers educate their children, build impressive operations.  And – particularly in recent years – they have carried very little debt relative to the rest of the economy.  These values are all part of why American agriculture has seen a strong and rapid rebound from the recession. Last night, the President told us that winning the future will require a lot of hard work and sacrifice from everyone.  But if our farmers and ranchers can do it – I know our nation can as well.  Working together, we can build a foundation for American competiveness for years to come so that we pass on a stronger America to our children and grandchildren.

"Conservation  Jun 22, 2010  On Friday, I was pleased to be part of unveiling the latest step in the Obama Administration’s strategy for restoring the Chesapeake Bay with the announcement of three Showcase Watershed projects in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. The Showcase Watershed pilot projects will demonstrate what can be accomplished by bringing people, sound science and funding together to solve natural resource problems in a targeted area. USDA and our partners are helping farmers within the Showcase Watersheds implement voluntary conservation practices to reduce nutrient and sediment runoff. This matters, because all of the water that enters waterways from local farms in the watersheds eventually ends up in the Bay. Successful approaches learned in Showcase areas can serve as models for restoring ecosystems elsewhere in the country. A thriving and sustainable agricultural sector is essential to the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, so the announcement of the Showcase Watersheds was made from a working farm in each State. I was honored to attend the launch event in Pennsylvania at the Eby-Patterson farm in Hershey, where the owners raise beef cattle and are excellent stewards of their natural resources.  We had the opportunity to examine the positive changes in the Conewago Creek that runs through their property.  With experts from our Natural Resources Conservation Service on hand we examined the aquatic life that is thriving in the creek and talked with the Patterson family about their efforts to contribute to a healthier watershed.All three watersheds—Smith Creek in Virginia, Upper Chester River in Maryland and Conewago Creek in Pennsylvania—include a wide diversity of agriculture, allowing for a number of different approaches to conservation. In every case, though, USDA is coordinating with numerous partners from local, state and federal government, non-profit organizations and private organizations to reach out to 100 percent of land owners. We rely on our nation’s working lands for sustenance, economic health and cultural heritage, not to mention beautiful and satisfying landscapes like the one I was privileged to visit on Friday.   The focused work we do in the Showcase Watersheds—added to the extensive conservation efforts already in place to restore the Bay—will strengthen both the region and U.S. agriculture overall, enhancing both productivity and sustainability. We are proud to be partners in this critical effort.  Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan looks over the creek at the farm of Mrs. Eby-Patterson and husband, Daniel.

"An Airport is No Place for an Owl  Seeing a short-eared owl in November on the Pittsburgh International Airport, where I work as an airport wildlife biologist, was a unique occasion. However, as the number of owls grew to eight, I recognized the challenge ahead:  Like all birds of prey, short-eared owls are a recognized potential aviation hazard. Their low rolling flight and difficult-to-disperse reputation means they pose an aviation safety threat.  From 1990-2012, short-eared owl strikes with aircraft in the United States caused over $1 million in damage, and often are fatal to the birds.  Convincing them to leave would be difficult but important. The task would be harder because short-eared owls are listed by the State as an endangered species.  Common in many areas globally, Pennsylvania is the southernmost edge of their breeding range.  These owls likely migrated from Canadian breeding grounds to winter in Pennsylvania.

With all the success of HHFKA, now is not the time to intentionally go backwards on nutrition standards in healthier school meals and to block access to these meals for millions of children. In January, the Senate Agriculture Committee unanimously took a bipartisan step toward reauthorizing critical child nutrition programs like school lunch and breakfast. Rather than diminish the progress we’ve already made, the Senate's bill ensures these improvements to our children's diets will continue.  The bipartisan Senate bill represents a compromise that allows us to stop rehashing old debates and secures a healthier future for our kids. It represents a win for children, parents, schools, and our country's future. In contrast, the House Education and Workforce Committee’s bill aims to weaken one of the most successful aspects of HHFKA. The Community Eligibility Provision (CEP), which allows high-poverty schools or districts to serve all students free meals without any burdensome paperwork, has been lauded for increasing student participation, reducing administrative burdens and costs on schools, cutting down on paperwork for busy parents, and improving program integrity. But the House bill would place new limitations on the number of schools in high-poverty areas that qualify for CEP, forcing many high-poverty schools to lose eligibility. This would cause school meal participation to fall dramatically, and schools would be forced to spend more time on paperwork and less time focusing on feeding kids. And some children who need free meals may slip through the cracks. The House bill would also roll back the school meal nutrition standards and gut the Smart Snacks in School rule, which ensures that all snack foods and beverages for sale to students during the school day are nutritious. Under the House bill, school vending machines could go back to selling soda and junk food.  Schools have already invested time and effort into making the switch to healthier options.  The snack food industry has innovated and developed hundreds of new products that meet the requirements and are popular with students.  Now is not the time to regress. We are proud of the way the school meals program provides flexibility for schools to tailor the programs to their local needs. For example, schools design their own menus and have the ability to serve items they know their students prefer.  They can also choose options like CEP and serve afterschool snacks and suppers if they are the right fit for their local community. However, in the name of local flexibility, some are considering a proposal to convert the school nutrition programs into a block grant. That is a very dangerous idea. Not only would it put further strain on state and local school districts’ budgets, but it would jeopardize children’s access to quality, healthy school meals no matter where they live. Instead, we are working with schools and districts to ensure their programs meet their needs. One example is the Team Up For School Nutrition Success training. Along with the Institute of Child Nutrition, we offer all state agencies the opportunity to host local events to provide tailored technical assistance, support, and best practices for schools in administering successful meals programs. During the training, schools cover topics like menu planning, financial management, procurement, meal presentation and appeal, as well as youth engagement tactics and strategies to reduce plate waste. Schools have the opportunity to learn from each other in order to make positive strides toward providing healthy school environments with financial stability and strong student participation. With all these strides being made, now is not the time to eliminate the successful partnership between the federal government and state agencies, putting further strain on state and local school districts’ budgets. It would be unwise to roll back the school meal standards and I urge Congress to stay the course for sake of our children. USDA looks forward to working with Congress, schools, parents and communities to continue to improve the health and wellbeing of the next generation.

"Under Secretary, Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 16, 2016  For more than 40 years, USDA has been committed to closing the food security gap that occurs in the summer months when children no longer have access to the nutritious meals they’re offered in school. As I travel across the country visiting our nation’s summer meals sites, I am proud of the commitment we’ve collectively made to nourish both the bodies and minds of our country’s children and teens. Schools, recreation centers, places of worship, libraries and other community sites have generously opened their doors to ensure kids receive healthy, balanced meals during the summer months – a time when many low-income families struggle to provide their children nutritious meals and snacks each and every day. At USDA we’ve long recognized summer as a vulnerable time for kids and have been focused on closing the food security gap that occurs during the months when school is out of session.  Since 2009, more than 1.2 billion meals have been served through the Summer Meal Programs, fueling kids and teens throughout the summer and helping to ensure they are healthy and ready to learn when the school year begins. In support of these same goals, the White House announced earlier this year the Summer Opportunity Project, a multi-agency initiative to expand opportunities for young people through the summer.  The initiative aims to increase the participation of youth in evidence-based summer opportunity programs and make sure young Americans have the support they need to get their first job. USDA’s Summer Meal Programs play an important role in achieving this mission. By ensuring the most basic need of good nutrition is met, kids and teens in eligible communities can more easily pursue and leverage summer opportunities.  Many sites offer not only healthy meals and snacks, but also host physical and enrichment activities to keep kids engaged and coming back day after day.  By including free and low-cost activities into Summer Meal Programs, sites boost attendance and make the meal service more fun for children, their families, and volunteers.  To support these efforts, this spring USDA published Summer Food, Summer Moves to help sites and sponsors offer ideas on engaging kids, teens, and their families. Increasing the number of meals served through the Summer Meal Programs has been a rewarding achievement during my time at FNS, as each meal served elevates the life of a child or teen in our country.   With the help of our creative and hardworking volunteers, sponsors and partners, we were able to serve more than 190 million meals last summer.  Groups like Fuel Up to Play 60, Feeding America, Catholic Charities, United Way, and First Book have all played a key part in providing access to summer meals for children living in areas with high food insecurity.  Engaging the community in summer meals is also integral to the success of the program.  These programs allow communities to take a lead role in preventing hunger and focus their efforts where there is increased need.

"USDA Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 30, 2016   Cross-posted from the Disability.gov blog: Your neighborhood grocer may be conveniently located just a few short blocks away. But for many persons with disabilities and the elderly participating in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the store might as well be on the other side of the world. It’s a difficult problem that USDA’s new homebound food delivery pilot aims to alleviate, not just for the more than 4 million nonelderly adults with disabilities participating in SNAP, but also for the nearly 5 million seniors, who often face similar challenges and who may face disabilities, as well. USDA recently announced the food purchasing and delivery firms selected to take part in the one-year pilot, which will be conducted in locations nationwide, perhaps at a location near you. Firms selected include Denver Food Rescue (Denver, Colo.), Lutheran Social Services of Nevada (Las Vegas, N.V.), Many Infinities, Inc. (Alabaster, Ala.), Senior Services of Alexandria (Alexandria, Va.), and Store to Door (Roseville, Minn.). The pilots break new ground for USDA. For the first time, governmental and non-profit food purchasing and delivery services will be allowed to accept SNAP benefits as payment. This is expected to increase the opportunities for home delivery to those unable to shop for food. I think it’s important to note that during the trial period participating firms will only be permitted to accept SNAP benefits from households where the qualifying person with disabilities or elderly person is the head of household. This is intended to ensure that the pilot focuses on households that have the most limited access to foods. Given that nearly one in five SNAP participants is either elderly or a person with disabilities, it’s clear that we must address the special challenges faced by these groups. Lessons we learn during the pilot will help USDA shape final rules now in development, which is an important step forward, as I see it. Home delivery of groceries will help ensure that those unable to shop for food themselves have access to the nutritious foods we all need to maintain a healthy diet.

Anne Arundel County Public Schools in Maryland understand this harsh reality and have taken steps to keep children fed during the summer months. This week Under Secretary for Food Safety, Elisabeth Hagen and I visited one of their schools, Maryland City Elementary in Laurel, to help announce their plan to offer free meals through USDA’s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) to all neighborhood kids, ages 2-18. What a fantastic way to alleviate hunger and strengthen the overall health of their community.  The SFSP is, designed to do just that, fill the nutrition gap during summer, by providing children free meals and snacks at registered feeding sites. Did you know that during the regular school year, at least 20 million children or more nationwide receive free and reduced-priced meals through the National School Lunch Program?  Yet little more than 3 million kids are fed in our summer programs -- not very good statistics. But we continue to work to increase those numbers.  This summer, Let’s Move! Faith and Communities (part of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative) is working with partners to host new feeding sites at congregations and neighborhood organizations.

USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. USDA is also funding numerous pilot projects in several states to test new ways to feed hungry children during summer. All of these efforts move us closer to our goal to end childhood hunger in this country – a goal I know we all can share and work towards together.  Summer months are critical; make no mistake, because hunger leaves children susceptible to illness and other health issues that make it harder for them to learn when school begins again. So we have to act now to ensure that our most vulnerable children are fed during summer so they too can grow up nutritionally healthy, academically strong, and best able to fulfill their dreams.   Healthy Students, Healthy Schools, Cultivating Communities of Wellness was the theme of the event at Maryland City Elementary. The county’s supervisor for Food and Nutrition Services, Jodi Risse, was instrumental in getting Maryland City Elementary and Hilltop Elementary in Glen Burnie to offer community feeding this summer.  Her hope this summer is to double the number of children served and she said it best, “to keep our kids fed, nourished and ready to learn when they come back to school next year.” Please follow USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service on Twitter for the latest on ending hunger and nutrition assistance programs.

Marla Emery looks at plantain – an ordinary weed to most people – with an eye on how some people will use it. After all, her work with the U.S. Forest Service as a research geographer leads her to interesting conversations with people who forage in rural and urban forests. “On a good day, one of those people will take me out in the forest and we will walk around and pick up things that we can eat or use for medicine or use for something else,” she said. “They talk to me about how they see that forest and how they use that forest throughout the year. “A great deal of my work is done sitting in people’s kitchens talking to them. It is amazing. It’s truly wonderful. I never go into someone’s kitchen where they do not give me something to eat or drink while they are sharing all kinds of information with me.” Emery works in the agency’s Research and Development’s People and Their Environments unit in Burlington, Vt. She said her research has shown that no matter a person’s social or economic status, the connection to nature is the deep. “People are just passionate about their ability to go out into the forest or in the open spaces and interact immediately and directly with nature,” she said. “It creates deep, intimate relationships between people and places, people and ecosystems. Understanding those relationships tells us something important about how people and ecosystems interact.” Find out more about Emery and her research in Faces of the Forest, a bi-weekly feature of the U.S. Forest Service’s Office of Communication that showcases the people, places and professions in the agency.

"Under Secretary, Food Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 16, 2013   Making sure children have nutritious meals and keep their bodies moving all year long is one of USDA’s most important missions. Our Summer Food Service Program plays an important role in ensuring that all children get healthy meals during the summertime.    We’re proud to say that in 2012, our partners helped to serve 144 million summer meals at 38,800 sites across the country. That translates to 2.3 million children served on a typical summer day. But there is still a lot of work to be done. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of kids who rely on free and reduced price meals during the school year participate in the summer program. So this year we’ve set out to serve 5 million more summer meals. We need your help to meet that goal. On Friday, Secretary Vilsack held a roundtable with anti-hunger advocates from Share Our Strength, Hunger Free Colorado, and the state of Arkansas to encourage more organizations to work with us as sponsor sites. During the discussion, he reiterated how important it is for advocates and leaders in communities across the country to redouble their efforts to address the summer meals gap.  Click here to listen to the roundtable. After the discussion, we hosted a twitter chat through our account, @USDANutrition, to spread the word about summer meals and what we’re trying to accomplish. One of things I mentioned during the chat is that we want to increase participation by eligible kids in summer meals in every community that needs it, but we’re paying particular attention to states with great need like Arkansas, California, Colorado, Rhode Island and Virginia. As the Secretary said, poor nutrition during summer months can set up a cycle of poor performance once school starts up again in the fall. So what can you personally do to help?  There are many ways to be a part of preventing summer hunger. One of the best things you can do is help us increase the number of sponsors who provide free meals and activities to eligible low-income children. Churches, schools, government agencies, camps and other local organizations can act as sponsor sites.  Those sites also often need volunteers to lead fun activities or provide transportation. The best thing to do is visit our Summer Food Service Web page and start thinking about how you can best contribute. With strong support from individuals, communities and partners nationwide we can reach more disadvantaged kids with nutritious meals when school is out.

"FSA Windham County Executive Director in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 03, 2011   Last week, we welcomed Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan to Vermont as she toured farms to see recovery efforts after Tropical Storm Irene. Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan speaking with farmers at the Robb Family Farm near Brattleboro, VT. Our first stop was the Wheeler Farm, a 100 acre 50-cow grass based farm just north of Wilmington, one of the hardest hit communities in the state.  Visible water marks were higher than the historic flood of 1927 and hurricane of 1938.  The group welcomed Deputy Secretary Merrigan on the porch of the historic farmhouse, which had just escaped the flood waters by a few inches.  As we pulled onto the farm’s access road, a large grader and dump truck continued work to repair washed away segments. Rob and Karen Wheeler explained how they were humbled by the outpouring of support from their neighbors to quickly clean up and bring back their large field.  Rob also told the Deputy Secretary of his positive experiences and support for the local USDA staff.  She spoke of the signs she saw in Wilmington that read “Courage” and “Thank you for your support,” and even one advertising “Floodstock,” a benefit concert for disaster relief. She remarked on the resilience of the Vermont farmers and of course, farmers as a group, and also spoke of the challenges ahead for USDA and its programs. Our next stop was the Harlow Farm in Westminster, an 80 acre organic vegetable farm with a successful farm store and wholesale business. We were welcomed by owner-operator Paul Harlow who is well respected and widely known for his extensive crop knowledge.  About 30 vegetable and dairy producers came to speak with the Deputy, along with Vermont Agriculture Secretary Chuck Ross who had been assessing crop damage and meeting with farmers in another county.  Paul Harlow explained how over 30 acres of his vegetables were flooded by the Connecticut River. They remained under water for several days and Paul was forced to harrow under all damaged crops.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan emphasized the special place Vermont agriculture has in the national eye:  Local food, strong markets and strong community bonds are evident and to be commended, she said. The Deputy welcomed all conversation topics from the group, offered encouragement to work through USDA paperwork and talked of the approaching Farm Bill. Our final stop of the day in Windham County was the six-generation Robb Family Farm on Ames Hill Road just west of Brattleboro.  The family welcomed the group and once again we gathered around the porch of a historic Vermont farmhouse. The Robb Family Farm has been a dairy farm and maple sugaring operation for 100 years. They now produce corn and hay for their animals on approximately 180 acres.  They recently sold the dairy cows and transitioned to beef.  They added to their 2,000 maple taps to support their successful online store and mail order business, which sells maple syrup made on the farm. Charlie Robb, Jr., who currently serves as Chair of the Windham County FSA Committee, explained how a hay field and a corn field were flooded by the Whetstone Brook from Tropical Storm Irene. This same brook also caused severe damage to Route 9, the main highway between Brattleboro and the west side of the county.  Deputy Secretary Merrigan remarked on the farmers’ resilience and disaster clean-up progress. She also noted and complimented Vermont’s agricultural leadership. Area farmers encouraged the Deputy to support a strong conservation budget, especially mentioning the impacts of invasive species in southern Vermont.  Our visit ended with many handshakes and Deputy Secretary Merrigan posing for photos with our hosts and their neighbors.  Area farmers told us how much they appreciated her concern for them and the efforts of the local USDA “boots on the ground.”  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Tags:  Farms  FSA  Hurricane Irene  Kathleen Merrigan  Vermont",What role did outpouring support from neighbors play in helping farmers like Rob Wheeler quickly clean up and bring back their large field after Tropical Storm Irene?,The outpouring of support from neighbors helped farmers like Rob Wheeler quickly clean up and bring back their large field by providing assistance to repair washed away segments.
"U.S. Forest Service Office of Communication in  Forestry  Jan 12, 2012  Mark Twery, a supervisory research forester on the Northern Research Station How does a former dancer and theater technician end up in a career in forestry? Meet Mark Twery, a supervisory research forester on the Northern Research Station in Burlington, Vt., who is not only all of the above, but loves his unique job that incorporates forestry with dance. Twery had a natural inclination toward the arts. His father was a painter while his mother continues to paint, and both of his siblings are artists in different respects. As a child, Twery toyed with the idea of becoming an artist himself. Entering college thinking he would embark in mathematics, Twery quickly realized he preferred theater arts. During his junior year, he spent a semester working at a theater in New York City. It was during a trip home to Virginia when Twery realized that he had been away from nature for too long. “I went outside and I heard a strange noise above my head,” he said. “I looked up and saw a cardinal singing. I am a birder but did not recognize that bird song. That’s when I decided that I had lived in the big city for too long.” This “wake-up call” led to Twery’s departure from theater in New York City to a brief career in woodworking in Boston. “It was good work, but I didn’t earn enough and again I began getting tired of living in a city,” he said. Twery returned to school intending to study wood technology, but instead entered the forestry master’s program at the University of Massachusetts. A Ph.D. soon followed as did a career with the Forest Service. Several years ago, Twery and his wife attended a dance performance in Burlington that weaved art and science. Fascinated by this connection, Twery, as a Forest Service liaison at the Northern Research Station, began working with the dance company to create the Moving Fields Project that incorporates dance to teach elementary school students, primarily city youth, about nature and ecology. During a typical Moving Fields Project session, Twery and dancers lead the young students to a nature area where they create movements based on what the children see or hear, such as “seeds floating off into the wind, or bark sliding off a dead tree or stepping into a pond and pulling your foot back.” Once Twery accompanied a group of inner city children from Baltimore on a Moving Fields session in a natural area, and at the end of the day, the elementary school students performed an ecological dance for their teachers and parents. Being able to combine his love for dance and forestry is one big reason Twery loves his job. “It really is true that artists and scientists follow the same steps of observation, analysis, interpretation, and communication,” he said. “It feels like I’m going full circle in my career by connecting visual and performing arts with forestry, ecology and the environment.” See what else Twery has to say in the Forest Service special feature Faces of the Forest, a bi-weekly feature of the Office of Communication to showcase the people, places and professions within the agency.

As part of this global event, every month this year USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service will profile careers of individuals who are making significant contributions to improve agricultural statistics in the United States. Growing up on a small general crop and livestock farm in central Minnesota cultivated my enthusiasm for agriculture. Even then I knew I wanted to do something related to agriculture but I also knew the value of getting a good education. I attended the University of Minnesota to earn my undergraduate degree, after which I earned a Master of Science degree at North Dakota State University. College provided me with skills in mathematics and agriculture but like most college graduates, no job. This is where the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) came into the picture. I joined the agency’s North Dakota field office as an agricultural statistician, allowing me to keep in touch with agriculture. Next I worked in the Idaho field office and then on to Washington, D.C. where I worked in both crops and livestock areas, finally settling into my current position as Chief of the Livestock Branch in 2001.

"Getting Geeky at the 3rd Annual USA Science and Engineering Festival  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. When you think of agriculture do you think of science and engineering? You should! Farmers are some of our original scientists, tinkering with plant varieties and farming techniques to find ways to reliably grow food. At USDA, we still do that kind of research in a never-ending effort to find better ways to produce food, fuel, and fiber.

"APHIS Wildlife Biologists Aid Squirrel Recovery on the Delmarva  Many claim that 2020 has been a year of chaos and calamity, but for one rare squirrel, it might be a year of hope and new beginnings. The Delmarva Fox Squirrel (DFS) is a subspecies of fox squirrel found on the eastern shore of Maryland, Southern Delaware and Virginia. This pudgy, slow squirrel with its signature size and silvery-white coat has become a conservation success story in Maryland. Habitat loss along with other additive factors landed them on the Federal endangered species list in 1967.

"A Root Beer-Based Discovery that Saved Lives  Science can do more than improve people’s lives; sometimes it can save them. Consider the contributions of the late Allene Rosalind Jeanes, an Agricultural Research Service (ARS) chemist at what is now the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Illinois. Her efforts are particularly worth celebrating this Veteran’s Day. Jeanes studied polymers (large molecules composed of many repeated subunits) found in corn, wheat and wood. She spent long hours investigating how bacteria could produce polymers in huge fermentation vats. Eventually, she found a way to mass produce dextran, a type of polymer, so that it could be used as a blood volume “expander” to sustain accident and trauma victims who have lost massive amounts of blood and need to get to a hospital for a transfusion.

"Genomics and Precision Agriculture: The Future of Farming  For nearly 400 years, Thanksgiving has been a time in North America when families come together to celebrate food and agriculture. As we reflect on yet another year, agricultural scientists at USDA continue to keep a wary eye on the future. At the end of what may be the hottest year on record, a period of drought has threatened the heart of one of the most important agricultural production zones in the United States. Water demands are increasing, and disease and pest pressures are continually evolving. This challenges our farmers’ ability to raise livestock and crops.  How are science and technology going to address the problems facing our food supply?  To find answers, agricultural scientists turn to data—big data.  Genomics, the field of science responsible for cataloging billions of DNA base pairs that encode thousands of genes in an organism, is fundamentally changing our understanding of plants and animals.  USDA has already helped to fund and collect genomes for 25 crop plant species, important livestock and fish species, and numerous bacteria, fungi, and insect species related to agricultural production. Other USDA-supported research projects expanding these efforts are currently underway, including genome sequencing of 1,000 bulls and 5,000 insect species in the i5K initiative. But classifying and understanding DNA is only part of the story.

"Participants in Open Data Roundtables Guide USDA on Ways to Provide High Quality Data to Users  “Find out who your audience and users are, then figure out the best, easiest way to provide data to them.” Last week, the Obama Administration focused on a specific climate risk – the risk to the food supply – and the ways data could be used to help increase “food resilience.” The goal is to make data, computational power, and analytic tools available to help food producers, distributors, and inspectors keep the food supply reliable and robust. As part of that effort, last Friday the GovLab and the USDA co-hosted an Open Data Roundtable on food resilience to bring together government officials, companies, and nonprofits to improve the use of data on climate and agriculture. Like the Roundtable we hosted with the White House and the Department of Commerce in June, this event was designed to promote a dialogue between government agencies that supply data and the companies and organizations that use it.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  As a major underground water source, the Ogallala Aquifer plays a key role in the economic vitality of vast stretches of the rural Midwest.  The aquifer covers around 225,000 square miles in 8 states from South Dakota to Texas, supplying 30 percent of all U.S. groundwater used for irrigation. But as with other natural resources that seem inexhaustible, the aquifer is effectively a nonrenewable resource. Demand from agricultural, municipal and industrial development on the Great Plains has meant that water is pumped out of a large portion of the aquifer much more quickly than it can ever be replenished.

"Illinois Dairy Farm's Waste Storage Gets a Makeover with USDA's Help  A dairy cow can produce up to 140 pounds of manure in a day. So for James “Jim” Johnson, who owns 150 dairy cows on his Boone County, Ill. ranch, that means 7.7 million pounds of manure per year. Where does this manure go? On many ranches, manure is stored and filtrated in a waste lagoon. But after a heavy rain in 2011 caused Johnson’s waste lagoon to overflow onto a nearby road, Johnson sought help to prevent it from happening again. In an effort to protect the quality of water and soil, he worked with the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to find a solution.

They provide wildlife habitat, store floodwaters, filter pollutants, capture carbon, and offer recreational opportunities. Since , the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has spent $20 million to establish wetland mitigation banks to help restore and protect wetland ecosystems on agricultural land. To further this effort, NRCS is partnering with Corblu Ecology Group, LLC, an environmental consulting firm in Lawrenceville, Georgia, to develop wetland mitigation banks to help producers replace the lost functions of wetlands that have been drained, dredged or filled. Since , Corblu has received $1,170,701 through NRCS’s Wetland Mitigation Banking Program (WMBP) to develop mitigation banks offering wetland credits, which can be purchased by producers in Georgia. “It’s been wonderful working with NRCS. They have been great partners in developing this project for Georgia,” said Jennifer Pahl, Corblu Director of Mitigation Markets. “NRCS is very practical in terms of their approach to wetland restoration and they are responsive, which allows us to develop mitigation projects in a timely manner to make credits available for producers who need them.” The Georgia Agricultural Wetland Bank is an umbrella bank covering the state of Georgia, under which multiple bank sites are developed to provide wetland mitigation credits. The bank currently has two approved sites generating wetland mitigation credits that are sold to producers and plans to expand to a third site in . “We’d love to implement more projects on the ground and provide credits for folks who need them,” Pahl added. “We are already planning our third site and hope to continue expanding to other areas of the state.

The multi-generational residents depend on the surrounding Chesapeake Bay for their livelihoods. For many, crabbing, oystering, and ecotourism are what puts dollars in their bank accounts, and food on their tables. In rural communities like Smith Island, located in and along the Chesapeake Bay, aging wastewater facilities are in need of upgrades. Not only can this be an expensive problem for towns with small populations, but without the critical upgrades, the threat of combined sewer overflows from more frequent weather events and climate change could contribute to pollution of the Chesapeake Bay. So, what is being done to help these rural communities protect the environment and preserve a way of life that impacts so many? USDA Rural Development and partners are answering the call by investing in state-of-the art, modern wastewater treatment facilities in communities like Smith Island and many others located throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility Smith Island’s wastewater treatment facility consisted of two pump stations, serving the three communities that make up Smith Island: Ewell, Rhodes Point, and Tylerton. After four decades and prolonged exposure to the elements, the components of the wastewater treatment facility began to corrode, break down, and fail. This left the surrounding bay and wildlife vulnerable to combined sewer overflows. Federal, state, and local agencies collaborated on a solution: a new, modern wastewater treatment facility. Through the Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant Program, USDA Rural Development provided the community with $83,000 in loan, and $5,000,000 in grant funds, with other partners providing the balance, to help the community afford the $22.3 million Smith Island Wastewater Treatment Facility. Peter Bozick, Executive Vice President of George, Miles & Buhr, LLC, the engineer and architecture firm that designed the new facility said, “The island is sinking slowly due to climate change and rising sea levels, and the former infrastructure was susceptible to flooding. In addition to replacing the treatment facility with new materials that can resist corrosion, we raised the pumping stations about five feet higher in order to be above the 100-year flood zone.” Read more about how this significant investment in improving infrastructure on Smith Island is contributing to a positive outlook for the future of Smith Island.

"Mountain Plains Regional Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Equity  Nutrition Security  Nov 08,  It was a sunny fall day in mid-October when I had the honor of visiting the Omaha Nation WIC program. Upon meeting WIC Director Jessika Free-Bass, I visited the Tribe's WIC garden, which they use to grow produce for client nutrition education. For the Omaha Tribe, nutrition education is a community effort. Free-Bass says that the Omaha Nation WIC program recognizes the importance of incorporating Indigenous foods and traditional cooking practices into the WIC experience to form a holistic approach to nutrition education. Recently, they have taken extra steps to spotlight foods indigenous to their community, as well as dishes and cooking methods traditionally used by the Umóⁿhoⁿ people. This year, the WIC garden grew tomatoes and WIC clients prepared tomato sauce. The garden also produced carrots, which the program used to teach ways to prepare baby food. The WIC garden is small, so the program partners closely with several community organizations to further its nutrition education efforts. For example, the nearby Umóⁿhoⁿ school garden donates squash and indigenous corn to the program for lessons. Omaha WIC also partners with the Nebraska Indian Community College, using their kitchen facilities to provide nutrition education sessions and cooking demonstrations. The WIC program aims to safeguard the health of income eligible women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutrition risk by providing nutritious foods and information on healthy eating. As we celebrate Native American Heritage Month, I applaud the Omaha Nation for connecting mothers, young children, and the community in celebrating healthy, traditional food.

Team Nutrition will soon release an updated whole grains resource for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.  Through the Team Nutrition Training Grant Program, FNS works with State agencies to implement training programs that improve the quality and variety of school meals. Several grant cohorts are working on expanding and evaluating interventions to improve the quality of school meals , develop school meal recipes that use local agricultural products , and training school nutrition professionals to implement new meal pattern standards . In , Team Nutrition awarded $5.ates increase local foods in school meals. FNS awarded over $7 million for the grants.  The Child Nutrition Recipe Box provides program operators with recipes to prepare healthy and delicious meals that meet school nutrition requirements.  Team Nutrition’s Food Buying Guide for child nutrition programs, also known as the FBG, has been around for about 70 years and continues to be one of Team Nutrition’s most popular resources. The FBG aims to assist child nutrition program operators in two major ways: helps operators determine how much food to purchase for meals and snacks; and helps operators determine how each food counts toward meal pattern requirements. The FBG provides yield for more than 2,100 foods and has been transformed from a printed publication to an interactive web-based tool and mobile application for smartphones and tablets. The FBG mobile app was the agency’s first public-facing mobile application. and has amassed more than 37,500 downloads and visitors from more than 73 countries since it launched in .

Team Nutrition and ICN  Team Nutrition and the Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN) provide webinars, virtual instructor-led trainings, and in-person trainings to support child nutrition program operators with meal planning and nutrition standards. In , Team Nutrition and ICN provided trainings to more than 49,600 child nutrition program operators and administrators through 356 training opportunities.  USDA FNS worked cooperatively with ICN to create the Culinary Institute of Child Nutrition (CICN). The goal of CICN is to increase culinary skills of school nutrition professionals through culinary trainings and resources that help them prepare and serve healthy, culinary-inspired school meals from scratch, elevating the cafeteria atmosphere. The CICN currently offers monthly culinary webinars, culinary how-to videos, podcasts, and more. Additional culinary resources and trainings are being developed.  To help schools meet the updated school meal nutrition standards, Team Nutrition and ICN released a collection of sodium reduction training materials on the Shaking It Up! website, including training worksheets, videos, and posters. Online learning courses to support sodium reduction are also being developed. Working with industry to help tailor products to our programs  School-Age Children  The food industry plays a critical role in strengthening access to nutritious foods for school meals. To help facilitate updates to the school meal standards, FNS engages with industry to support the production of nutritious foods for the K–12 market, including, for example, products meeting the updated targets for sodium and whole grains.  USDA purchased about 1.5 billion pounds of USDA Foods for schools in FY21. USDA Foods are high quality, nutritious, and 100% American grown, processed, and packed. USDA works collaboratively with industry to develop specifications for foods that support USDA nutrition standards. These foods provide versatile, budget-friendly options for schools to incorporate into appealing, healthy meals. Options include a wide variety of fresh, frozen, canned, and dried fruits and vegetables; a variety of nutrient-dense protein options such as lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, cheese, nuts, and eggs; and a variety of whole grain options including cereals, flour, pasta, rice, and tortillas.  Through McGovern-Dole, USDA administered the Micronutrient Fortified Food Aid Pilot Project from to to develop specialized nutritious products for school meals and snacks in low and lower-middle income countries. New products developed included a fortified poultry spread, a dairy paste, a lipid-based nutrient supplement, fortified rice, and new fortified, blended foods. Currently, in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), USDA is supporting a shelf-life study of fortified rice in harsh field conditions. USDA manages the U.S. Government’s food aid commodities list, and USDA and USAID collaborate on joint food aid product issues, including product development, food safety, and specification updates.  In October , USDA hosted the National Nutrition Security and Healthcare Summit with the goals of: 1) celebrating and showcasing what the healthcare sector is already doing to help advance nutrition security; identifying existing and potentially stronger intersections with USDA’s equities; and raising awareness about opportunities to help USDA advance nutrition security. It featured remarks from USDA Secretary Vilsack, HHS Secretary Becerra, Chairman McGovern, former Representative Herrera Beutler, and healthcare sector leaders leaning into nutrition security. Guests included more than 200 representatives from across the healthcare sector, among other key communities including Congressional staff and the media.

"Communications Director, Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Nov 30,  Since , FEED 7 Generations has worked to improve the health and wellness of Native people in the Pacific Northwest. Based in King County, Washington, FEED 7 Generations creates environmental health through land management strategies, community health projects, and direct food access projects. “We are a tribal-led food sovereignty organization,” said Executive Director Romajean Thomas. “We want to help Native people in our area be as healthy as possible while ensuring that our dollars stay within the local food system and within Native communities.” To further these efforts, the organization was able to secure a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant, designed to help underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. The organization is using this grant to strengthen local businesses and enhance food security and community connections. They began by conducting a needs analysis. “We’ve been out traveling to these farms, some of them really far out there, to meet with producers and understand their needs.” said Thomas. “We’ve had great success in building relationships.” Using the collected, the organization created a Native Grown and Gathered resource directory featuring Native farms and food producers in Washington, Oregon and Idaho. “We want to make it easy for Native people to eat food grown, harvested, made and produced by other Native people,” said Thomas. “This will help catalyze food sovereignty efforts and strengthen Native food systems nationwide.” The needs analysis also revealed that Native producers would benefit from additional training opportunities. With that, the organization hosted an annual food sovereignty symposium to showcase regional Native agricultural production and producers. Attendees could also learn how to start a food business, bring cultural traditions into the marketplace, and develop strong connections within Indian Country’s food system. Thomas and her team plan to coordinate additional trainings to connect food producers with the programs and grants offered by USDA. “We are able to identify tribal producers within our communities and ask them what they need, then connect them to appropriate USDA products that help them,” she said. “The grant has helped us to bring native food to Native people while enhancing the local food economy. We see this as a platform for our food sovereignty efforts for this region and hopefully nationally.”  Category/Topic:  Equity  Initiatives  Tags:  Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement  OPPE  grant  Tribal  You May Also Like  National Scholar’s Roots Run Deep in Agriculture  CAPAL Intern Driven to Change Food Insecurity  HEP/CAMP Intern Draws Inspiration from USDA","What specific initiative is FEED 7 Generations taking to connect underserved Native food producers with training opportunities and USDA grants, in order to promote food sovereignty and strengthen local food systems?","FEED 7 Generations is hosting an annual food sovereignty symposium to provide training opportunities for Native producers on topics such as starting a food business, bringing cultural traditions into the marketplace, and connecting with Indian Country's food system.

"The Program The Farm Bill created the Program to help underserved farmers, ranchers and foresters who have historically experienced limited access to USDA programs and services. The Farm Bill expanded the Program to include veterans. The objective of the Program is to show USDA’s commitment to ensuring that underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters can equitably participate in USDA programs. Grants are awarded to community-based and non-profit organizations, higher education institutions and eligible tribal entities with at least 3 years of experience in working with socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers or veteran farmers and ranchers. Individual farmers and ranchers are not eligible to apply for Program grants. Because of differences in demographics, culture, economics, language and other factors, there is no one single approach to identifying solutions that can benefit underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. Program partners are based in local communities and rural areas where they serve a critical role in maximizing USDA’s outreach efforts by identifying systemic barriers that need to be removed and working to increase equitable participation in USDA’s programs and services. Projects funded under the Program include, but are not limited to, conferences, workshops and demonstrations on various farming techniques and other efforts to connect underserved farmers and ranchers to USDA local officials to help communities increase their awareness of USDA’s programs and services.

"Minnesota USDA Public Information Officer in  USDA Results  Rural  May 23,   Walking through AGCO’s campus in Jackson, Minn., almost feels like walking through a small city. There are large buildings, busy people heading in different directions, vehicles humming up and down roads and the constant buzz of activity and production. If AGCO was its own city, it’d be growing. Officials from USDA Rural Development and Federated Rural Electric Cooperative recently visited AGCO to highlight how a Rural Economic Development Loan is partially financing an expansion project that will increase production and create about 200 jobs. The no-interest, 10-year loan is going toward a new 75,000 square-foot addition that will add a state-of-the-art visitor’s center and additional production space. The expansion is helping AGCO roll out production of the Massey Ferguson series and the Challenger MT600 series of high horsepower wheeled tractors. “We’re a part of the community here in Jackson and we’re proud to be expanding and adding more jobs in the region,” said Eric Fisher, AGCO’s Director of Operations. AGCO’s workforce is expected to grow from 850 to almost 1,100. The company is currently producing about 50 tractors per month of the new series.  Combined with current tractor production volumes the company will product over 2,500 tractors in Jackson this year. USDA Rural Development makes loans to local utility cooperatives which are passed through and re-loaned to area businesses for expansion and job creation projects. Federated Rural Electric and Rural Development have a strong partnership and have teamed to assist several local businesses in the region.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  USDA Results  Research and Science  Jun 24,   June through September is wildfire season in the United States and on June 18 there were already 16 active major fires consuming more than 102,000 acres.  As much damage and destruction these fires cause, even more may be on the way when future rains cause mudslides from soil erosion on barren hills.  That’s where “Woodstraw” comes in. WoodStraw® is a wood-based erosion control product that was developed by Forest Concepts, in Auburn, WA, using a Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) grant administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  This material is made from low-grade waste wood veneer and resembles oversized pick-up sticks.  Wood-based erosion control products have many advantages over traditional grass straw as an erosion-control material because it is heaver and will not blow away, is 100 percent seed and weed-free, and is effective on slopes of up to 70 percent grade. SBIR grants come in two forms: Phase I and Phase II.  A 6-month Phase 1 grant allows grantees to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed projects – and gives the government a chance to determine the quality of the grantee’s performance before awarding Phase II funding.  Phase II provide funding to awardees to continue their research and development efforts for up to 2 years. Forest Concepts proved its wood-based erosion control theory in initial field trials, where the product reduced erosion by more than 98 percent; it proved to be especially effective in reducing erosion in areas that have been impacted by forest fires.  Since , the company has produced more than 14,000 tons of material for projects managed by the U.S. Forest Service; the Bureau of Land Management; national parks; and state, county, and city departments of transportation and parks.  It has been used in more than 30 post-wildfire erosion control projects. In , Forest Concepts sold a license to Mountain Pine Manufacturing, Inc., to produce wood-based erosion control materials in Steamboat Springs, CO.  Mountain Pine uses dead, beetle-kill trees to produce material.  This process helps answer the region’s beetle-kill problem and provides engineered mulch that promotes regeneration of new live trees.  Production at both facilities creates sustainable jobs in the erosion control and biomass production and supply industries. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Food Economics Division, Economic Research Service (ERS) in  Research and Science  May 14,  The Food Dollar Series includes the industry group value-added series, which divides the food dollar into total value added (cost share) for 12 industry groups: agribusiness; farm production; food processing; packaging; transportation services; energy; wholesale trade; retail trade; foodservices; finance and insurance; advertising; and legal and accounting services. In , consumers in the United States spent $1.2 trillion on U.S.-produced food. Nearly all food starts out on a farm, but did you ever wonder how the value added from processing, packaging, transporting, and marketing agricultural food products factors into the costs? USDA’s Economic Research Service has a tool that can show you this breakdown. ERS recently updated its Food Dollar Series product. This most recent annual update added to the historical going back to . Aside from detailing what U.S. total food spending pays for, the Food Dollar Series tells us what consumers pay for at grocery stores (food-at-home dollars) and restaurants (food-away-from-home dollars). Of the $1.2 trillion in food spending, the largest cost share of the food dollar went to foodservices (restaurants) at 36.7 percent – this pays for others to host, prepare, and serve our meals, then clean-up afterwards. The next largest share, at 15 percent, went to food processors, such as bakeries, meat and dairy processors, and frozen food manufacturers. Rounding out the top five industry groups are food retailers, like grocery store chains and independent grocers , wholesalers of both food products and production inputs , and farm producers . The farm producer’s share is what they receive after they pay for production inputs like seed, fertilizer, and electricity. The value of farm commodities sold to fulfill food purchases represented 14.6 percent of the food’s purchase price, down from 14.8 cents in . Although was the lowest level since the beginning of this series in and the 6th consecutive year the farm share dropped, the decline in was smaller than in and . For the fourth year in a row, saw no increase in the farm production cost share of the food dollar. But unlike in -16 when the cost of farm production in the food dollar dropped sharply, average prices received by U.S. farmers actually went up in . This period also coincided with six consecutive years of increases in the foodservice industry share of the food dollar, driven by a continuing trend of consumers spending more of their food dollars eating out. So, increases in eating-out spending by consumers actually offset the likely increase in the farm production cost share, as more money went to food services.

"Chief Mathematical Statistician and Research and Development Division Director, National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Research and Science  Jan 19,  The Census of Agriculture found that 14 percent of the nation’s farms are run by a woman. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio.  The Census of Agriculture is still two years away but, at the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), we work hard to continually improve the we collect. The agriculture census conducted every five years is the one time we collect demographic information on today’s farmers and ranchers. The Census found that 14 percent of the nation’s 2.1 million farms are run by a woman, and women make up 30 percent of all farmers when up to three operators per farm are included. Similarly, 25 percent of farmers were beginning farmers (ten years or less on their current farm) in . But, as we get ready for the next census, we want to make sure that our fully capture the role of women farmers and beginning farmers in agriculture today. After releasing the Census results and based on feedback from stakeholders, we began to explore better ways to quantify the participation of women and beginning farmers in the operation of U.S. farms, given the limited space available on the questionnaire. NASS has asked farmers to identify the principal operators and other operators on the farm. Often the senior male family member is listed as the principal operator, even if he is no longer working. If a husband and a wife are partners on the farm and share equally in the operations, the husband is generally listed as the principal operator. How should the questions be asked so that the participation of beginning farmers and women are more fully identified? Last spring, USDA Deputy Secretary Krysta Harden and I hosted the first ever USDA Google+ Hangout to examine in images and stories the experiences of today’s women farmers. It was an inspiring exchange that underscored how important it is for agriculture statistics to reflect women farmers’ roles as well. To address the challenges in collecting additional and to make sure we are asking the best questions, we commissioned the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS) to convene an independent panel of experts. The panel reviewed the demographic questions on the Census of Agriculture as well as numerous other surveys. Input from stakeholders and the general public was solicited. The panel made recommendations on how NASS can best capture the changing face of U.S. agriculture in the next census. One of the panel’s recommendations was to ask about the characteristics of up to four decision makers (not operators) per farm and the specific decisions they make for the operation. We are currently testing this proposed change, along with others. We mailed a draft census questionnaire to 30,000 farmers and ranchers around the country, asking them to help. By completing the form, they will help us determine whether the content, wording, and design enable respondents to provide the information that policymakers, businesses, farmers, and other stakeholders need. Further revisions to the questionnaire will be made based on these results. By participating in the test, farmers and ranchers help improve the Census of Agriculture questionnaire and help us provide a more precise count of America’s farmers and their contributions.

"Lessons from the Field: A New Series for Food Hub Development  Since , USDA has invested in 29,100 local food opportunities, including food hubs, small scale processing and farmers markets across all 50 states and the US territories. These investments include over 12,000 loans and micro-loans to small-scale producers who often sell products locally and over 13,000 high tunnels (low-cost covered structures that extend the growing season and make locally-grown products available later in the year). However, as with any investment, the success of a business depends not just on an infusion of capital, but also on good planning.

"Delivering Along the Food Value Chain  A recent trip back home to Louisiana sparked memories of a simpler time when old trucks full of fresh produce rumbled down dusty roads to deliver goods to the local market. The Census of Agriculture tells us that 50,000 farmers and ranchers nationwide are now selling to local retailers and that 150,000 of them are selling their products directly to consumers. Although these farmers and ranchers are still using this direct approach, the agricultural industry is certainly more dynamic today.  This means that producers need to follow a strategic business model. The reality is that food can go through a lot of steps to reach the consumer. Before it is served on the table, food travels from the field to the truck to the packing house to the store.

All of the city’s fire equipment will soon be under one roof, which will help improve the fire station’s efficiencies when crews respond to emergencies in its 400 square mile service area.  The new station is being built with funding support from USDA and a local electric cooperative. According to City of Quinter Administrator, Ericka Gillespie, the city of less than 1,000 needed a new fire station because the old facility was not meeting the needs of the community.

"USDA Rural Development Idaho Public Information Officer in  Initiatives  Rural  Jan 05,   Wow, the first emergency call out of the new fire station.  As I pulled into the driveway of the new Heyburn, Idaho, Fire Station for the ribbon cutting, I was greeted with the red lights flashing on the fire truck as the fire crew rushed to their call.

But then my thoughts turned back to the two days prior, when the volunteers gathered at the new station for an additional training session.   Some of the volunteers on that truck were the same volunteers at the training, who were once again taking time away from their paid jobs, to ensure their neighbors and employers have access to the same emergency services that I take for granted living in the Boise metropolitan area. Volunteer Fire fighters are known for providing emergency services, but now I began to see how they also contribute to the economic opportunity of this rural community.  Their commitment not only saves local tax dollars, but also helps build a solid economic foundation.  We know that construction related jobs were saved during the construction of the new station, but how many jobs will be created or saved as a result of the emergency services provided through the fire fighters service? During the grand opening, it felt as if the entire community turned out for the ribbon cutting.  Most of the organizations involved in the planning, funding, and construction were present as well.   Afterward, I was told how the voters in the Minidoka County Fire Protection District overwhelming supported the bond for the new station.

"Caribbean Hub Director in  Mar 17,  Dr. Guillermo Ortiz of the University of Puerto Rico and rancher Neftali Lluch of the Lajas Valley in Puerto Rico discuss various practical steps to combat rising temperatures and prolonged drought. Photo credit: University of Puerto Rico We are living in historic moments in the world’s response to climate change. Last December in Paris, delegates from 196 countries signed an agreement to work towards curtailing greenhouse gas emissions and to keep global warming to “well below” 2 °C degrees. This is a big step, but there is still much work to be done and the agricultural sector has an important role to play. Agriculture, forestry, and land degradation contribute just under a quarter of anthropogenic GHG emissions, mainly from deforestation and agricultural emissions from livestock, soil and nutrient management.  Climate change also poses a great challenge for food security and nutrition. It can reduce yields and affect where and how food is produced. As the risks of natural disasters increase, farmers need to modify how they produce food in order to become more resilient to prolonged droughts, excessive rains, floods, and more intense storms. Farmers in the Caribbean are among the most strongly affected by climate change, as Caribbean countries are in general highly vulnerable to climate change due to their geography and socioeconomic status. So what farming practices can tropical producers use to adapt and minimize the impacts of climate change? The USDA Caribbean Climate Hub, located at the US Forest Service International Institute of Tropical Forestry in Puerto Rico, is partnering with Universities and farmers in the U.S. Caribbean to release ADAPTA, a series of demonstration projects that communicate the best adaptive practices available to tropical producers. ADAPTA logo As part of the series, we are developing videos and factsheets that highlight adaptation practices in dairy, plantain, fruit and vegetable, and forest production. ADAPTA is part of an integrated communications plan to deliver climate adaptation practices to a diverse set of producers that builds on the assessment of risk and vulnerabilities that we completed last year to better understand the potential effect of climate change on agriculture and forestry in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. “Cattle & Dairy Farming in the Tropics” is the first video released and highlights adaptation practices for tropical dairy producers. Dairy is an important farming practice in Puerto Rico and St. Croix, involving more than 50,000 acres and generating over 25,000 jobs. Drought and heat have been hitting producers hard and have had detrimental effects on the livestock and dairy industries by making cattle more susceptible to worms, ticks, and dairy cattle becomes stressed and produce less milk. As grasses died due to lack of rain, producers in the U.S. Virgin Islands were forced to take measures ranging from collecting tree limbs and branches for fodder, to relying on imported feed and even culling herds. Pastures were so over taxed, that many will have to be re-sown completely at great cost to farmers. In Puerto Rico, producers saw their costs rise as they relied ever more heavily on imported feed. Many also saw their production go down as heat stress and lack of nutrients took their tolls on local herds. Unfortunately, climate models in the region are predicting dramatic changes in rainfall cycles, in which prolonged periods of drought are interrupted by intense rainfall events. However, there are measures that farmers can take to reduce the impacts of drought and increased temperatures, as showcased in the first video of the ADAPTA series. We believe Caribbean producers are some of the most innovative in the world. Through this project we hope to highlight and share how local farmers are adapting to remain successful in the face of climate change and other challenges. The Caribbean Hub is promoting cooperation by providing open venues and forums to address climate vulnerability as part of the USDA Regional Climate Hub comprehensive strategy to help farmers mitigate and adapt to climate change. The Climate Hubs are integrating efforts of the USDA Agricultural Research Service, National Resource Conservation Service, the US Forest Service, and other USDA agencies with state governments, local universities, and non-profits to help coordinate and streamline efforts to ensure the vitality of US working lands in the face of climate change.

"Agricultural Marketing Service Deputy Associate Administrator in  Research and Science  Feb 12,  Currently a proposal for an Organic R&P is getting closer to Step 1 in the creation process. While a proposal has not been formally submitted to USDA, a proponent group is working with stakeholders to develop a draft. USDA photo courtesy of Sam Jones-Ellard. We often talk about the many ways research and promotion (R&P) programs benefit both ag industries and the consumer. Our nation’s farmers and ranchers leverage these programs and the pooled resources they collect to help overcome marketing barriers and connect with consumers. R&P programs are self-help initiatives that are national in scope and funded by the industry to help these businesses continue to strengthen their rural economies and the communities they support. To form a new R&P, there are specific steps that the industry and USDA follow:  STEP 1: A proponent submits a proposal to USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which oversees all national R&P programs. The proposal typically includes an analysis of the industry, the program’s objective, and its potential impact on small businesses. While there are specific requirements needed for a proposal, the proponent can tailor the proposed program to best meet a specific industry’s needs. For example, some proposals include different eligibility requirements to vote in their referendums or an exemption for small producers, handlers and importers. STEP 2: USDA publishes the proposal in the Federal Register, soliciting public comments so that prevailing industry thoughts are incorporated into the final program. This is important because these programs will use pooled resources from across the industry to invest in creative marketing campaigns and innovative research projects that will support all of the industry’s growers, handlers, processors, manufacturers and importers. STEP 3: After the comment period ends, USDA reviews and analyzes the comments to determine whether the program has merit to move forward. STEP 3a: If a review of comments shows general consensus or agreement among the industry stakeholders, USDA moves forward with the proposal and a second proposed rule is published in the Federal Register to announce a referendum so the industry can vote on the rule. STEP 3b: If a review of the public comments suggests that a proposal needs to be re-evaluated, there are two options:  1) if the comments suggest a need to adjust parts of the proposal, a supplemental proposed rule can be published to modify parts of the proposal and request that the industry provides further comments; 2) the proposal is terminated. STEP 4: USDA conducts a referendum, allowing eligible parties to vote on whether or not the measure is approved. STEP 5: If the referendum is approved by the eligible voters within the industry, USDA issues a final rule implementing the program. For proposals that request a delayed referendum, the program will be announced as a final rule with a referendum to be held at a later date. STEP 6: Nominations from the industry are collected and a board is appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to represent the interests of the entire industry. USDA seeks nominations from the industry for board members and alternates. These steps are intended to help the farmers and businesses establish a framework that will work across an entire industry and make the broadest positive impact for everyone involved.  Industry research and promotion programs have played an important role in shaping the agricultural landscape and yielding positive results for farmers and businesses throughout the country. For example, when research supports adding lean pork to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension – or DASH – eating plan, it helps consumers create healthy menus to meet their nutritional needs and it helps pork producers connect with a larger consumer base. And an August economic analysis found a return on investment (ROI) of $8.87 for every dollar the peanut industry invested into the National Peanut Board activities over the last 5 years. These are just a couple of ways that research and promotion programs are making a positive contribution for our nation’s agricultural businesses. USDA is committed to supporting these industry-driven programs, and ensuring that they address the needs and help meet the challenges faced by today’s farmers and agricultural businesses. Currently a proposal for a Hardwood Lumber R&P has reached Step 3 in the process. Public and industry comments are being evaluated by USDA. Photo courtesy of IndoGemstone.

"Secretary Perdue Proclaims April as ‘Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month’  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .19  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@oc.usda.gov  (Washington, D.C., April 1, ) – Spring is a popular time to move, but unfortunately, people aren’t the only ones on the move. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today signed a national proclamation (, 579 ) to declare April “Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month,” during a critical time when damaging invasive species known as Hungry Pests emerge and can be easily spread in the things people pack and move, such as outdoor items like grills, gardening equipment, wading pools and bicycles or patio furniture. Hungry Pests are a real problem. They attack trees, plants and agriculture, costing the United States about $40 billion each year in damages and expensive eradication and control efforts. Household moves increase the risk for the spread of these invasive species, since people can potentially transport them to new areas. About 35 million Americans move every year, making the possibility of transporting invasive pests high. For instance, federal and state inspectors often find gypsy moth egg masses on outdoor household items and recreational vehicles in non-infested areas. The United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) is offering a free checklist for household moves that includes suggestions and tips for reducing this risk. The agency is also working with the United States Postal Service’s My Move program to help educate the moving public about the things they can do to help prevent the spread of Hungry Pests. “Hungry Pests can hide inside plants, fruits, vegetables and firewood, and spread in a number of ways, like on outdoor items you move to a new home or on an RV that has been parked outside and driven cross-country,” said Kevin Shea, APHIS Administrator. “It only takes one person to start a new infestation, which is why we all need to be careful and understand how to stop invasive pests.” Here are key ways the public can help:  Moving to a new home. Help protect your new city and neighborhood from invasive pests by removing eggs masses and insects from your patio furniture, grills, bikes and other outdoor items – before they are loaded onto the moving van or storage pod.  Traveling within the United States. Before doing an out-of-state trip, make sure your car, RV or other outdoor vehicle is cleaned first. Check the wheel wells, bumpers and other hard-to-see areas to make sure they are free of soil, egg masses, and insects. In addition to moves, pests can also be spread by:  Mailing homegrown plants, fruits and vegetables. Commercially bought goods are regulated to meet government standards, including those for invasive pests, but items grown in a home garden are not. If you live in an area quarantined for a specific pest, don’t mail produce or plants from your garden to others. Contact your local APHIS office for more information.  Moving untreated firewood. Invasive pests like the emerald ash borer and Asian longhorned beetle burrow inside wood to lay their eggs. Don’t take untreated firewood with you, for example, on camping trips. Instead, buy certified, heat-treated firewood or responsibly gather wood at your destination.  Traveling internationally. It’s tempting to want to return with an unusual plant, a souvenir made from plants or wood, or even a piece of fruit as a snack for the plane trip home. However, U.S. laws prohibit many of these items from entering the country because they could harbor an invasive pest. Contact your local APHIS office to find out what’s allowed. And always declare these items to U.S. Customs and Border officials when you land. Failure to do so could result in unexpected delays and fines.  Buying plants for your garden. When buying garden items in person, be sure to ask the retailer if they comply with federal and state quarantine restrictions to ensure their plants are free of invasive pests. Before you buy plants online, check if the seller is in the United States. If they are in another country, you might need an import permit or other documents to legally bring the items into the United States. Contact your local APHIS office for more information. Finally, learn more by going to www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests or join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter. The website includes photos and descriptions of each Hungry Pest, and a Pest Tracker to find those in your state. To report a pest or contact your local APHIS office, visit www.aphis.usda.gov/planthealth/sphd or call USDA Customer Service toll free at 1-844-820- (Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern). # USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer and lender.","What should you not do when mailing homegrown plants or produce to others, according to USDA guidelines?","You should not mail homegrown plants or produce from areas quarantined for a specific pest to others, as this can spread invasive pests.

"International Affairs Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Feb 26,  Targeting over 80 crops, the Fall Armyworm poses a significant threat to global food security. USDA researchers tackle tough problems critical to American agriculture. Addressing how to nurture heathy soils, improve crop yields, or prevent livestock diseases, they carefully plan experiments and analyze that can lead to better on-farm decisions and more productive practices. But even scientists can’t always predict how far their work will eventually go. Recently, USDA researchers in Florida have seen their work take on unexpected relevance in Africa with the outbreak of an invasive crop pest. Fall Armyworm (FAW, Spdoptera frugiperda) is a destructive pest that can feed on 80 different crop species, including corn. Native to the Americas, USDA has studied FAW since the s. U.S. farmers currently manage it through integrated pest management approaches, combining the use of pesticides, genetically engineered crops, and other technologies and techniques. FAW was first reported in Africa in , and has now been documented in more than 30 African countries. Although we have decades of experience managing FAW in the United States, it is relatively new to African farmers, where corn is a staple crop for more than 300 million subsistence farmers and small-scale producers. The international community has mobilized to address this growing crisis, with U.S. Government agencies contributing their own expertise. USDA’s significant experience with the pest in the U.S. has positioned it as a trusted source of technical information on FAW biology and control measures. Studies by USDA scientists Robert Meagher and Rodney Nagoshi (Insect Behavior and Biocontrol Research, Gainesville, FL) provided valuable technical insights in the recently released Fall Armyworm in Africa: A Guide for Integrated Pest Management. With tips on pest identification, available technologies, and best practices for managing FAW, this guide was jointly produced under the U.S. Government’s Feed the Future initiative by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the CGIAR Research Program on Maize (CRP MAIZE). Research that started out with the objective of helping U.S. corn farmers increase their yields is serving double duty now, playing a role in African food security. Although you can’t predict what agricultural issues the future may hold, you can count on USDA research having a global impact. USDA scientists provided expertise and training for the new guidebook countering the Fall Armyworm’s destruction of African crops. Recently, USDA shared FAW information in the Feed the Future information booth at the recent USDA Agricultural Outlook Forum.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Apr 09,  Spotted lanternfly. (USDA photo by Lance Cheung) (Editor’s note: Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue on April 1 proclaimed “Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month.” The following illustrates some of the research that USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture supports to control invasive pests in agriculture.) Good things come in small packages, right? Not always. Oftentimes, what may appear to be a vibrant field of pastoral charm or gently blowing golden waves of grain are actually battlefields where small invading armies threaten the nation’s economic, social, and environmental well-being. “Nearly every terrestrial, wetland, and aquatic ecosystem in the United States has been invaded by non-native species, with economic losses estimated at $137 billion per year,” said Robert Nowierski, national program leader for biobased pest management at USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NIFA is in the vanguard of the fight to control, mitigate, and eradicate invasive pests, through funding and national program leadership. NIFA’s invasive pest portfolio includes sponsorship of four Regional Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Centers; establishment of the National Plant and Animal Diagnostic Laboratory Networks; and funding State Agricultural Experiment Station projects, the regional research and extension efforts of multi-state committees, and plant production and protection research conducted through the Small Business Innovation Research program. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques, such as biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, and minimizing the use of pesticides. Benefits of IPM include greater survival of a pest’s natural enemies, slower development of pesticide resistance, less pest resurgence, fewer outbreaks of secondary pests, less negative impact on the environment, and greater worker safety. In addition, many farmers report greater profits because they’ve reduced their expenses on pesticide. NIFA’s programs support projects from research discovery, through research and development, to extension education and implementation of plans. Some of the higher profile invasive pest projects include the brown marmorated stink bug, spotted wing drosophila, West Nile virus, and the spotted lanternfly. According to Nowierski, the spotted lanternfly is probably the showiest of the invasive species pests. “I was on an invasive species field tour last year and visited a farmer’s grape vineyard severely impacted by the spotted lanternfly. He lost half-a-million dollars from spotted lanternfly damage to his 40-acre vineyard in !” NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"International Programs and Ellita Willis, Office of Communication in  Conservation  Apr 12,   Migratory species play unique ecological roles because of their intrinsic beauty and significance in culture and identity.  Despite this, bats, birds, butterflies and dragonflies face a multitude of threats both in the US and in Latin America and the Caribbean where they migrate during the winter. If these habitats are not protected, the tremendous US domestic investment in conserving these species is wasted. Receiving the award for “Communities in Conservation” are Luisa Lopez, Counselor at El Valor and Vincent Jordan, participant in El Valor's Adults with Different Abilities Program. They are holding one of the products of this program—a monarch butterfly made for Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead. An award ceremony for conservation of birds, bats and butterflies was recently held in Atlanta.  The Wings Across the Americas event paid special tribute to partnerships that contribute to conservation efforts. Successful conservation work typically happens through partnerships—recent award-winning projects were no exception.  All of the Forest Service employees receiving awards shared the stage with partners from a myriad of organizations.

USDA photo. As part of Bird Health Awareness Week, USDA recently hosted a webinar on “Growing Chicks into Healthy Chickens.”  Dr. Martin Smeltzer, Andy Schneider (aka the “Chicken Whisperer”) and Dr. Claudia Dunkley spent an hour helping backyard bird owners learn more about keeping their flocks healthy.  Around 300 people participated in the webinar, most of who are just getting started with backyard birds. The goal of Bird Health Awareness Week is to help protect backyard birds from disease. The webinar focused on the cute little baby birds known as chicks. Now, I am not a poultry person, but I love eggs, so I thought this would be something interesting to learn.  I found out that raising backyard poultry is a growing trend.  People like to raise chicks into adults for their eggs, and for the entertainment value of having birds in their backyard. I didn’t know there were so many rules when it comes to starting a flock. You need to think about why you want to raise backyard birds and what you intend to do with them.  You also need to find out if it is legal where you live - check city and local ordinances and find out if you need a permit.  If you have one, you should also check with your Homeowners Association.   Look to see if inspections or other steps are to start a flock, and be sure to buy chicks from a National Poultry Improvement Plan- approved source to ensure they start out healthy. I was surprised to find out that young chicks must be separated from older birds, for them to be secure and safe from disease.  Let chicks grow into birds in a separate, clean environment before introducing them into your flock that contains older birds. There are two major diseases that can threaten backyard birds - Avian Influenza and Exotic Newcastle Disease. The webinar discussed six simple steps to help protect your birds from disease.  We also learned what potential signs of illness might include and what to do if you think your birds might be sick. Are you considering raising birds or want some tips for adding to your current flock?  The full webinar is available online, including nutrition tips and other information to help you grow a healthy and happy flock in your own backyard!

Photo courtesy of Ray Hammerschmidt With support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), the National Plant Diagnostic Network has grown into an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories dedicated to enhancing agricultural security by protecting health and productivity of plants in agricultural and natural ecosystems.  Dr. Ray Hammerschmidt, President of the National Plant Diagnostic Network, discusses this partnership and the benefits all Americans receive in the following guest post: Superheroes really do work among us. But, instead of capes and cowls and ice palaces and caves, they are often found in a lab at a public university or state agriculture department, wearing lab coats and working over a microscope. These men and women work daily to protect our communities and crops from dangerous pests and pathogens.  They are plant pathologists, entomologists, nematologists, weed scientists, and other plant scientists who work diligently to mitigate the impact of endemic, emerging, and exotic pathogens and pests that attack agricultural, forest, and landscape plants in the United States. We live in a global society where people, food, and materials travel in and out of our country 24 hours a day.  In addition to natural introduction of pathogens and pests – such as the hurricane that brought soybean rust to the United States – our ports, highways, and airports are also entryways for new insects and diseases that hop a ride on cargo containers, suitcases, and even travelers’ clothing. Whether it is citrus greening disease (which is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid and threatens citrus production), emerald ash borer (an exotic beetle that has killed millions of ash trees in North America), or purple loosestrife (which invades our wetlands and displaces native vegetation), plants, pests, and pathogens threaten our food and water supply and, potentially, our economic security. The scientists, engaged with the National Plant Diagnostic Network (NPDN), are on the front lines and protect us from these threats by providing timely and accurate diagnostics. Established in , NPDN represents individuals from land-grant universities, federal agencies, state departments of agriculture, and other stakeholders and is an internationally respected consortium of plant diagnostic laboratories. NPDN provides a cohesive, distributed system to quickly detect and identify pests and pathogens of concern. NPDN laboratories immediately report their findings to appropriate responders and decision makers. To accomplish its mission, NPDN has invested in diagnostic laboratory infrastructure and training, developed an extensive network of first detectors through education and outreach, and created an enhanced communication network among public agencies and stakeholders responsible for responding to and mitigating new outbreaks. Their work is supported in part by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NPDN labs routinely support national, state, and local response to disease and pest outbreaks. They have trained and registered 11,480 first detectors nationwide. In addition, NPDN labs have been involved in more than 1 million diagnoses, and this number climbs daily. The network serves as a model for efficiency, communication, and integration across jurisdictions, especially in rapid response situations. Federal funding for the NPDN network is essential to continue to protect our agriculture jobs and global trade. More importantly, NPDN scientists protect our economic security by fighting against pests and pathogens, sometimes long before they are even detected in the field and have started to do damage. Superheroes do walk among us – protecting us from harm and ensuring that we all have a better tomorrow.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Fort Collins, CO in  Animals  Plants  Dec 14,   APHIS' National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) recently received the Colorado Governor’s Award for High-Impact Research for its development of the GonaConTM Immunocontraceptive Vaccine (GonaCon).  The award was one of four given to Colorado-based labs for their cutting-edge research with global impact. The Colorado state Chief Operating Officer Don Elliman presented the award to NWRC’s Dr. Lowell Miller during a banquet hosted by CO-LABS. CO-LABS is a consortium of research universities, businesses, state and local governments and economic development councils with a mission to educate the public about the value of Colorado's 24 federal research labs. GonaCon is the first single-shot, multi-year immunocontraceptive vaccine for use in mammals. It was registered in by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the first wildlife contraceptive for use in female white-tailed deer.  Not only might this new tool be useful as part of urban white-tailed deer management plans where traditional options are limited, but it also shows promise in other areas, such as disease prevention. GonaCon has been successfully tested in other mammal species, including elk, feral horses, bison, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and feral dogs and cats.  In addition to wildlife management research, NWRC and collaborator studies include the development of a combined GonaCon-rabies vaccine for use in feral dogs and raccoons, contraception for companion animals, and the prevention of adrenocortical disease in pet ferrets and spread of brucellosis in bison.  The vaccine is being used for research purposes in the United States, Mexico, Europe, New Zealand and Australia.  Future NWRC research with GonaCon likely will involve studies to support expanded registration to other species, develop oral delivery systems, and prevent transmission of wildlife diseases.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Jan 09,  Roadside sign promotes Texas recovery attitude. No one knew when Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas on August ates. Texans along the Gulf Coast saw cities demolished, peak wind gusts as high as 130 mph, unprecedented rainfall of more than 50 inches that caused catastrophic flooding in areas, the death of 88 Texans, displacement of thousands of residents and more than $200 million dollars in agricultural losses. Traveling through Refugio to Victoria after Hurricane Harvey I saw the devastation to homes, businesses and the lives of so many – it brought tears to my eyes. Then I saw a sign that summed up Texans’ resilience – “Harvey was strong, Texas is stronger.” I immediately turned around and took a picture. Diebel (left) discuss NRCS assistance options with NRCS District Conservationist Kevin Isom. And strong is what farmers and ranchers have to be in their daily lives faced with the challenges of working in agriculture, especially when dealing with Mother Nature. Rancher Stephen Diebel of Diebel Cattle Company, rode out Hurricane Harvey at his family’s century old ranch in Victoria. He was unsure what devastation the daylight hours would reveal after listening to howling winds and pounding rain throughout the night. He knew it was one of the worst hurricanes he had been through during his time on the ranch. When dawn finally broke, Diebel’s first sight was the twisted metal of outbuildings and barns, sheets of metal like crumpled pieces of paper laying scattered across his pastures. The pastures and roads were covered in water as far as he could see. A sense of relief washed over him after seeing the calves alive and well. He had feared they had been killed when the hay barn collapsed. The calves often sought shade and shelter there. “I was in disbelief that the weather could cause such a mess. It’s hard to comprehend the workload ahead of you,” said Diebel. A busy cow-calf operation with many items on the daily “to-do” list like calf weaning were put on the back burner as the more immediate needs were undertaken by Diebel, his family and ranch crew. Diebel said the hurricane put the operation behind 30 to 45 days on cattle weaning since they had to get power lines fixed and water wells going again. He was able to scout the ranch looking at other damages and found the windmills had taken their last spin during the storm. The bent blades made the systems inoperable. Diebel, whose family has worked with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) on conservation efforts for several generations, realized one of his first calls needed to be to Kevin Isom, district conservationist with NRCS in Victoria. He knew NRCS would likely have assistance available to help replace the windmills with solar water pumps and panels to get the water flowing again. “With the cost of repairing windmills going up each year, it only made sense to take this opportunity to look at improving the efficiency and dependability of our watering systems with solar,” said Diebel. “The NRCS technical assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) have helped make improvements to maximize the land and natural resources, such as brush management, range planting, cross fencing, and conservation enhancements.” He filed an early exemption with NRCS so he was able to obtain bids and start the process of installing the solar pumps and solar panels. The early exemption does not guarantee funding for USDA programs, but it does allow the producer to install the practice before funding is awarded. Thankfully, flooding concerns were less severe on the Diebel ranch. He contributes this to the family’s conservation practices, particularly rotational grazing that keeps pastures covered in forage and builds healthy soil. The healthy soil was able to soak in the rain instead of ponding for days in the fields. As I watched the cattle enjoy the green grass that was abundant after the rain and listened to Diebel talk about how thankful he was that his family and friends were safe, I knew that even when faced with Mother’s Nature’s wrath, he like other Texans would rally together to rebuild and be stronger as a result of Hurricane Harvey.

"Rural Development Arizona Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Jan 24,   Rain poured through the roof of the old Black Canyon, Arizona, fire station, making the floor slippery and rusting the tin that covered the roof. Nonetheless, the one ambulance and fire truck that would fit into the aging metal shed still faired better than the other five vehicles parked outside. Those vehicles were not only pelted by rain and hail, but Arizona’s scorching sun baked them during much of the year—rotting the tires, fading the paint, and drying out the parts and equipment. Parking the vehicles outside also meant that the theft risk was greater, which increased insurance rates. A dilapidated trailer from the 70s was parked next to the shed. Three bunk beds were crammed into the small bedroom for use by fire crews. “It’s hard to recruit firefighters when they have to be housed in those conditions,” said Fire Chief Tom Birch. On January 21, a large crowd gathered to officially cut the ribbon for a new fire station for Black Canyon City. The new building has plenty of room—which means that all of the Department’s vehicles can be parked inside. It also has office space, a reception area, kitchen and three bunk rooms. The total project cost was $1.5 million. USDA Rural Development funded over half of that total. The Fire Department and their long list of building fund contributors made up the difference. That list of community supporters took two full pages of small type to list in the grand opening program. Chief Birch was joined at the ceremony by Fire District Board Members past and present, and the contractor and architect for the new facility. Also on hand were Arizona State Director of USDA Rural Development Alan Stephens, Bureau of Land Management District Manager Angelita Bulletts, Yavapai County Supervisor Tom Thurman and USDA Community Programs Director Leonard Gradillas. “Because of the distances involved in this rural area, our volunteers are to be here at the station during their shifts,” said Birch. “Morale has soared since we got the new station.” The Spacious interior of Black Canyon City Fire Department Building-Residents line up for a potluck meal.  There are lots of other pluses with the new fire station.  The station is built on land close to the interstate for rapid deployment, and because the vehicles can be parked inside, BCCVFD was upgraded to a Class 5 insurance rating—significant because that means lower rates which get passed along to their customers. Three days after Chief Birch and his crew moved into the new fire station, they were called upon to help with a fire in the brush land to the north. “We had a call from the State Forester asking if we could help by providing a pre-stage location for their rapid-response team,” said Birch. “There would have been no way we could have provided that kind of support and assistance before,” he added. “We had the space to be able to accommodate the equipment and the personnel.

"New Resource to Aid Land Managers in Adapting to Climate Change  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .16  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, Feb. 1, — The U.S. Forest Service today released a new report, Effects of Drought on Forests and Rangelands in the United States: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis, that provides a national assessment of peer-reviewed scientific research on the impacts of drought on U.S. forests and rangelands. This report will help the Forest Service better manage forests and grasslands impacted by climate change.""Our forests and rangelands are national treasures, and because they are threatened, we are threatened,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""This report confirms what we are seeing, that every region of the country is impacted by the direct and indirect effects of drought conditions and volatile weather patterns. Sixty million Americans rely on drinking water that originates on our 193 million acres of national forest and grasslands. They support 200,000 jobs and contribute over $13 billion to local economies every year.""The report establishes a comprehensive baseline of available that land managers can use to test how well their efforts to improve drought resilience and adaptation practices are working nationwide. Major findings from the report include: Drought projections suggest that some regions of the U.S. will become drier and that most will have more extreme variations in precipitation. Even if current drought patterns remained unchanged, warmer temperatures will amplify drought effects. Drought and warmer temperatures may increase risks of large-scale insect outbreaks and larger wildfires, especially in the western U.S. Drought and warmer temperature may accelerate tree and shrub death, changing habitats and ecosystems in favor of drought-tolerant species. Forest-based products and values – such as timber, water, habitat and recreation opportunities – may be negatively impacted. Forest and rangeland managers can mitigate some of these impacts and build resiliency in forests through appropriate management actions.""Since , fire seasons have grown longer and the frequency, size and severity of wildland fires have increased,"" said Vilsack. ""Among the many benefits of having this solid baseline is the improved ability to identify where restoration work can help forests adapt and prosper while minimizing the threat and impact of future wildfires.""The assessment, a broad review of existing drought research, provides input to the reauthorized National Integrated Drought Information System ( NIDIS), established by Congress in , and the National Climate Assessment ( NCA), produced every four years to project major trends and evaluate the effects of global climate change on forests, agriculture, rangelands, land and water resources, human health and welfare, and biological diversity. Together these serve as key, science-based, resources for anyone working to maintain or improve public and private lands in the face of a changing environment.Edited by Forest Service scientists in partnership with Duke University, the document provides a valuable new tool to inform discussion, planning and implementation of adaptation strategies for land managers and policy makers. The collaborative effort, authored by 77 scientists from the Forest Service, other Federal agencies, research institutions and universities across the United States, examines ways to understand and mitigate the effects of drought on forests and rangeland including the 193 million acres of National Forest System lands.The implications of the findings of this report are likely to have far-reaching effects on the environment for the foreseeable future. As climate change drives temperatures increases and precipitation patterns change, drought–and associated disturbances such as insect outbreaks and wildfires-will only get worse across many areas of the United States.The mission of the U.S. Forest Service, an agency of the Department of Agriculture, is to sustain the health, diversity and productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations.

Protecting their habitats to help them on their journeys is part of the work that U.S. Forest Service employees across the nation do every day. “Forests and grasslands managed by the U.S. Forest Service are critical to maintaining migratory bird populations, but Forest Service involvement goes well beyond the boundaries of Forest Service lands,” said John Sinclair, National Wildlife Program leader. “By working in local, regional and international partnerships, we conserve migratory bird species and their habitats across the Americas.” One such partner is, Wings Across the Americas, which invests in international conservation efforts. They use Forest Service experience and expertise to improve bird conservation at home and abroad. Scarce federal dollars are leveraged through partnerships with other agencies, non-governmental conservation organizations, local communities and private/corporate sources to ensure long-term sustainable projects that benefit birds throughout their range. The recovery of the Kirtland’s Warbler, a small song bird, is one of the success stories of the Forest Service International Program’s work with Wings Across the Americas.  As recently as , the Kirtland’s Warbler population was at an all-time low. Only 167 singing males were left. Female Kirtland’s warbler on a nest - Huron-Manistee National Forest. Photo by Ron Austing. “The Forest Service and partners forged strong alliances to save this species,” said Sinclair. “All together, they addressed conservation of the Kirtland’s Warbler through sound management practices for the bird and its habitats in the United States and overseas. The result was staggering.  By , there were already more than 2,000 singing males.” As part of ongoing partnerships and Obama's America's Great Outdoors Initiative, federal agencies like the Forest Service, Environment for the Americas and the Bureau of Land Management are working together to train Latino youth in community outreach and bird research techniques through the Celebrando las Aves Playeras (Celebrate Shorebirds) Project. These young interns will be working in Washington, D.C., Oregon, Alaska, Colorado and California on a variety of projects including conservation education, habitat restoration and species monitoring.

"Public Affairs, Siuslaw National Forest in  Forestry  Jun 12,   It was chilly and wet when they arrived in western Oregon, but that didn’t dampen the excitement of the 165 sixth-grade students from six small schools who arrived via yellow buses, pick-up trucks, vans and even a horse trailer at this year’s Forest Camp Outdoor School near the small town of Lebanon. They kicked off the first day with an all-camp meeting where students were introduced to staff, sang songs and learned camp rules. Campers met their counselors (one parent and one high school student) and moved into one of the 19 cabins. Then they spent the afternoon at challenge courses, cabin development classes and listening to encouraging stories to help gear them up for a successful week away from home.

(USFS photo/Jenny Bocko) The rest of the week was spent learning about aquatic ecology, wildland fire, watershed health, how trees grow and the best way to shoot a bow and arrow. Campers spent their time outside of class singing songs, hanging out with new friends and at special evening activities acting in skits, listening to stories from counselors and folk dancing. The week culminated with Wilderness Night, where students and counselors built campfires and created their own shelters out of sheets of plastic and rope. The night brought a little rain but the consensus on Friday morning was that campers had a safe and great time. Forest Camp started in at the Fall Creek Fish Hatchery when employees of the Alsea Ranger District of the Siuslaw National Forest felt that local kids could benefit from more exposure to natural resources. They worked with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Starker Forests and small local schools to formulate a plan that resulted in a successful week long residential camp.

"USDA Seeks Grant Applications for Projects to Test Fruit and Vegetable Incentives  Like other Americans, folks participating in the USDA’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) need to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables. As USDA’s Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, it’s a fact that I recognize and a fact we’re working to address in innovative ways. In recent weeks, USDA requested a new round of applications for grants provided under the Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive (FINI) grant program and launched a handy FINI grantee locator map. The FINI grant program, if you’re unfamiliar with it, was authorized by the Farm Bill and provides grants to test incentive strategies and technologies designed to help SNAP participants better afford fruits and vegetables. It’s collaboratively administered by the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).

"USDA Food and Nutrition Service, Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 18,   I get to learn about a lot of great local initiatives when I make visits around the country.  On a recent trip to Dallas, I visited Metrocrest Social Services, a community resource agency in Farmers Branch, Texas, that provides services to families in crisis and helps them make plans for the future. The purpose of the visit was to learn how outreach workers from the North Texas Food Bank come to this office to assist clients submit applications for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Camilla Zimbal, social services director, gave me a tour of the agency, and showed me some of the other services available to clients. One of the highlights of this one-stop shop is a food pantry at which pantry clients may select groceries once a week. In addition to the canned and boxed food, they can also select fresh-from-the-garden fruit and vegetables. Camilla Zimbal, social services director for Metrocrest Social Services, explains how they get fresh produce for their clients to Audrey Rowe, administrator for Food and Nutrition Service. Community gardeners, farmers and individuals donate locally grown produce weekly to Metrocrest.  Produce is harvested early each Saturday morning from three nearby community gardens and a local high school garden and brought to Metrocrest for volunteers to wash, sort and display in time for a 9 a.m. opening. While clients are limited to once-a-week groceries, they may come in at any time for fresh produce. On a recent Saturday morning, over 40 people came in just for the produce. During peak growing season, when tomatoes and cantaloupes are ripening, even more clients show up for the delicious fresh produce, which is then delivered twice a week. Volunteers at Metrocrest provide recipes and cooking instructions for folks that may not have much experience cooking fresh foods. Recently, frozen chicken was available at the pantry. Volunteers made sure clients went home with some fresh herbs and cooking instructions for the chicken. Those who choose to donate fresh food also enjoy a benefit—providing fresh produce is a great way to give back to the community by helping fight hunger and promote healthy eating. Zimbal gave an example of a local couple in their seventies who picked bushels of ripe peaches from trees in their backyard and brought them to the pantry.  This was a delicious and special treat for clients and a sweet way for the couple to help others. Another example of thoughtfulness was the recent donation of tomato plants so clients could grow their own tomatoes. This kind of local food sharing is a great example of ways farmers and backyard gardeners can give back to the community and help provide healthy food to those in need.

"NRCS Helps to Keep Native American Traditions Alive  The 567 federally-recognized Native American Tribes are unique in their own way—from their languages and family structure, to their clothing and food. Tribes are working hard to revive their roots to help reconnect their heritage to the land, rekindle their spiritual bonds and cultural traditions, and raise awareness amongst future generations; especially tribal youth in line to inherit the land. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with the tribes like the Choctaw Indians, comprised of nearly 10,ates, to farm and harvest hickory king corn and other heirloom white varieties, and process them to make hominy. Hominy is made from dried corn kernels, but it is expensive to purchase.

"Posted by the Equity Team in  Equity  Aug 01,  Growing up in a diverse community in Manhattan, USDA Equity Commission’s Elizabeth Lower-Basch understood the importance of civil rights, unions, and equity at a young age. Inspired by her upbringing, Lower-Basch went on to earn a master’s degree in public policy and began her career with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). At HHS, Lower-Basch worked on cash assistance and learned more about the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the impact it has on millions of people. Lower-Basch’s desire to expand equitable access to food assistance for all who needed it grew from her experience working on SNAP and assisting children, seniors, and working people struggling to put food on the table. Following her time at HHS, Lower-Basch went to the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP) where she currently serves as the Deputy Executive Director for Policy. CLASP works to develop and implement federal, state, and local policies that improve the lives of those in need. In her role, Lower-Basch provides leadership, strategic guidance, and support for the organization’s policy and advocacy agenda. Her work at HHS and CLASP has directly informed her contributions on the Equity Commission where she brought forward recommendations on how USDA can improve its efforts to reduce poverty and promote food and nutrition security. “I’m happy to represent those who cannot afford – or have the capacity to – take on volunteer opportunities such as this [Equity Commission], and to tell their story and advocate for their wellbeing and food security,” she said. The four nutrition-focused recommendations Lower-Basch introduced were shaped by her experience with the community partnership group at CLASP where she heard firsthand how limited or lack of access to programs and services can impact families. In the recommendations, the Equity Commissions asks USDA to continue to encourage state SNAP agencies to administer SNAP in a way that treats applicants and participants with dignity and respect and to consult with those with lived experience of poverty as they administer the programs and provide technical assistance on how to do so. In addition, the Equity Commission recommends the review and update of the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), which forms the basis of SNAP benefits, to reflect the needs of today’s consumers and supporting legislative action to remove eligibility restrictions on SNAP that disproportionately limit access to nutrition supports by Black, indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). “It was important for us to ensure the recommendations were informed by real people with lived experience, not just academia, so that they are actionable and impactful,” Lower-Basch explained. Nutrition programs are especially important during the summer when school is out, and childhood food insecurity is highest. USDA is taking action to address this through its Summer Nutrition Programs, or SUN programs. New for summer , SUN Bucks, also known as Summer EBT, is providing $120 in grocery benefits for eligible kids for the summer. SUN Meals and SUN Meals To-Go are also providing expanded options for kids to get meals at schools, parks and other locations. The expansion of summer benefits and nutrition support is proven to reduce child hunger in the summer by 33% while improving children’s diets. In addition, USDA has made updates to the WIC food program, increased SNAP benefits, improved the nutrition of school meals, expanded access to school meals at no cost to families, and more. All of these actions further the goal of equitable nutrition assistance for those in need, a pillar focus in the Commission’s Final Report. Since the release of the Equity Commission’s Final Report with 66 recommendations, USDA has been partnering with the Commission Members to host Regional Convenings across the country to engage stakeholders in meaningful conversations on agriculture and equity issues as well as opportunities that exist in their region and how USDA can be of service. “These convenings showcase how interconnected we all are and how much USDA does – and can do – for our communities,” Lower-Basch said. “Equity means everyone has a chance. We have an obligation to be pro-active rather than neutral in extending opportunities and supports.” “It’s not just the big policy or recommendation that’s important, it’s the details that matter too,” Lower-Basch concluded. “The equity journey includes making sure steps are being taken to implement the recommendations and policies so that all customers of USDA receive a fair shot at a prosperous, successful life.” The Equity Commission Final Report is available in both English (, 2.0 ) and Spanish (, 1.7 ).

"Undersecretary, USDA Rural Development in  Energy  Rural  Jun 09,   As a farmer in eastern South Dakota, I witnessed one of the biggest growth periods in renewable energy in our country's history. I saw firsthand how the investments in biofuels benefited rural Americans by creating jobs and capturing wealth locally. Leaders in the community got together, made commitments to invest in renewable energy projects, and shared in the success of the projects once they matured. Renewable energy projects are not only good for the rural economy, they are an important component of President Barack Obama's across-the-board approach to building an energy infrastructure. The path he laid out will secure our energy future and promote economic growth by out-innovating and out-competing global competition. Renewable energy production is smart for our country both strategically and economically. As gas prices have gone up, we are reminded that oil supplies are fragile and that global events and speculation can have a large effect on the price. Whether it is tumult in the Middle East or hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico, the long and complex supply chains for petroleum energy can be disrupted by a multitude of events.  This solar module, funded in part through USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program, is oriented to the south on a ground-mounted rack near a rural business in Tippecanoe County, Indiana.  Abundant domestic resources make the expanded use of clean, reliable and American-made renewable energy the best way to mitigate these risks in the long run and take control of gas prices. Producing renewable energy here at home not only increases economic and strategic security, but also provides job growth and captures the wealth of energy production in the communities that produce it. Building on the success of conventional biofuels, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is working with research centers and private businesses to develop new generation biofuels made from feedstocks such as switch grass, corn stover and algae. The promise of new generation biofuels is enormous and provides the greatest hope for our work to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Additionally, USDA is interested in finding ways for rural Americans to use alternative energy technologies that harness the power of wind and sun. The wind that regularly whips through the Great Plains and across Texas can drive turbines that provide energy to individual farms or for sale to the electrical grid. The powerful sun in the American Southwest can heat the solar panels that provide the energy to operate a business or defray the energy costs in a home. One important way we support the effort to expand renewable energy generation and use is through the Rural Energy for America Program. REAP gives rural Americans the opportunity to take the lead in the production of alternative energy by tapping into all of rural America's natural resource strengths. The program supports, among other things, biomass, wind and solar energy projects from applications received from rural small business owners or agricultural producers. Under the REAP program, $61 million has been made available in guaranteed loans and $42 million has been made available for grants. Those funds can be used for various energy efficiency projects including anaerobic digesters on livestock farms, audits of energy improvements and, now, flex-fuel pumps. For additional information, refer to www.rurdev.usda.gov. With tools like the REAP program, USDA is helping rural America lead the way to our nation's renewable energy future. And we can't afford to wait any longer for our economy, our national security, and for prices at the gas pump.

The estimated 60 million gallons of water that falls here in a typical year ends up in the old mines, producing acid mine drainage which is toxic to aquatic life and has a harmful effect on the adjacent riparian vegetation. Over the last fifteen years, the Wayne National Forest and our partners have worked together to restore the watershed, which encompasses 75,000 acres in three counties. In addition to interpreting the natural history of the area, the Forest Service also has the opportunity to educate the public about the importance of continued cleanup of old abandoned mine lands. Numerous features are incorporated in the project’s clean-up activities including: opening all blocked drainages and allowing the water to flow freely from the site, creating a prairie meadow on the upper slope of the site, building a pond stocked by Ohio Department of Natural Resources with three species of fish, and planting approximately 1,300 native species suitable for each habitat created. Partners in the project include: Heavy Equipment Management Program at Hocking College, Monday Creek Restoration Project, Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the Little Cities of Black Diamonds . Communities living along the main stream are now enjoying a renewed sense of pride in their environment, as evidenced by attending partner meetings, participating in volunteer initiatives, and educational outreach programs.

"Wisconsin USDA Rural Development Public Information Officer in  Rural  Jan 04,   The time had come for a community to see what it has built when the Household Abuse Victims Emergency Network (HAVEN, Inc.) recently celebrated the grand opening of their new Domestic Abuse Shelter and Office Facility in the northern Wisconsin community of Merrill. The newly renovated building will provide improved confidentiality and security, more office space and better facilities for staff to meet with clients. The larger shelter includes six bedrooms with a total of 24 beds, more bathrooms, a large new kitchen designed for convenient use by multiple residents, better laundry facilities, and is handicapped accessible. There is also a large living and dining area for residents, a children’s play room and a teen room. The lower level includes a room which can be used for groups or meetings. Established in , HAVEN, Inc. works to support the needs of the community by providing services to children, families, and adults who have been affected by abuse, violence, or sexual assault. When first started, the group used members’ homes for temporary shelters for abuse victims. It bought its first shelter building in . As the need for services grew, it became evident that a new, larger shelter was needed. A convenient building, the former Lincoln County Land Services Building known as ""the Annex"" was vacant with no prospective buyer. With $65,000 in the building fund, the HAVEN Board of Directors made an offer to the County Board for the Annex building, well below the County’s asking price of $249,000. The sale was unanimously approved last February. Through a capital campaign, lead by volunteers, more than a half a million dollars was raised for the rehabilitation project. Community businesses and residents also donated materials, services, time, and furnishings to the new shelter. It was announced at the grand opening event that more than 2,800 volunteer hours were put towards the completion of the new facility. HAVEN, Inc. was also awarded a $100,000 USDA Rural Development Community Facilities Grant for the renovation project. Grant funds were used toward the purchase of furnishings and equipment for the new shelter building including an elevator, sprinkler system, fencing, plumbing fixtures, a new security system, updated phone system, parking lot resurfacing, landscaping and cabinetry.  Additional funding came from the Merrill Housing Authority, WHEDA, the Merrill Community Foundation, private donations and in the form of a cooperative loan provided by three Merrill banks. On behalf of USDA Rural Development, I presented HAVEN, Inc, board members, and staff with an award acknowledging the efforts and leadership used in obtaining the resources to see this project through to completion and for their dedication to improving the quality of life for victims of violence.

"Forest Service Stream Technology Can Prevent Road and Bridge Washouts  Remember the devastating floods in Vermont – the worst in a century – that made national headlines late last August?  Hurricane Irene pounded Vermont and the Green Mountain National Forest and New Hampshire and the White Mountain National Forest with up to 12 inches of rain in less than a day.  Many communities were left reeling from the massive flood damage for weeks and months in post-storm recovery efforts. More than 500 road miles and 200 bridges and culverts were destroyed or damaged.  Communities were left stranded by the flood’s devastation of the transportation infrastructure.  Millions of dollars of property damage occurred.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

"Release & Contact Info  Fact Sheet  Release No. .21  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  On November 2, at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), the United States and United Arab Emirates officially launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) alongside 31 countries and over 48 non-government partners. In remarks at the World Leaders Summit, President Biden announced that the United States intends to mobilize $1 billion in investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years . Previewed at President Biden’s Leaders Summit on Climate in April, AIM for Climate is a pioneering initiative uniquely focused on increasing investment and enabling greater public-private and cross-sectoral partnerships, intended to both raise global climate ambition, and underpin transformative climate action in the agriculture sector in all countries. AIM for Climate has already begun to bear fruit, garnering an “early harvest” of $4 billion in increased investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years. AIM for Climate partners are mobilizing this investment to close the global investment gap in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Climate-smart agriculture is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, while adapting and building resilience to climate change and/or reducing/removing greenhouse gas emissions. AIM for Climate seeks to create incentives for, and mechanisms for maximizing the impact of, new investments toward an agriculture sector that is ready to face a changing climate. Government partners are providing the crucial foundation of AIM for Climate, through a wave of public investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Other sectors, including business, philanthropy, and other non-government partners are invited to build upon that foundation with “innovation sprints” – investments in specific, impactful, measurable, expedited efforts – or by providing critical knowledge for identifying investment gaps, challenges, and opportunities. AIM for Climate has three primary objectives:  Demonstrate collective commitment to significantly increase investment in agricultural innovation for climate-smart agriculture and food systems over five years ;  Support frameworks and structures to enable technical discussions and the promotion of expertise, knowledge, and priorities across international and national levels of innovation to amplify the impact of participants’ investments; and  Establish appropriate structures for exchanges between Ministers, chief scientists, and other stakeholders as key focal points and champions for cooperation on climate-related agricultural innovation, to engender greater co-creation and cooperation on shared research priorities. AIM for Climate focuses on increasing and accelerating investment in, and other support for, climate-smart agricultural innovation in the areas of:  Scientific breakthroughs via basic agricultural research through national-level government and academic research institutions;  Public and private applied research, including through support to international research centers, institutions, and laboratory networks; and  Development, demonstration, and deployment of practical, actionable, and innovative products, services, and knowledge to producers and other market participants, including through national agricultural research extension systems. AIM for Climate government partners announced at COP26 include:  Government Partners  Azerbaijan  Australia  Bahamas  Bangladesh  Brazil  Burkina Faso  Canada  Colombia  Denmark  Finland  Georgia  Ghana  Honduras  Hungary  Ireland  Japan  Kenya  Republic of Korea  Israel  Lithuania  Mexico  Morocco  New Zealand  Philippines  Romania  Singapore  Sweden  United States  United Arab Emirates  United Kingdom  Uruguay  Ukraine  Vietnam A full list of partners and more information on AIM for Climate is available at www.aimforclimate.org. Participation in AIM for Climate is voluntary. Joining AIM for Climate as a Government, Innovation Sprint, or Knowledge Partner does not imply​ endorsement of or partnership between the participants; rather it entails an intention to support the goal and objectives of AIM for Climate. For additional inquiries, please contact press@usda.gov or ClimateComms@state.gov. # USDA is an equal opportunity provider, employer, and lender.",**What strategies are being employed by the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) to mobilize investment and maximize impact in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation?**,"1. **Innovation sprints**: Encouraging business, philanthropy, and other non-government partners to invest in specific, impactful, measurable, expedited efforts. 2. **Public-private partnerships**: Leverage public investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation as a foundation for private sector involvement. 3. **Knowledge sharing**: Identifying investment gaps, challenges, and opportunities through critical knowledge and expertise.

"Public Affairs Specialist for USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 13,  For people suffering from addiction, the chances of recovery are oftentimes only as good as the care they receive. And for decades, the Boxwood Recovery Center in Culpeper, Virginia struggled to provide the high-quality care it was capable of, as it operated out of a deteriorating former roadside motel and restaurant. “Why would you walk into a depressing place when you're probably already in a bad place in your life because of your addiction?” said Kolapo Olarinde, a Program Manager at Boxwood Recovery Center. With a desire to improve the odds of recovery for people in need, Rappahannock Rapidan Community Services (RRCS), the parent nonprofit which operates Boxwood Recovery Center, asked the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development for help. Rural Development was able to help Boxwood with a $3.2 million loan through its Community Facilities Direct Loan & Grant program which provides affordable funding to develop essential community facilities in rural areas. The loan would allow the recovery center to build a state-of-the-art, 21,000 square-foot facility. Boxwood was finally going to have a center worthy of their cause. ""I don't think you can underestimate how important proper facilities are to keep people safe and in recovery,"" said RRCS Executive Director Jim LaGraffe. Today, the Boxwood Recovery Center continues to help many people on their recovery journeys by offering residential alcohol and drug treatment programs with individual, family, and group counseling, educational films, lectures, and relapse prevention.

"Branch Chief, Cooperative Services at USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 30,  This October USDA is celebrating National Cooperative Month, an observance that recognizes the cooperative model, its many influential uses, and how cooperatives benefit their members in numerous ways. There are at least 30,ates providing more than $700 billion to the economy. This year’s theme is Owning Our Identity, a reference to the principles and values that distinguish cooperatives from other business forms. Cooperatives are created by individuals to tackle issues they are unable to solve individually. Co-ops have additional features that make them an attractive option in today’s environment, including the ability to address social justice, create wealth in local communities, encourage self-determination, and build capacity in a community. But cooperatives do not guarantee business success and like other business models require planning and hard work. (View the top myths about cooperatives to learn more!) Cooperatives are made up of members who collectively own, operate, and run the organization, with each member typically getting one vote on decisions. Members are also the customers and use the cooperative services from agriculture marketing, food distribution, mutual purchasing, home care, childcare, real estate, to workers joining together to continue operating businesses that otherwise would have been closed or taken over by competitors. Cooperatives are resilient as evidenced by the fact that 23 percent of the country’s agricultural cooperatives have been in business 100 years or more, 54 percent have been operating for 75 years or more, and 77 percent have been in existence 50 years or more. To achieve such resilience and own their identity, cooperatives have shown they are ready and able to thrive in their communities through the upheavals and changes in the economy; from a pandemic to competition looking to overtake their sectors, and in members’ mindsets that evolve as new generations evolve how cooperatives are run. In celebration of National Cooperative Month, learn more about the resources available at Rural Development to help communities start, sustain, or convert to a cooperative business model:  Interagency Working Group on Cooperative Development: The Interagency Working Group for Cooperative Development, led by USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service, met five times in to uncover how cooperatives operate and benefit local people and communities in the housing, food, child care, real estate investment sectors. For National Cooperative Month, the group hosted a panel discussion featuring cooperative leaders, including newly inducted Cooperative Hall of Fame housing co-op advocate Linda Leaks.  Cooperative Services Branch: Cooperative Services provides support and information for people deciding whether and how to form a co-op. Many of these materials are used by economic development professionals, trade associations, extension educators, youth groups, and agriculture and business schools.  Cooperative Success Stories: Learn more about people who have successfully navigated Rural Development programs and services to help their communities with the cooperative business model. Co-ops are community based, resilient through economic downturns, and ready to help people meet market needs. This October cooperatives are owning their cooperative identity and showing how their values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity distinguish them from other businesses.

Government agencies like USDA can support these efforts by: 1. **Providing resources**: Offering materials, information, and services to help communities start, sustain, or convert to a cooperative business model. 2. **Facilitating collaboration**: Hosting events, panel discussions, and workshops to bring together cooperative leaders and stakeholders to share knowledge and best practices. By supporting cooperatives in this way, government agencies can help these community-based organizations remain resilient and thrive amidst economic upheavals and changes."
"Public Affairs Specialist, Research, Education, and Economics in  Research and Science  Apr 22,  As we celebrate this Earth Day, we want to share a few examples of USDA’s commitment to climate-smart research and scientific investments. USDA science efforts focus on understanding the full range of potential climate impacts, developing science-based solutions, deploying strategies, conducting analyses, creating market opportunities using climate-smart production practices and developing innovative tools for farmers, ranchers and producers. USDA’s Climate Hubs develop and deliver valuable science-based information to agricultural producers and U.S. communities and the Hubs charged with advancing USDA efforts to promote climate-resilient landscapes and rural economic systems. It’s a unique collaboration across USDA and with partnering organizations that brings USDA research into practice. Earlier this year, USDA announced a $9 million investment in Climate Hubs partnerships with Cooperative Extension to bolster climate research and share climate-smart solutions directly with the agricultural community. Under this partnership, projects focus on building net-zero emissions in agriculture on working lands and in communities. USDA launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate — an international initiative that seeks to address climate change and global hunger by uniting participants to significantly increase investment in and support for climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. This effort is vital to protect our planet and enable solutions at the intersection of agriculture and climate. USDA also plays an important role in supporting clean energy. USDA joined the government-wide Sustainable Aviation Fuels Grand Challenge to enable scale-up of the production and use of sustainable aviation fuels to meet 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand by . USDA researchers are developing Earth-friendly agricultural feedstocks to support this effort. These USDA-supported efforts—among many others—are part of USDA’s commitment to transform our nation’s food and energy systems in climate-smart ways that will protect our planet for generations to come.

"USDA Rural Development State Director for New York in  Rural  Apr 17,  I recently traveled to Torrey, New York to break ground on the town’s first-ever water district. This project has been more than 20 years in the making and it will improve the health and lives of people living in rural parts of the state. It will also improve the water quality and conservation efforts on the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The town received $2.4 million in funding through USDA Rural Development’s Water and Environmental Program (WEP). Once completed, this project will bring safe and reliable water to more than 40 households. I was joined by town and community leaders – both past and present – as well as the engineers from Clark Patterson Lee and Nardozzi construction teams who will be building out the new waterline. “The residents in this area have trouble with water from the lake or their wells are prone to dry out,” Town Supervisor Peter Martini said. “Some of the wells are inadequate for residential use. Once reliable wells are getting less reliable. If everything goes as planned, residents should have water from the new line by this summer.” As Earth Day approaches, projects like this one make me proud to invest in our planet and in rural America. It is an example of how USDA is partnering with rural communities to build critical infrastructure that will create jobs for people across the state and the nation. Every community needs access to modern water and wastewater systems – especially rural residents and businesses throughout New York state. USDA is proud to celebrate Earth Day to show how we are investing in locally driven solutions like this one in rural New York to expand access to safe water and reliable wastewater infrastructure, renewable energy and essential services that create jobs, build critical infrastructure and create sustainable futures for rural America.

"in Rural  Apr 19,  It’s a human right to have access to clean water and reliable wastewater systems. USDA Rural Development finances projects to build strong infrastructure to help people in rural America thrive and create economic opportunities. This week, as we celebrate Earth Day, we are proud to highlight some of the many ways USDA programs advance climate-smart infrastructure to help people have a more accessible, affordable and safe water supply. Water Independence Comes to a Rural Community in Missouri For six years, Public Water Supply District No. oddard County purchased water from a nearby community. USDA Rural Development awarded $2.6 million under the Water & Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program to make improvements to the district's drinking water production, storage and distribution system. This project is expected to enable the district to provide community members quality water from its own systems. The project will help the district drill two wells in areas with good water quality. That will help reduce operational costs because the water will require less treatment. The funds will also be used to install meters to reduce water loss and more accurately record the amount of water each customer uses. Wastewater System Upgrades Improve Health and Safety for People in Rural Tennessee The town of Baxter is improving the health and safety of the community’s residents. The town used a loan and grant totaling to $3 million through the Water and Waste Disposal Program Loan and Grant program to upgrade its wastewater treatment to provide safe and clean wastewater services to 1,350 people. The improvements will upgrade a sewer pump station and other infrastructure needs. Safe Drinking Water for Tribal and Underserved Rural Communities in Minnesota USDA Rural Development awarded the Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa Indians a loan and grant totaling to $8 million under the Water and Waste Disposal Program to make improvements to the Mahnomen community water system on the Fond du Lac Reservation in Carlton County. This project will replace two water wells, a water treatment plant and water distribution lines. The funds also will be used to build a water tank. These improvements will ensure that the Tribe’s water system is safe for the 620 residents it serves.

"Acting National Coordinator for USDA Climate Hubs, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy in  Climate  Farming  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 08,  In June , Secretary Vilsack outlined a vision for agricultural solutions to environmental challenges, which included creating the Regional Climate Hubs. In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests. Early career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. “Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said. “Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said. The Climate Hubs continue to build capacity to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests.

"NIFA, Writer/Editor in  Research and Science  Apr 20,  Feeding a world population estimated to exceed 9 billion by will require significant increases in agricultural production, yet those increases must be sustainable solutions that protect the world’s natural resources. As USDA’s primary extramural funding agency, the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) invests in research, education and Extension efforts to ensure a secure food supply while protecting and enhancing the world’s natural resources. NIFA’s Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) is the nation’s leading competitive grants program for agricultural sciences. AFRI-funded science is vital to meeting food, fiber and fuel demands as the global population expands while safeguarding the world’s land and water resources. NIFA is working to transform American agriculture to increase production in sustainable ways and doing so in the context of diminishing land and water resources and a changing climate. Examples of NIFA-Supported Research Advancing Climate-Smart Ag:  Researchers at Auburn University have identified two genes that appear to coordinate the fitness of plants in defending themselves from drought while also stimulating growth. The genes will likely be good candidates to help generate crops that are truly drought tolerant.  University of California scientists are developing new instruments and analysis techniques that will provide insights into the sources and chemistry of atmospheric aerosols and the role they play in global climate and regional air pollution.  Rutgers University showed that increased concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide could lead to changes in soil structure. Researchers are helping develop better crop fertilization and irrigation practices that maximize yields while minimizing soil and water contamination from excess nutrients.  A microclimate study conducted by West Virginia State University Extension Service is helping landowners learn more about climate change impact on regional weather, with the goal of minimizing negative impact on seasonal crops and overall farm livelihood.  At North Dakota State University, researchers developed web-based nitrogen calculators for more efficient nitrogen management without decreasing crop yields in crops like wheat, canola, barley and sugar beets. NIFA and the projects it supports are crucial to feeding the world and protecting the Earth for future generations.

"Chief Officer, OCIO Enterprise Management Center (EDMC) in  Technology  Apr 22,  The USDA recently wrapped up a successful hackathon at Colorado State University. This event, which brought together computer science and science students around a real USDA challenge, is a prime example of the many benefits that hackathons can offer. But what exactly is a hackathon, and why are they so beneficial? A hackathon is an intensive event where participants collaborate to create solutions to specific problems. The fast-paced environment of a hackathon encourages creativity, innovation, and teamwork. By bringing together people from different backgrounds and disciplines, hackathons can foster cross-pollination of ideas and lead to the development of solutions that might not have been possible otherwise. From April 4-6, representatives from USDA joined CSU at the downtown Fort Collins, CO campus, bringing together staff from USDA-OCIO, Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS), CSU’s Computer Sciences and Animal Sciences programs, and the Ram Hack student organization to conduct the 24-hour hackathon. USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small provided pre-recorded remarks, and the USDA Chief and AI Officer Christopher Alvares kicked off the event. Our event with CSU was developed around a real-world artificial intelligence use case for AMS. AMS is pursuing ways to expand their meat grading service and want to explore the use of image processing and artificial intelligence. Over 60 CSU students across 18 teams were challenged to develop predictive models that could accurately estimate beef grade (e.g. Prime, Choice, Select) and fat thickness using images of beef ribeye's as they would appear to an AMS meat grader. Representatives from USDA provided technical assistance to many of the hackathon’s participants. Six teams were recognized for their accomplishments and will also receive letters of appreciation and an opportunity to meet with AMS on their project. Prior to the start of the hackathon, a career fair was held with representatives from OCIO’s Office of the Chief Officer, Cybersecurity and Privacy Operations Center, Client Experience Center, and Digital Infrastructure Services Center. Representatives discussed core professional skills, resume tips, and internship opportunities at USDA. Students also heard about programs such as the US Digital Corps, GSA’s two-year tech fellowship program and a partner of USDA. We hope to strengthen relationships with CSU and other universities to not only help address real USDA problems, but also inspire students and learners through hackathon events to hone their skills and consider a tech career in USDA and public service.

"Expanding Affordable Healthcare in Rural South Carolina  Having access to quality health care is often a problem for low-income patients who live in rural communities. Fortunately, there are medical facilities such as Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc in Lugoff, South Carolina that work on a sliding fee scale, which means that all their patients, regardless of income level, can afford quality health care. However, this has also increased their number of patients over time, and it wasn’t long before they recognized that their Lugoff office was running out of space.  Stephanie Bittiker, USDA Rural Development Public Information Officer  Posted in  Equity  Rural  Sep 16,   Respond to this story",How have expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical increased patient care demands?,"The expanded affordable healthcare options at Sandhills Medical Foundation, Inc. have led to an increase in their patient volume, resulting in space constraints at their Lugoff office."
"of Agriculture Xochitl Torres Small in  Equity  Aug 01,  Since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has advanced equity by listening to the people we serve and learning how we can serve them better by removing barriers to our programs and services. USDA offices and agencies have developed key actions to comprehensively incorporate equity into the Department’s services, which touch every American’s life. USDA Rural Development’s Equity Action Plan was one of the last projects I worked on as Under Secretary of that mission area. So I know firsthand how hard USDA staff have worked to make change. Now in my new role as Deputy Secretary, I am thrilled to share the release of 14 Equity Action Plans that encompass the work across all of USDA. These plans follow the lead of President Biden’s Executive Order 1, which insists that federal agencies use all the policy levers we have to make progress. Founded on the insight that our country is stronger when everyone participates, and more vulnerable when people are left out, the plans released today are part of our relentless focus to shape USDA to truly be what President Lincoln called us, the People’s Department. While the plans are ambitious, I know they are achievable. The plans share both accomplishments and actions underway. A few examples of the accomplishments include:  Simplified direct farm loan application processes. The Farm Service Agency drastically reduced the burden and time necessary for farmers and ranchers applying for loans. FSA has also rolled out a loan assistance tool that helps farmers and ranchers better navigate the farm loan application process.  Regional Food Business Centers. A dozen Food Business Centers will support a more resilient, diverse, and competitive food system. These Centers—led by partners who include the Mississippi Delta Council for Farmworker Opportunities, the Georgia Minority Outreach Network, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council—will support producers by providing localized assistance to access local and regional supply chains, including linking producers to wholesalers and distributors.  Rural Partners Network – The Rural Partners Network (RPN) is an alliance of federal agencies and commissions, led by USDA Rural Development, working directly with rural communities to expand rural prosperity through job creation, infrastructure development, and community improvement.  Embracing Tribal Sovereignty. The Forest Service has embraced Tribal self-determination principles, releasing the USDA Forest Service Action Plan: Strengthening Tribal Consultations and Nation-to-Nation Relationships, and furthering co-stewardship agreements.  Microfarms at RMA — The Risk Management Agency (RMA) issued a Micro Farm policy to provide additional insurance options for small-scale producers. The policy development process included obtaining feedback from small-scale producers that have grown products for their local communities. But of course there’s still plenty of room for improvement. Some of our plans include:  Increasing access to nutrition programs. FNS will support State and local partnerships to increase the reach of nutrition programs in underserved communities and will continue to expand online shopping. And it will move forward on nationwide implementation of the new Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer program, which will provide grocery-buying benefits to low-income families with school-aged children when schools are closed for the summer.  Expanding Urban and Community Forestry Benefits. The Forest Service will increase access to urban forestry benefits.  Improving Civil Rights processes. USDA's civil rights office will continue to improve civil rights complaint processes; it will eliminate complaint backlogs, meet ambitious timeliness goals going forward, and implement a fast-track emergency intervention program complaint process to allow timely solutions in cases that involve urgent needs.  Enhancing capacity of minority-serving institutions. Research, Education, and Economics will increase stakeholder engagement to identify research needs, enhance research collaboration, offer new grant programs, and invest in facilities and workforce development to help build capacity.

"Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19?  Last year, as COVID-19 rattled the world economy and disrupted trade flows, agricultural trade remained mostly stable, falling only two percent during the initial wave of infections and lockdowns, before bouncing back and ending the year up 3.5 percent. But the growth in agricultural trade doesn’t mean that trade flows were insulated from the effects of the pandemic. Much of was in fact shaped by other factors. For instance, 95% of global agricultural trade growth came from China and was driven in part by non-pandemic related factors of increased feed demand, efforts to restock grain reserves, and policy factors. A recent paper by USDA’s Office of the Chief Economist, Has Global Agricultural Trade been Resilient under COVID-19? Findings from an Econometric Assessment (, 1.4 ) (Arita et al.), suggests that while agricultural trade remained stable at the aggregate level, a deeper empirical analysis reveals there were still significant disruptions due to the pandemic.

"USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Climate  Farming  Technology  Trade  Aug 09,  Accurate crop mapping is a crucial process to informing reliable crop production estimates, addressing climate change, and developing strategies for sustainable agriculture. U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service is working with university students in Tanzania on a pilot project to gather grassroots to strengthen community agricultural systems and improve crop condition assessments with satellite imagery. Their field work is adding truth from the ground up to the sky. In April, 14 YouthMappers spent four days in the Arusha area capturing on 334 fields by photographing, georeferencing, and identifying target crops to enhance FAS satellite imagery analysis. YouthMappers is an international network of university-based chapters that organize and implement mapping activities in response to global and local development needs. “The YouthMappers’ chapters are products under USAID, which empower youth to help their community,” said Gideon G. Sway, one of the Tanzania YouthMappers. The FAS-YouthMappers team’s main objective was to create an agricultural library of ground-truth from the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. This activity is the first time YouthMappers has used its members’ skills to strengthen agricultural . While Tanzania grows several kinds of crops, making this a viable machine learning project the team to focus on locating target crops of FAS’ International Production Assessment Division (IPAD). Oftentimes, crops are grown together in larger fields and can be detectable by freely available satellite imagery. In addition to geo-locating these crops, the team’s field work revealed variability in crop heights and exposed pest damage—especially from the fall army worm. This future-facing project improves understanding of crop conditions and the impact of seasonal rains. Since the project began, the Tanzanian YouthMappers network has collected from 1,700 fields in the Arusha, Dodoma, and Mwanza regions. Thanks to YouthMappers, FAS can now pair satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 with the field . In May, these YouthMappers, trained additional university students on geo-mapping with ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, and Kobo Collect to help advance Tanzanian agriculture and achieve project goals for the Dodoma and Mwanza regions. The Tanzania partnership is part of FAS efforts to help develop young agricultural leaders to strengthen Africa’s self-development and capacity building. Be on the lookout for this group’s presentation next month at the Africa Food Systems Forum. The goal of the Forum is for public, private, and non-profit groups to strengthen African agricultural and food systems via inclusivity, sustainability, resiliency, and equity.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Dec 01,  There are only a few things in life that can bring together and excite a global community, and food and sports are two of those things! USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is tapping into these uniting experiences by shining a spotlight on high-quality, safe, delicious, and sustainably produced U.S. foods during the FIFA World Cup, underway in Qatar. This groundbreaking effort, organized by FAS’s Office of Agricultural Affairs in Dubai and the U.S. Embassy in Qatar, is introducing nearly 130,000 visitors per day to the great variety and quality of U.S. foods at the USA Pavilion. Located in the heart of Doha, in a fan zone featuring international pavilions, visitors to the USA Pavilion feel as though they’re being transported to the States through the sights, sounds, and smells of everything U.S. agriculture has to offer – including food/ag, education, and tourism. “It’s our mission at the World Cup to introduce the world to our true MVPs, America’s farmers and ranchers who work every day to grow and produce safe, nutritious, sustainable, and delicious foods and ingredients to feed and nourish the world,” said USDA Agricultural Counselor Valerie Brown. “We’ve put together a dream team of U.S. food and commodity groups and celebrity chefs who are looking to score new fans as they kick things up with cooking demonstrations, competitions, and giveaways featuring U.S. ingredients – everything from healthy treats for athletes to decadent game day foods for fans and families. Whether visitors want to learn how to make nutritious snacks with U.S. fruits, nuts, and cheese, or something more indulgent like barbeque, gumbo, and ice cream desserts, the USA Pavilion will offer food lovers from around the world a field of options – all thanks to America’s farmers and ranchers.” According to the latest trade , U.S. food and agricultural exports to the world, and the Middle East in particular, increased last fiscal year (). In , U.S. farmers and ranchers exported a record $196.4 billion of food and agricultural products to the world, of which $6.6 billion was exported to the Middle East, up 20 percent from the prior year. Consumer demand for U.S. foods and ingredients is growing in the region, especially for U.S. tree nuts, dairy products, and beef and beef products, a few of the many ingredients being showcased at the World Cup USA Pavilion in Qatar. “This year the World Cup may be more than 7,ates, but FAS is proudly representing Team USA and our food and ag MVPs back home,” added Brown. “Visitors to the USA Pavilion will travel on a food and ag tour across our wonderful country as their senses discover ingredients and products from Virginia and Louisiana, to Texas, California, Hawaii, and other amazing states in between.

"The Electronic Government Act of was signed into law on December 17, . ""Electronic Government""(E-GOV) is defined as the Government use of ""web-based Internet applications or other information technology to enhance the access to and delivery of government information and services to the public, other agencies, and other Government entities; or to bring about improvements in Government operations that may include effectiveness, efficiency, service quality, or transformation."" The E-Government Act of established a new agency within the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Electronic Government, which is responsible for electronic information management and for promoting interagency cooperation to improve public services. The act creates a Chief Information Council that works with other Federal agencies and State and local governments to help develop electronic technology policies, requirements, and strategies. An E-Government Fund was also established to provide funding for projects intended to allow for easier public access to information, improved government services and transactions, and enhanced agency information technology project coordination and planning. The E-GOV initiatives serve citizens, businesses, and Federal and state government employees by delivering high quality services more efficiently at a lower price. Instead of expensive “stove piped” operations, agencies work together to develop common solutions which achieve mission requirements at reduced cost, thereby making resources available for higher priority needs. USDA currently participates in 14 Presidential E-GOV Initiatives and Lines of Business (LoB).  By participating in the E-GOV Initiatives and LoBs, USDA has improved its business processes and program delivery to its customers, employees, and partners.  Through these efforts, USDA has been able to work with other Federal agencies to streamline common areas of business delivery (e.g. rulemaking, payroll, and grants management) and learn from best practices throughout the government.  The Department will continue to implement these Initiatives and LoBs to achieve further benefits for its customers. The OCIO E-GOV Office serves as USDA’s focal point for E-GOV Presidential Initiatives and Lines of Business, as well as the USDA liaison to the Office of Management and Budget regarding E-GOV. The office provides oversight and guidance to the development and implementation of USDA-wide policies, standards, and procedures for E-GOV implementations. The office manages USDA’s E-GOV relationships with other Federal agencies. It identifies and promotes common enterprise solutions to enable improvements in USDA’s business, information, and technology infrastructures to reduce overall funding requirements.  It also provides leadership in addressing and resolving IT department-wide issues and obstacles to achieving E-GOV objectives.","What is the primary goal of the Electronic Government Act's Office of Electronic Government in promoting interagency cooperation, implementing initiatives, and making resources available across government agencies?","The primary goal of the Electronic Government Act's Office of Electronic Government is to improve public services, make resources available for higher priority needs, and reduce costs by enabling agencies to work together to develop common solutions."

"Information Technology (IT) plays a critical role in the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) ability to carry out its mission to “…provide leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management.” Each year the complexity of the IT environment grows, and making sound IT investment decisions requires greater amounts of information. For example, the Department improves the Nation’s economy and quality of life by touching the lives of almost every person in America, every day. Nearly 100,000 employees deliver more than $144 billion in public services through the Department’s more than 300 programs worldwide, providing leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on sound public policy, the best available science, and efficient management. USDA needs to respond effectively to the challenges posed by the diversity, complexity, and volume of IT investment proposals brought forward by various stakeholders throughout the Department. This new integrated IT governance framework supports government priorities and program delivery. USDA’s Integrated Information Technology Governance Framework (IITGF) is a holistic set of processes, procedures, and that assist the Office of the Chief Information Officer’s (OCIO’s) customers improve mission delivery. It does this by providing structure around the budget formulation, budget execution, enterprise architecture, capital planning, IT security, Section 508, Records Management, and portfolio/project management processes. Implementing the IITGF satisfies the following goals:  Provides a coherent and effective project management methodology to guide IT project management at USDA. The methodology is intended to consistently deliver IT capabilities that provide maximum support to USDA business needs within approved cost and schedule constraints.  Better integrates IT project planning and execution with IT Governance, including more effective multi-disciplinary reviews of IT projects by the stakeholders and IT executive governance bodies. The IITGF includes touch points with other USDA’s governance, management, and control activities and processes, such as: Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC), Agriculture’s System Development Life Cycle (AgSDLC) approach, Project Management (PM), Enterprise Architecture (EA), Risk Management Framework (RMF), and IT Security. Implementing an Integrated IT Governance Framework further supports the USDA mission by providing the alignment for decisions with needed technology components, services, and applications. An important objective of the IITGF Life Cycle is to provide flexibility that allows for tailoring of artifacts, decision gate reviews, and governance board reviews to suit the characteristics of a particular solution development effort. If tailoring is approved in advance by the governance board, these alternative development approaches empower project managers to tailor tasks in order to meet the specific needs of the project while maintaining compliance with the AgSDLC and IITGF governance processes. Some of the most popular, time and cost effective alternative development models are: Rapid Application Development (RAD), Pilot Development, Iterative, Agile, Government off the Shelf (GOTS)/Commercial off the Shelf (COTS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

"Who Are We? The Enterprise Architecture Division provides a planning concept and delivery process designed to help translate business strategies into mission results. We leverage as a strategic asset so that architecture becomes a tool to make -driven decisions that optimize resources, identify duplication, and cost saving opportunities. The EAD team supports the creation of an integrated, tiered Enterprise Architecture (EA) that supports improved planning and risk management at both the agency and Department levels. Additionally, the team supports standardization on common computing platforms to enhance interoperability and reduce cost of ownership; and improving the USDA’s planning and decision-making by more closely aligning EA activities to the IT Capital Planning processes. EAD provides and maintains for USDA a centralized EAVE (Enterprise Architecture Visioning Environment) that aligns IT assets to the Federal Enterprise Architecture reference models. Through its collection and reporting capabilities, the EAVE enables organizations to better identify collaboration, modernization and transformation opportunities. The EAD reinforces the adoption and documentation of technical standards, making it easier for USDA agencies to realize economies-of-scale cost savings based on aggregated purchases of like products and services. Additionally, the EA helps USDA identify opportunities for business reuse and sharing of existing infrastructure and services, reducing operational and overhead costs. What Do We Do? Enterprise Architecture gives the Department a bird’s eye view of the whole organization – and the ecosystem in which it operates both at a high level and detailed level as it matures overtime. EA is unique from other disciplines within the IT Management Framework in that it:  Encompasses the whole mission and operational scope of the Department  Represents the Department’s ecosystem at a high level of detail  Is based on a metamodel comprised of modular components making it reusable across the practice area in a wide range of scenarios Enterprise Architecture informs and translates strategies and business model changes into a set of coordinated actions needed to make them real via a roadmap. It has a special role between IT Strategy and IT Execution. Consider it a bridge between the two as it defines priorities and scope for translating strategy into operational reality.  Enabling an Actionable Architecture - Supports Agencies in making informed decisions concerning technology investments by implementing an “actionable architecture” which takes enterprise architecture from being a goal and moves it to becoming a platform for decision support. Actionable architecture brings architecture to the forefront as a way to centralize and visualize relationships among systems, people, processes and to make smarter decisions.

"Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) is a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating information technology investments. Optimizing the Performance of IT Investments Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) is a systematic approach to selecting, managing, and evaluating information technology investments. CPIC is mandated by the Clinger Cohen Act of which requires federal agencies to focus on the results produced by IT investments. Here’s how we guide our clients through the CPIC lifecycle: Pre-Select Phase—Executive decision-makers assess each proposed investment’s support of USDA’s strategic and mission needs. Project managers compile the information necessary for supporting a detailed investment proposal. Select Phase—Investment analyses are conducted and the members of the E-Board choose the IT projects that best support USDA’s mission and enterprise architecture. Control Phase—USDA ensures, through timely oversight, quality control, and executive review, that IT investments are executed or developed in a disciplined, well-managed, and consistent manner. Evaluate Phase—Actual results of the implemented projects are compared to planned results to assess investment performance. Once investments are implemented, actual versus expected results are evaluated to: assess the investment's impact on strategic performance; identify any changes or modifications to the investment that may be needed; and revise the investment management processes based on lessons learned, self-assessments and benchmarking.

"Communications Director, USDA Rural Development, Tennessee in  Energy  Rural  Feb 01,   USDA Business and Cooperative Programs Administrator Judith Canales convened a roundtable of renewable energy experts from the southeast in Nashville on January 26, to discuss development and marketing of bioenergy technologies and advanced biofuels. Despite an unexpected snow the night before, participants traveled in from Memphis and Knoxville as well as Middle Tennessee. FSA and Rural Development State Directors Gene Davidson and Bobby Goode hosted the Administrator and Ed Harlan of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Louis Buck of Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative, Pete Nelson of Memphis Bioworks, Atha Comiskey and Bart Comiskey of Clean Cities of Middle Tennessee, Paul Melgaard of Eco Energy, Terry Ruse of Clean Fuels Development Coalition, Warren Nevad of the Tennessee Renewable Energy Economic Council, Dan Stasser of the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Stan Boyd and David Owenby of the Tennessee Department of Transportation and Rural Development Tennessee Energy Programs Coordinator Will Dodson. Canales opened the forum with the idea that, ""By making renewable energy sources commercially viable based on feed stock available in each region of the country, we create sustainable opportunities for job creation and economic development, and keep more energy dollars in the community."" The spirited discussion covered a range of challenges on the horizon for the emerging bioenergy industry from traditional fuel providers to misperceptions about the tradeoff between food and fuel crops. Canales emphasized that changes are coming to the USDA energy programs that will allow applications to be submitted year round and to encourage geographic and technological diversity. Canales and others brought up the regional nature of biofuel production. Regionally significant feed stocks mentioned included cellulosic switch grass, wood pulp and sucrose-rich crops. With the commercial availability of existing flex fuels growing rapidly, participants called for a fresh examination of regulations intended to encourage their use. ""Greater use helps drive down production costs and will encourage more stations to carry fuels like E20, E30 and E85 as they come online,"" said Goode. ""We can help drive the change to cleaner fuels by doing more to take advantage of flex fuels in fleet vehicles and by educating consumers on the benefits of using more renewable American-made energy resources."" Coop Manager Louis Buck said that with the advances being made in bioenergy production today he looks forward to a time when farmers send power down wires to the city and get a check delivered back in the mail. Electronic mail, presumably. During the roundtable, Canales also announced the award of a $25,000 Rural Energy for America (REAP) grant to the Tennessee Biomass Supply Cooperative. According to Buck, ""The investment will be used for research into commercializing a new, more efficient technology for generating hydrogen from what is typically regarded as low-potential biomass feed stock.""

"Missouri State Director and George Thomas, Public Information Coordinator in  Energy  Rural  Apr 14,   To “flex” or not, that is a good question.  I own a flexible fuel vehicle and have for several years and as a Government Agency, Rural Development has government owned vehicles that accommodate flexible fuel.  As State Director, I travel throughout Missouri and even though I have the appropriate vehicle and even though there is an adequate supply of renewable fuels, there is an inadequate number of service stations that have flexible fuel pumps.  Compound this with the desire to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and make our nation more environmentally clean, you can imagine my reaction when Rural Development announced a program as part of the solution to address these issues. There was excitement in Jefferson City, Missouri’s State Capitol, when Judith Canales, Administrator for USDA Rural Development Rural Business-Cooperative Programs kicked off  Rural Development’s  Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) workshop on flex-fuel options.  Canales informed the 45 people in attendance that grants are available to provide fuel station owners with incentives to install flexible fuel pumps that will offer Americans more renewable energy options. Pictured left to right: John Eggleston, Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Bradley Schad, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Judith Canales, USDA Rural Business-Cooperative Service Administrator; Matt Amick, Missouri Corn Growers Association; Gary Wheeler, Missouri Corn Growers Association; and Janie Dunning, USDA Rural Development Missouri State Director The event was hosted by the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives and their Secretary/Treasurer, John Eggleston, (also a 30-year pioneer of the ethanol industry in Missouri).  He  emphasized the importance of ethanol as a renewable energy source in reducing America’s dependency on foreign oil. Matt Moore, Director Business Programs for Missouri Rural Development (RD), illustrated that the REAP incentives offer options for financing the conversion of fuel stations pumps or installation of new flex fuel pumps resulting in a choice for Missourians when purchasing fuel in the future. The REAP incentives can be coupled with $5,000 incentives offered from both Growth Energy and the Missouri Corn Growers Association according to Bradley Schad, Director of Ethanol Blends with the Missouri Corn Growers Association. Other stakeholders in attendance that provided comments in support of the renewable energy programs included: Loyd Wilson, Division Director for Missouri Department of Agriculture; J.P. Dunn, Missouri Soybean Association;   Tom May,  Marketing Director for MFA Oil Company;  retailers, flex fuel pump distributors and others. As a highlight, the Missouri Corn Growers brought to the meeting a flex fuel pump for all the attendees and media to see. During the Question and Answer session of the meeting, it was pointed out that a small convenience store chain was exploring the possibility of putting new fuel dispensers in at several of their locations. Canales summed up the day by saying, “I want to make certain that everyone is aware of the variety of assistance USDA Rural Development provides to help businesses create jobs and become energy more efficient. This assistance builds on the Obama Administration’s commitment to ‘Win the Future’ by ensuring the Nation develops innovative ways to meet our future energy needs.” Administrator Canales explains the provisions of USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program during an appearance in Missouri  Category/Topic:  Energy  Rural  Tags:  Energy  Jefferson City  Judith Canales  Matt Moore  Missouri  REAP  Renewable Energy  Rural Development","**What funding sources and incentives are available for fuel station owners to install flexible fuel pumps in Missouri, as part of the USDA's Rural Energy for America Program (REAP)?**","* Grants from the USDA's Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) * $5,000 incentives offered by both Growth Energy and the Missouri Corn Growers Association."

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Conservation  Feb 24,  Red-backed salamanders and other amphibians are key players in ecosystem health. (iStock photo) Forested areas that border wetlands help protect wildlife, but until recently their efficacy has been untested for most amphibian species.  Now, recently published results of a six-year study explore how the loss or reduction of amphibians could affect the ecosystem. At the University of New Hampshire, Dr. Kimberly Babbitt and a team of graduate students conducted landscape-scale experiments that tested the impacts of forest buffer width vernal pools on population size and structure, body size and condition and population genetics of two amphibian species in the northeastern United States. A grant from USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supported the project. The investigation examined the response of spotted salamanders and wood frogs in three environments: wetlands surrounded by either intact forest, a 30-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut, and a 100-meter forest buffer surrounded by a 100-meter clearcut. The study indicates that areas with smaller buffers had negative impact on size and condition of salamanders and frogs. Analysis of genetic relatedness indicated that, despite logging, populations across the broader landscape are well-connected. Babbitt and doctoral student Danial Hocking also examined the role of amphibians in forest floor ecosystem function and conducted a review of amphibian contribution to ecosystem services. “We found that amphibians contribute in a variety of ways to human societies,” Babbitt said.  “We are examining the roles in different forest types to understand under what context salamanders can influence ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth.” Some of the beneficial effects of amphibians on the ecosystem are known, such as the ability of tadpoles reduce eutrophication (greening) by consuming excess algae.  In many ecosystems means that amphibians have important roles both as food sources and as predators – amphibians feed heavily on mosquitoes, making them an important line of defense against mosquito-borne diseases, including the West Nile virus.  Babbitt noted many that amphibians have a lot more to offer – if we can ensure their survival. “Although yet to result in approved pharmaceuticals, amphibian skin secretions have shown the ability to inhibit HIV transmission and provide stronger analgesic effects than opioids,” she said. “Learning from these chemical secretions could lead to breakthroughs in human medicine. However, amphibians are declining across the globe and species are going extinct. It’s important to protect species before potential advances are lost.” NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.  Greater understanding of how forest buffers can protect the amphibians that serve the ecosystem is important knowledge that will help states, communities, and landowners make more informed decisions about land use and management, Babbitt said.

During and after the session Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Cheryl Cook heard accounts of how local Rural Development staff have made a difference in the economic health of rural communities in states including Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Many described the positive impact of investments made through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act over the last two years, but expressed concern for the future. Water systems, broadband access, and fire and rescue capabilities were frequently cited as critical foundational investments every community needs. But many said finding private partners willing to lend on affordable terms is a challenge for smaller communities that have a limited tax base. A number of elected officials said that increasing the availability of private capital for existing and start-up businesses, improving educational and healthcare opportunities, and helping develop renewable energy options were all key to strengthening local economies through diversification. Many also praised the local knowledge and accessibility of RD’s network of staff members who regularly visit nearly every county in the nation. “Most of us have full time day-jobs and serve our communities as best we can,” explained one local leader from northeast Pennsylvania. “Without the technical assistance from our regional Rural Development Office I doubt we could get through the application process successfully. And that’s assuming we could even keep track of when funding is available for the infrastructure our town needs.” Cook described Rural Development as, “Three agencies on a mission, using loans, loan-guarantees and leveraging grants,” to make it affordable for small towns to keep up with advances in technology, provide necessary infrastructure, and to attract the pool of business investment capitol often taken for granted in larger cities. “One of the great things at Rural Development is that we make it affordable for rural communities to help themselves,” she said. “And by being hands-on from the start, we set them up for success.” According to Cook that means nearly all the investments RD makes get paid back with interest. “So, even as budgets get tighter, the capacity of our community facilities programs is able to grow to meet the needs of the many small towns struggling to survive.” “We want to Rural America to do more than just get by; we want these communities to thrive as the American economy recovers,” said cook.

"Rural Development State Director, New Jersey in  Initiatives  Rural  Oct 29,   After struggling for several years with a stagnant economy, the future is looking brighter for Paulsboro, New Jersey.  Earlier this week, USDA Rural Development Deputy Under Secretary Cheryl Cook, Assistant Administrator for the Water and Environmental Program Jacki Ponti, and I attended an event to celebrate a Recovery Act-funded water project that will help to stimulate job creation while also upgrading Paulsboro’s water system. The diverse borough of Paulsboro houses just over 6,000 residents and faces many of the same challenges of rural towns across the country.  In recent years, the decreasing demand for fuel spurred a number of oil refinery layoffs, displacing hundreds of Paulsboro workers and contributing to a steady rate of out-migration. In addition to the poor economic conditions in Paulsboro, the continuous repair of the public water system, much of which was built in the ’s, was becoming unfeasible, so the Borough worked with RD’s Water and Waste Disposal program to obtain financing for the water system improvements. “We’ve done over $20 billion in investments under the Recovery Act, with over $134 million of that right here in New Jersey,” said Deputy Under Secretary Cook.  “This is an investment that will yield dividends many years into the future for the residents of Paulsboro.” A Recovery Act loan-grant combination of $4.3 million will allow for the construction of two new water supply wells and a new water treatment plant.  These upgrades will remove aluminum, iron, manganese, benzene, and radium contaminants from the raw water, so Paulsboro residents will enjoy clean drinking water. In addition, these water system upgrades will facilitate greater economic development along the Port of Paulsboro.  New Jersey’s Governor recently traveled to the Port of Paulsboro to announce an off-shore wind energy generation initiative, which involves the employment of Paulsboro residents in receiving and assembling wind turbines at the Port.  This renewable energy initiative has the potential to create thousands of permanent jobs in the area. This is an exciting time for the borough of Paulsboro, and I am thrilled Rural Development, through Recovery Act funding, can contribute to this great project.  The jobs to be created in the construction of the new water system will serve to invigorate the Paulsboro economy now, but the upgraded system will allow for continued economic growth into the future.

"Michigan Rural Development Public Information Officer in  Rural  Jun 04,   Last week, USDA Rural Development in Michigan got an early start on Homeownership Month by promoting a pilot refinancing program, announced in February by Secretary Tom Vilsack, to help residents with current USDA home loans reduce their payments. Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development Doug O’Brien and USDA Rural Development State Director for Michigan James Turner made the announcement at the Portage office of AmeriFirst Home Mortgage, a leading partner with USDA’s Guaranteed Home Loan program. AmeriFirst agreed to participate in the pilot refinance initiative and eight of the first 26 loans were with their customers. “Since the creation of the USDA Guaranteed Home Loan program, USDA has helped more than 54,000 rural Michigan residents purchase houses,” O’Brien said.  “This pilot refinancing initiative helps people keep their homes and avoid financial hardship. I encourage any USDA homeowner who is eligible to explore this simplified refinancing program.” Existing Rural Development borrowers eligible for the pilot refinance program are not to obtain new appraisals, property inspections or credit .  The new interest rate for the refinance must be a fixed rate at least 1 percentage point below the current interest rate. The term cannot exceed 30 years.  No cash-out is permitted to the borrower. Complete details concerning eligibility are available at any USDA Rural Development office. Homeowners who meet these criteria may refinance their Rural Development guaranteed loans regardless of the loan-to-value ratio for the property. This enables borrowers who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth to get lower interest rates and reduce their monthly mortgage payments. “The pilot program can help stabilize neighborhoods and prevent the disruption and loss caused by home foreclosures,” Turner said.  “The goal is to help residents keep their homes and meet their obligations by giving them some financial breathing room.” After the Portage event, Deputy Under Secretary O’Brien went to Edwardsburg, on the Indiana state line, where he toured a glycerine-refining facility owned by CRB Real Estate LLC.

"Vermont/New Hampshire USDA Rural Development state director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 12,  USDA Rural Development’s Business and Loan Guarantee Program supported new construction for an expanded Brattleboro Food Coop in Brattleboro, Vermont. The original plan for two stories was expanded to four thanks to an innovative partnership with the Windsor Housing Trust to develop mixed-income apartments. “Smart Growth” is a term we hear more and more often.  It is the idea that as communities plan for the future, they consider the highest and best use of every resource – land, infrastructure, organizations and people.    From housing to transportation to energy to food; community developers and planners are asking how Smart Growth principles can be applied to ensure a sustainable and dynamic future for their communities and their residents. How is USDA involved in these efforts? Consider Brattleboro, Vermont.  With a population of 12,000, Brattleboro sits on the state’s southeastern border, and is a vibrant mix of industry, art and education.    Brattleboro’s downtown district was one of the first communities to take advantage of Vermont’s Downtown Program giving it access to state tax credits and shining a spotlight on its rich history. Its vibrant downtown is an inviting mix of shops, restaurants, offices and an art deco theatre and hotel.    Anchoring one end of the downtown is the Brattleboro Food Coop. Founded in , the Brattleboro Food Coop started as a local buying club.  It eventually grew into a popular retail destination featuring a wide range of products from nearby farms in Vermont, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.  By , the Brattleboro Coop was outgrowing its space.  It considered moving to a new location outside of downtown.  The Board of the Coop, however, decided that its mission was much more compatible with a Smart Growth solution to its expansion needs.    In the meantime, the Windham and Windsor Housing Trust (WWHT) and Housing Vermont, were looking for a solution to Brattleboro’s need for more mixed income housing that was easily accessible to downtown’s services and amenities. With support from a loan guarantee from USDA’s Business & Industry Loan Guarantee Program, the Brattleboro Coop remained downtown in a new, highly energy efficient building with expanded retail space.  The new Coop space was originally envisioned as a two story building.   Through innovative partnerships, an additional two stories on the new building were sold to WWHT and Housing Vermont.   Though the Coop and the housing complex have separate ownership, they have similar commitment to the sustainable future of Brattleboro. The Brattleboro Coop is featured in the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass for its dedication to local food and local communities. It recently received a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its commitment to Smart Growth principles.  The results are stunning.  The new Brattleboro Coop Building opened in June, . It now boasts over 14,000 square feet of retail space, supporting up to 100 jobs.  Over 60 percent of the products come from nearby farms.  The building also hosts a commissary kitchen and classrooms for cooking classes.   24 beautiful, energy efficient, mixed income apartments in the heart of downtown Brattleboro occupy two stories above the Coop. Recently, the Brattleboro Coop won a National Award for Smart Growth Achievement as awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These awards, which began in , recognize exceptional approaches to development that respect the environment, foster economic vitality, enhance quality of life, and provide new opportunities for disadvantaged communities. “The new Cooperative Building incorporates money-saving and innovative environmental features while fitting with the character of a traditional walkable New England town” noted the EPA. “Community members were the true champions of this project, insisting on a downtown location for their co-op that integrates both the grocery store and mixed-income housing”. The Brattleboro Coop is profiled in the Know Your Farmer Know Your Food Compass as an example of how local food systems can anchor community development and planning.  You can find other examples of how the Federal Government is supporting local food’s role in communities across the country on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass Map.

"Closing the Gap on Food Safety   From small, family farms to large food production companies, food safety is a top priority for the folks who feed our nation and put food on tables around the globe. Participating in programs like USDA’s Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), is one way that farmers and producers of all sizes can demonstrate to buyers that they are adhering to industry food safety standards.  By making this program more accessible to businesses of all sizes, USDA is creating opportunities for our nation’s small and mid-sized farmers.  Last week I traveled to Atlanta, Ga., for the Produce Marketing Association (PMA) Fresh Summit to discuss the expansion of our GroupGAP Program this coming spring. The program is an expansion of our Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) Audit Program, which provides third-party certification services to verify that operations are following industry-recognized food safety practices as well as recommendations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The pilot was supported by funding and technical expertise from the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and the Wallace Center at Winrock International.

"Know Where Your Food Comes From with USDA Foods  Do you know where your food comes from?  If you can pinpoint where your food was grown and produced, you can make more informed decisions to maximize quality, freshness, and nutritional value.

"Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 13,  Lori Cook, aka TV-personality “Maranda,” interviewed me about the importance of the Summer Food Service Program.  Hunger doesn’t take a summer vacation, and the State of Michigan is making sure that nutrition assistance programs don’t either. I recently traveled to the west side of the state to see some of the inspiring work our partners are doing to make sure that no one in their community has to face hunger. I first visited Fulton Street Farmers Market in Grand Rapids, where State and community partners are implementing new initiatives to improve the health of low-income Americans, such as fruit and vegetable incentive programs and nutrition education. A Michigan Department of Community Health employee even demonstrated a new pilot program that uses iPods and iPhones to accept SNAP and WIC benefits—very impressive! This means low-income individuals can more easily access fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets, and local farmers can increase their consumer base. I also got a chance to share exciting news about USDA’s new wireless technology grants for farmers markets that currently do not accept EBT. These grants increase access to fresh, healthy food while supporting family farmers and the local economy. Afterwards I headed to Kalamazoo, where community partner Loaves & Fishes hosted an energizing roundtable. Faith-based and community organizations from around the state joined me in a thoughtful discussion of the successes and challenges in operating the 15 USDA Food and Nutrition Service programs. I always learn something new by listening to those who work directly with the people who use our programs. The Grand Rapids school district feeds so many children that it needs semi-trucks to transport all of its meals! This year, I was happy to see they designed the outside of the trucks to show just how important school and summer meals are to so many children.  Later that afternoon, the Grand Rapids Press held an editorial board/community forum. This unique set-up gave me an opportunity to live Web chat with MLive readers about USDA nutrition assistance programs. We talked about everything from Summer EBT programs that allow families to feed children during the summer to the healthy changes USDA is making to school meals. The next day the Feeding America West Michigan Food Bank gave me a tour of their facilities. This food bank pioneered the concept of mobile food pantries. By modifying a beverage truck, the food bank was able to take fresh produce out into the community. Ken Estelle told me the food bank receives about 15% of its food from USDA Foods. Finally, I was fortunate enough to attend a kickoff of West Michigan’s Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). During the school year, more than 21 million children receive free and reduced-price lunch through the National School Lunch Program. And yet, when school lets out, only 3 million children receive a meal through a summer program. USDA’s SFSP is designed to address that gap, and WOOD-TV personality “Maranda” makes sure that happens every summer in western Michigan. Thousands of children came out to enjoy lunch and lots of physical activities. I’m a big supporter of the First Lady’s Let’s Move! initiative and it was great to see so many children playing outside and being active. What a fun event and a great way to end my visit to a state that is working so hard to improve the health and lives of its people!

After weeks of training and months of anticipation, I was finally on the ground – drip torch in hand – ready to apply fire to restore the mixed pine-hardwood forests at the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains on the Pisgah National Forest. Joining the U.S Forest Service only two months earlier, my knowledge of fire’s effect on plant and wildlife communities was limited. But as the coordinator for the Grandfather Restoration Project, part of the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration program, I had to quickly come up to speed with the on-the-ground reality of prescribed fire use. As I lit my drip torch that early March morning, igniting the thick leaf litter and dense shrubs that had accumulated during years of fire suppression, I couldn’t help but wonder – What happens to the wildlife after the fire? Utilizing fire is unnerving to those not familiar with fire as a restoration tool. The reality is much different; just as certain plants need fire to succeed, the animals that depend on those species benefit from fire as well. With the evolving use of prescribed fire as a restoration tool, it is critical to study the effects of fire on the communities we seek to restore. Traditional fire studies often focus on vegetation. The participants in the Grandfather Restoration Project decided to take it one step further and directly study wildlife use in sites treated with prescribed fire compared with untreated sites. Working collaboratively, wildlife specialists from Pisgah National Forest, the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission, and The Nature Conservancy designed a cutting-edge study using wildlife cameras. Re-entering the prescribed burn unit just four months after the fire, wildlife cameras in tow, I could see the changes in vegetation. Arising from the blackened ground a lush herbaceous layer had appeared, carpeting the forest with blueberries and grasses. Using 50 camera points over a six-week period in July and August, we studied the wildlife species that use our forests, and what habitats they prefer. Almost immediately, our cameras captured images of white-tailed deer, black bear, turkey and other wildlife attracted to the abundant grasses and forbs. Not only was I encouraged from the positive wildlife response to our burn, but our indicated a higher usage of the burned unit by wildlife when compared to the unburned unit; valuable information for land managers in determining population estimates and predator-prey ratios. I often think back to that first prescribed burn. I now understand what wildlife have known all along; that not only are wildlife capable of surviving fire, they reap the rewards of new growth, cover, and food stemming from fire and prescribed burning. For me, seeing these benefits firsthand is one of the most rewarding parts of my job with the U.S. Forest Service. Wild turkeys often nest in recently burned areas, taking full advantage of newly established sources of food and cover.

Nearly 200 of those acres were in Heir Property status and are currently in the process of getting a cleared title. (Photo courtesy of Randall Hildreth)  Focus on land tenure and transition issues has grown considerably in recent years, especially its impact on new and beginning farmers. ""New and beginning farmers are the future of American agriculture,"" said Deputy Secretary Harden.  ""The average age of an American farmer is 58 and increasing, so we must help new farmers get started if America is going to continue feeding the world and maintain a strong agriculture economy.""  As the age of the principal farm operator continues to increase, the focus on this issue intensifies. Land tenure, succession and estate planning, and access to land for new and beginning farmers will be among the topics discussed in a session at USDA’s Agricultural Outlook Forum this month. Succession was also one of the key focal points for the Tenure, Ownership, and Transition of Agricultural Land (TOTAL) survey, the results of which provided updated on these issues.  The TOTAL survey showed that U.S. farmland owners expect to transfer 91.5 million acres to new ownership over the next five years.  This represents 10 percent of all farmland across the nation. In addition to providing the number of acres expected to transition, TOTAL also provided on how the owners expect to transition this land and much more. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducted this survey jointly with USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS).  At the upcoming Agriculture Outlook Forum, Mary Bohman, ERS Administrator, will moderate a panel and lead a discussion on “Land Tenure & Transition.”  Joining her on the panel will be Neil Hamilton, Professor of Law and Director of the Agricultural Law Center at Drake University, Julia Freedgood, Assistant VP for Programs at the American Farmland Trust, Greg Ibach, Director, Nebraska Department of Agriculture, Dr. Damona Doye, Regents Professor and Rainbolt Chair of Agricultural Finance at Oklahoma State University, and Randall Hildreth a farm operator in Alabama and member of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives.

"Volunteer/Intern, U.S. Forest Service National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Aug 14,   Angeliz Vangas and Hanniah Rodriguez made a big impact serving as interns on the National Forests in North Carolina and are now heading back to school and continuing on their road to success. As part of the Student Career Experience Program (SCEP), this summer Vangas and Rodriguez interned in the U.S. Forest Service’s engineering department in Asheville, N.C. SCEP provides work experience that is directly related to the student's academic program or career aspirations and gives students exposure to public service while enhancing their educational goals. The civil engineering majors are rising seniors at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez and have a passion for engineering. Both are members of the student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, where they serve as treasurer and secretary, respectively. The students were introduced to the Forest Service last year when they interned at the agency’s Southern Region headquarters in Atlanta, Ga. There, they were given a crash course on how engineering worked within the agency and assisted with inspections within the national forests. The energetic duo took what they learned in Atlanta and put it into practice to deliver results in Asheville, N.C. this summer. They were instrumental in developing an application for a $7 million grant to repair many of the damaged roads in the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie and Croatan National Forests in North Carolina. They transferred sketches made of the damaged roads to an Auto-CAD, which is used to produce more technical computerized models of the damaged areas. These models are crucial in formulating proposals needed to obtain the grant and to determine how best to repair the roads. Vangas and Rodriguez said interning with the Forest Service has been an engaging and insightful experience. They enjoyed working in Atlanta last year and the city life that comes with it. They said it has been particularly interesting working in Asheville, N.C. because of its close proximity to the national forests. This proximity provided them with more field work experience and to see the environment that they are affecting. “It has been really easy to adjust here because everyone has been so welcoming,” Rodriguez said. Rodriguez chose to intern with the Forest Service because of the diversity of opportunities.  “Working with the Forest Service provides two work scenarios – both field and office work,” she explained. Vangas echoed these sentiments. “It’s nice using our technical skills to help improve the forests,” she said. Although they are unsure about what they want to do after graduation, both say they would like to continue working for the Forest Service in civil engineering. They enjoyed learning from and meeting a lot of new people who have been influential on paving their road to becoming civil engineers and perhaps future Forest Service employees.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Public Affairs Specialist in  USDA Results  Trade  Oct 18,  Dutch Chef Eric Troost prepares an upscale dish using U.S. beef during a cooking demonstration for about 130 Belgian chefs Sept. 24. The demo was part of the first U.S. beef tasting event held in Belgium, which was hosted by the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, and the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). The tasting was part of ongoing efforts to help expand U.S. beef exports to the European Union (EU). (Photo courtesy FAS The Hague)  The European Union (EU) is a relatively new market for U.S. beef exports. It wasn’t until August when the United States began exporting high-quality beef (marbled with a high fat content) to the EU under a negotiated tariff rate quota for non-hormone treated beef. Today, about 25 percent of U.S. beef exports to the EU are high-quality cuts such as tenderloin, strip loin and rib eye mostly used by upscale restaurants. The remaining beef exports include medium and lower quality cuts such as flank steak, chuck eye roll, briskets and shoulder clods. Finer restaurants in the EU traditionally do not integrate these cuts into their menus To help introduce these secondary cuts and expand U.S. beef exports to the EU, the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) office in The Hague, Netherlands, partnered with the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) and a Belgium-based meat importer and distributor to host the first U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium Sept. 24. USMEF’s international marketing efforts on behalf of U.S. beef, pork, lamb and veal are funded by the FAS Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development programs to support activities such as this event. During the U.S. beef tasting event, approximately 130 Belgian chefs learned about the preparation of these less familiar beef cuts. Local Dutch Chef Eric Troost presented various cooking demonstrations including slowly cooked top sirloin with barbecue sauce, tartar of shoulder clod with artichoke and shallots and top blade with beets, coriander and sesame vinaigrette. The chefs were excited to learn cooking techniques for the secondary beef cuts, which are nearly 40 percent cheaper than primary beef cuts, said Mary Ellen Smith, agricultural attaché at the FAS office in The Hague. “Typically, secondary cuts from European beef cannot be used for finer dishes, so the Belgian chefs were intrigued by the various cooking methods that take advantage of the unique marbling in U.S. beef,” she said. “Events like these help introduce new U.S. products not only to the chefs that prepare them but to the thousands of European consumers that they serve.” The U.S. beef tasting event is just one example of how FAS’s market development programs have a long history of helping farmers, ranchers, and businesses of all sizes build and maintain commercial markets for U.S. food and agricultural products around the world. It also helps support President Obama’s National Export Initiative, which aims to double U.S. exports by the end of . Click here to view a video recap of the U.S. beef tasting event in Belgium.

"USDA Office of Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Nov 20,  General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin speaks at a press conference announcing the completion of the first-of-its kind purchase of verified carbon credits generated on working ranch lands by Chevrolet, at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Nov. 17, . (L to R Senator Debbie Stabenow (MI), General Motors Global Public Policy Executive Director Greg Martin, Ducks Unlimited Paul Schmidt, The Climate Trust Executive Director Sean Penrith, and USDA Natural Resources and Environment (NRE) Under Secretary Robert Bonnie). USDA photo by Tom Witham. Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales. This is how the credit system works: Landowners voluntarily place lands under a perpetual easement but retain rights to work the land, such as raising livestock and growing hay. The carbon storage benefits of this avoided conversion of grasslands are quantified, verified, and formally registered resulting in carbon credits. The carbon credits are made available to entities interested in purchasing carbon offsets. Chevrolet's purchase was undertaken voluntarily as part of its commitment to reduce eight million tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted. This is comparable to the annual carbon reduction benefit of a mature forest the size of Yellowstone National Park. USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) awarded $161,000 through a Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) to Ducks Unlimited in to develop the necessary methodology to quantify the carbon stored in the soil by avoiding grassland conversions, resulting in the generation of carbon credits. Besides the landowners, USDA, and Ducks Unlimited, other key partners that helped make this project a success include The Climate Trust, American Carbon Registry, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund and Terra Global Capital. Public-private partnerships to enhance U.S. carbon sinks such as forests, grasslands, wetlands and coastal areas, are a key part of the Obama Administration’s recently released Climate and Natural Resources Priority Agenda.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Missouri in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Aug 12,  Curtis Millsap works in the Chinese High Tunnel on his southwestern Missouri farm. NRCS photo. You can get just about anything you want at Millsap Farms, including an education about market farming. Curtis Millsap estimates that he, his family and a crew of interns feed about 200 families on 2.5 acres of his 20-acre farm near Springfield, Mo. While another seven acres of the farm sometimes includes sheep, poultry and cattle, it’s the vegetable operation that supports Millsap, his wife Sarah and their nine young children. Millsap uses two greenhouses and three seasonal high tunnels to grow produce year-round. High tunnels are plastic-covered structures that enable farmers to lengthen the growing season by using the sun’s heat to regulate temperature inside. Millsap sells through the Farmers Market of the Ozarks and to 75-100 community supported agriculture, or CSA, customers. In a CSA, people buy shares of the farm, and in return they receive a portion of the harvest when in season. One of Millsap’s high tunnels is a Chinese high tunnel, which he built with funding through a Conservation Innovation Grant from the USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, Millsap received financial assistance from NRCS to install a conventional seasonal high tunnel through NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Missouri is home to hundreds of seasonal high tunnels, including nearly 500 funded by NRCS, but Millsap’s Chinese high tunnel is the only one in Missouri, and one of only a few in the United States. Millsap received $20,000 from a $50,000 Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) awarded to the Watershed Committee of the Ozarks to build the Chinese high tunnel, pay for energy renovations in other greenhouses and to establish a grazing system. This grant program helps groups demonstrate innovative approaches to improve soil quality, air quality, and water quality, conserve energy, and enhance wildlife habitat in balance with productive agricultural systems. The committee wanted to demonstrate the benefits of the Chinese high tunnel, which differs from other seasonal high tunnels in that one of the long sides of the 23-by-70-foot structure and both short ends are heavily insulated with concrete and soil. “One of the things the CIG did was improve our efficiency in the high tunnel,” Millsap said. “It is warmer in the morning and warmer in the evening (in the Chinese high tunnel) than in the other greenhouses. But what’s interesting is that midday, it is cooler in there than in the other greenhouses. This thing never spikes. It has a smooth curve, which is better for plants.” Millsap said the different design is popular in China, where energy is expensive and labor is cheap. “I was looking into the future and thinking that energy is not going to get cheaper, so it made sense,” Millsap said. “And this is a teaching farm, so I have the workers.” Millsap’s workers include seven apprentices who are compensated with room, board, a farming education and a stipend. “These are people who seriously want to experience this and see if they want to be farmers,” Millsap said. “We’ve been doing this for seven years. I’ve had 20 apprentices, and seven are still actively involved in agriculture.” The farm also serves as a site for farm tours and other community events, all intended to further the buy-local movement. High tunnels are a cornerstone of USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative, which coordinates USDA’s work on local and regional food systems.  Since , through NRCS, USDA has provided assistance to help producers construct over 13,000 high tunnels on farms around the country. “We have this great promotion in ‘buy local,’ but that will go away if we can’t meet demand,” Millsap said. “We try to get as many people out to the farm as we can, show them what farming is about, maybe get their hands dirty.” Not raised on a farm, Millsap said he learned to farm by attending conferences, by reading and by visiting with lots of other farmers. He said it was something he found himself called to do. “It’s not something I was looking to do, but sometimes when you are called, you better listen,” he said.

"Northwest Regional Conservationist, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Aug 11,  The Mid-Snake River, near Twin Falls. Water Quality Trading is one way the States of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are working to protect their rivers. Photo courtesy of the Idaho DEQ Twin Falls Regional Office, used with permission. The Pacific Northwest is known for its picturesque lakes, cascading streams and dramatic coastlines. The many rivers of the Pacific Northwest—the Yakima, the Snake, Snohomish, Willamette, Klamath, Boise, and others—are part of the cultural, economic and environmental foundation of the region. These waters are meaningful for local Native American Tribes, agricultural production, industries who rely on water resources, and local communities and tourists from around the world that enjoy fishing and other forms of recreation along Northwestern rivers and streams. It’s no surprise that the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho are interested in protecting their rivers to preserve these values, and the wildlife and ecosystems they’re a part of. More surprising, however, is the innovative way the states are collaborating to do it. Water quality trading allows point sources that directly discharge to water, like wastewater treatment plants, to invest in “green” infrastructure by restoring the watershed’s natural capacity to filter water. For example, instead of installing expensive technology to reduce phosphorous discharges, the treatment plant could pay farmers upstream to plant trees along their fields to reduce the same amount (or more) of phosphorous from reaching the rivers. Water quality trading may create cost savings for regulated sources, supports conservation on working agricultural lands, and generate environmental solutions that have benefits beyond just water quality—including carbon sequestration and wildlife habitat. In , the Willamette Partnership was awarded a $1.5 million Conservation Innovation Grant (CIG) from USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to help facilitate a conversation with Washington, Oregon, and Idaho to develop multi-state recommendations on water quality trading. The CIG allowed the Willamette Partnership and The Freshwater Trust to convene Washington, Oregon and Idaho state department of environment staff and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 10 to identify common principles and practices to shape consistent approaches to trading in the region, with a focus on how trading could help regulated sources of pollutant discharges meet their discharge limits while providing additional environmental benefits. The effort resulted in a set of joint recommendations for each state to consider as they develop and further their water quality trading programs, with a goal of keeping those programs consistent with the Clean Water Act and state and local water quality laws. The recommendations address the importance of sound science, avoiding local water quality problems, providing evidence that resulting environmental benefits are real, and ensuring that these benefits are echoed in local communities. Today, the three states have committed to testing these principles and an associated set of recommendations through . Following this piloting phase, the states and EPA will discuss their experiences, and if necessary, refine their joint recommendations. The states, in consultation with partners, will decide how or whether to incorporate the joint recommendations into formal policy or guidance on trading. Bobby Cochran, Executive Director for Willamette Partnership noted, “This is a really exciting time for the Northwest. Washington, Oregon, and Idaho thought deeply about how the joint recommendations can help provide some clarity on trading, promote good stewardship, and support clean water for communities and fish.” The joint recommendations put forth by Washington, Oregon and Idaho can serve as an example for the rest of the country on how to establish well thought out trading programs that are built for success. Through CIG projects and other joint efforts, including the EPA – USDA Partnership Agreement to support water quality trading, we can do a better job of protecting water resources we rely on—while benefitting local communities, producers, and the environment.

"U.S. Forest Service, North Carolina in  Forestry  Mar 28,  For six years, U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement Office Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros patrolled the Grandfather Ranger District on the Pisgah National Forest. They were killed during a search for a homicide suspect. (U.S. Forest Service) Law-enforcement peers, U.S. Forest Service employees, dignitaries and friends gathered at the McDowell County High School in Marion, N.C. last week to honor Forest Service law enforcement officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner, Maros. Among the memorial service attendees were 75 K-9 officers and their partners who paid tribute to both fallen officers. U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory were among the thousands who filled the school’s gymnasium. Crisp and Maros were shot and killed on March 12 pursuing a suspect who, just hours earlier, had allegedly killed his father and step-mother. As they had so many times before, Crisp and Maros were working to keep the Grandfather Ranger District, Pisgah National Forest, and surrounding area safe. “Jason was happy being with his family, and he was happy serving his community,” the Rev. Charles Dicks said. “He cared about the agency, and he cared about his coworkers.” These were common themes shared by speakers at the ceremony. They described the 38-year-old Crisp as a devoted husband, a loving father of two and a kind-hearted man who helped others. A Forest Service law enforcement officer for eight years, Crisp was a man of strong faith, whose spirituality served as the foundation for how he approached life. He and Maros performed their duties with honor, courage and dignity. One of Jason’s family members shared the following story prior to the ceremony. Honor Guard members begin to fold the U.S. Forest Service and North Carolina State flags during a memorial ceremony for Officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros. (Courtesy of Mario Rossilli) “The last time I saw Jason, he came to my house and spent a couple of hours with me; but he was upset at me,” the grieving family member said. “I had recently helped another family member with some house work, and Jason was upset that I didn’t call to ask for his help… That’s the type of person Jason was.” March 12 was Jason’s day off. When he received the call about a murder suspect who was on the loose, he didn’t hesitate to respond. Maros assisted in the call, and it was the last time the two would answer the call of duty. Despite the tragic outcome, the two officers are not separated. Jason was laid to rest on March 17 with Maros’ ashes placed in an urn in his arms. They will be missed by the people who knew and loved them in western North Carolina. Thousands packed into the McDowell County High School to pay tribute to Forest Service Law Enforcement Officer Jason Crisp and his K-9 partner Maros.

"USDA Rural Development Public Information Coordinator in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Dec 26,   USDA Rural Development New Mexico State Director Terry Brunner (center) presents a certificate of obligation to the Ten Southern Pueblo Council Governors and representatives during ceremonies to celebrate the successful application of funds creating the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. (USDA Photo) The air was crisp and cold as the wind blew across Sandia Pueblo in mid-December.  But, the atmosphere among the Ten Southern Pueblo Governor’s Council was warm and jovial. Why? Because, the Governors were celebrating the obligation of a USDA Rural Development funded study that creates the first ever Native American Food Hub in the nation. For hundreds of years the residents of the Pueblos in New Mexico have farmed the land to provide the food they ate.  Today, the Native farmers continue to grow corn, squash, beans and other produce for their own consumption.  But often they have abundance of food at the end of every growing season. This successful farming can be a problem because the farmers do not have a mechanism to deliver excess produce to market or those in need.  Food hubs offer a model to provide infrastructure support to farmers usually through a central location where food can be processed and distributed. The Ten Southern Pueblos Council contracted with the Acoma Business Enterprises to serve as the fiscal manager and apply for a Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) through USDA. The RBEG financial support is funding a study to determine how best to manage the distribution of food produced by native growers through a food hub concept.  Work has begun to identify farmers and their needs to market and deliver the food to a central distribution point.  Once the is collected a plan will be implemented in to make sure the food is provided to the residents of the ten Pueblos and to others needing fresh, healthy produce for their diet.  As well, the Pueblos hope that a successful food hub offers more sustainability to native farmers who wish to make a living through farming.

"Conference Explores Ways to Value Resources, Improve the Environment and Put a Check into Producers' Pockets  What is the monetary value of a supply of clean water?  Or the value of clean air or having places available to hike and fish? For decades we have taken these resources for granted, or at least we have not put a monetary value on their benefits. That’s changing.  Participants from 30 nations met this week at the ACES: A Community on Ecosystem Services; Linking Science, Practice and Decision Making conference to talk about just how we can value these benefits and include that in our decision-making and planning.  As the conference kicked off, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tidwell talked about the need to quantify the benefits of public lands, building consensus and support for a multi-generational outlook, moving away from short term objectives and toward “sustaining the health and diversity of our forests and grasslands.” Participants included a number of other federal officials, including Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, USDA Undersecretary Robert Bonnie, and Jay Jensen of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ).

We were guided and educated, at least as much as can be done in just one morning’s time, by Arvol Looking Horse and Tim Mentz Sr. Many years ago, when he was only 12, Looking Horse had been given the enormous responsibility of being the 19th generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe. He is a spiritual leader for the Lakota Dakota Na-kota Oyate, the great Sioux Nation. Mentz is a cultural resource expert with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He was their first Tribal historic preservation officer and continues to be an amazing source of information about cultural sites for his Tribe. We learned from tribal elders and Forest Service staff that these stone formations had been misinterpreted several years ago by an archaeologist as teepee rings, or circles of rocks left after having served their purpose of holding down the edges of teepees. The archaeologist had deemed these features as “insignificant” in terms of historical value. The tribal elders explained that these were no teepee rings.  Rather, the stone features were ceremonial shapes, purposefully placed and each with its own sacred reason. Having worked as an archaeologist for some 20 years myself, including having mapped and excavated teepee rings in Montana and Wyoming, I was also aware that these forms were far from the evenly rounded rings I’d seen many times before. They were shapes, but shapes of what? The elders explained how the features are organized, how they relate to the surrounding landscape, the directions, other sites both near and far, and a bit about what each feature’s functions would have been. They pointed out the meaning behind the features and talked about how these places have current and ongoing power. Mentz and his crew mapped the entire site during our visit, and related the physical shapes and functions to hundreds of other sites they had recorded. They talked about how many of these types of sites had already been destroyed by development, and how many are endangered. They showed us the life and significance in the rocks, reinforcing the great need to further protect places like this. While many of the sites being destroyed are on private land, the message was urgent and relates directly to our task of doing a better job within the agency to protect the places held sacred by American Indians and Alaska Natives on national forests and grasslands. Meeting and working with elders like Looking Horse and Mentz and having them share this kind of information, we are better prepared to bring to this work a good mind and a good heart, and better able to affect the shape of things to come.

"Producers get a New Revenue Source, Waterfowl Habitat is Preserved and Industry Benefits from Conservation Effort  Earlier this week, USDA highlighted the creation of a market for carbon credits generated on working grasslands. Landowners benefit because they receive compensation for the carbon credits generated on their lands. They get a new source of revenue, while thriving grasslands provide nesting habitat for wildlife, are more resilient to extreme weather, and help mitigate the impact of climate change. Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, recently purchased almost 40,000 carbon dioxide reduction tons generated on working ranch grasslands in the Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. It was the first purchase of its type.  Robert Bonnie, USDA's under secretary for Natural Resources and Environment, announced the purchase and USDA's involvement in the project at an event at USDA headquarters. He was joined by Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Greg Martin, executive director for global public policy, General Motors; Sean Penrith, executive director of The Climate Trust and Paul Schmidt, chief conservation officer of Ducks Unlimited. The under secretary thanked Senator Stabenow, Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, for her staunch support for the program, which she said is delivering “real world measurable results.” Bonnie said he hopes this purchase will set a pattern for future carbon credit sales.

"Public Affairs Officer, National Forests in North Carolina in  Forestry  Jun 06,   National Fishing and Boating Week, a part of the June celebration of Great Outdoors Month, will be celebrated again this year June 2 - 10. It’s a time when fishing fanatics and amateur anglers will visit national forests and grasslands across the country to try their hands at landing the big one. On the National Forests in North Carolina, anglers with physical disabilities who visit the Nantahala, Pisgah, Uwharrie, and Croatan National Forests will have a number of accessible piers to choose from. Some of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations. “For more than 20 years, the National Forests in North Carolina and North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission have been committed to providing anglers of all abilities with the opportunity to go fishing on public lands,” said Sheryl Bryan, the forests’ fisheries and wildlife biologist. Some of these piers provide access to premier trout fishing destinations. “During this time, forest and district biologists, engineers, landscape architects and recreation proponents have worked together to create a comprehensive network of accessible fishing opportunities across a diversity or resources,” added Delce Dyer, the forests’ developed recreation program manager. Today, there are close to 20 barrier-free fishing piers in the four national forests. Through careful planning, design and construction -- in partnership with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission -- accessible fishing facilities have been constructed from the mountains to the sea. The facilities provide fishing opportunities in warm-water reservoirs and small ponds, as well as cold-water streams and rivers. “Designs of fishing piers that extend over waterways have been refined over the years and have been adopted for use by the Wildlife Resources Commission throughout the state,” said Lynn Hicks, engineer and heritage and recreation staff officer. ”Site-specific designs have provided accessible parking and routes to these water-based sites, and most of the fishing piers include areas for both seated and standing fishing.” Recent piers include a metal mesh water-viewing component into a portion of the pier’s flooring. Accessible facilities on majestic Cherokee Lake in Nantahala National Forest include picnic tables and a pavilion, all connected along an accessible route. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo In addition to tourists, a number of local residents regularly use the accessible piers. In many communities, the piers have become centers for frequent outdoor recreation. For example, Boone Fork Pond pier, near the communities of Lenoir and Hudson, is commonly used as an outdoor destination for the mentally and physically challenged. Chapters of Wounded Warriors have assisted with projects, particularly on the Croatan National Forest. Other partners who have provided funding or assistance in constructing these facilities include Trout Unlimited, the Muskie Club, and Bass Anglers Sportsmen Society. The two piers near Robbinsville -- one on a small pond, the other on Santeetlah Lake -- provide community fishing opportunities. Many of these accessible fishing facilities are used during National Fishing Week activities, including sites for Special Needs Fishing Days. Great Outdoors Month is a time for all Americans to get outside and take part in a number of national events that encourage people to hike, fish, boat and/or camp at locations all across the country.  June 9 is also a fee free day for public lands including national forests.  So join friends and family and take time to celebrate our national heritage and enjoy the wonders of our national landscape.

"Program Analyst, USDA Office of Environmental Markets, Office of the Chief Economist in  Conservation  Dec 16,  Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack speaking at a press conference in Fairfax, VA. USDA photo by David Kosling. USDA has a long history of helping farmers, ranchers and forest landowners maintain their bottom line while improving soil health and reducing runoff into streams and rivers.  For nearly 80 years, USDA has offered funding and technical assistance for farmers to implement conservation practices through the conservation title of the Farm Bill. In recent years, however, USDA has also supported new, innovative approaches to voluntary, private lands conservation. An announcement today by USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, and Administrator Gina McCarthy of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in northern Virginia highlights an innovative approach called water quality trading. Farmers like John Harrison of Appomattox County are taking advantage of private investments to implement conservation practices on their land. These practices help reduce erosion and nutrient runoff into local bodies of water, generating nutrient credits that can then be sold to regulated entities looking to offset nutrient losses for compliance purposes. In this case, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) purchased phosphorous credits to offset water quality impacts from road construction. The offset credits have permitted the completion of more than 40 small road construction projects that improve traffic safety and flow by adding turn lanes, clover leafs, and small connectors, and repairing approaches to aging bridges. Compared to traditional engineered practices, the offset credits provide greater water quality benefits for up to half of the costs of installation and long-term maintenance. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (left) participates in a press conference with Commonwealth of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe.

Mr. Harrison appears in a USDA video explaining the project and the benefits realized on his farm. The project was the result of collaboration between the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, with support from USDA, the Federal Highway Administration and EPA.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Colorado in  Conservation  Mar 31,  The Southwestern willow flycatcher is an endangered bird that lives in the riparian areas of the Southwest. Photo courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The distinctive “fitz-bew” of the Southwestern willow flycatchers is music to the ears of the partners of Wetland Dynamics, LLC, and USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) recently improved the ability to hear them. Wetland Dynamics received a $60,000 Conservation Innovation Grant from NRCS in to develop innovative technology for monitoring the endangered flycatcher and two other imperiled species in Colorado’s San Luis Valley. “What we’re doing is innovative,” said Jenny Nehring, a biologist and partner at Wetland Dynamics. “The technology we’re using has been around for quite some time. But with the partnership now forged with NRCS, we are able to expand and improve our innovative techniques that build upon existing tools, which will in turn help to better understand certain wildlife species and improve protection of them.” Wetland Dynamics is expanding and exploring the use of a passive acoustic monitoring technology traditionally used to monitor bats and aquatic species like whales. The company is using this innovative technology to improve detection and monitoring of the Southwestern willow flycatcher, Western yellow-billed cuckoo and Northern leopard frog. The flycatcher, cuckoo and leopard frog are currently being monitored, but the widely used approach takes substantial labor and stresses birds. By recording the birds’ noises, Wetland Dynamics is able to study the endangered Southwestern willow flycatcher. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics. “It requires an observer in the field broadcasting the call of the bird to illicit a response from a bird on a territory,” Nehring said. “This method is intrusive and tricks the birds into thinking its territory is being threatened or infringed upon. Birds will, of course, react, but this reaction is stressful and energetically costly to already threatened and endangered species.” The new way of monitoring, funded by the grant from NRCS, eliminates the stress on the bird while expanding the information gathered. It relies on passive recording equipment. Because the devices can be stationed for prolonged periods of time, the consistency and quantity of information gathered will provide increased detection of species.  These more accurate detections will allow more focused and precise research on other things such as breeding success and habitat use. Between observer bias and influences like weather, which might prevent an observer from even reaching a monitoring site, the margin for error within the typical call play back monitoring method is high. A grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is enabling Wetland Dynamics to expand its monitoring efforts of the Southwestern willow flycatcher and other at-risk species of the riparian habitat. Photo courtesy of Wetland Dynamics. “Our recorders are stationary devices, can be set up for weeks and have limited disturbance. Recordings are then scanned to detect the vocalization of interest and to differentiate varying vocalizations like birds that are close or far away.” Although this technology is promising and is quite significant for future monitoring of species in areas, it cannot determine the number of species in a particular area. “But it can detect if the bird is present which will help researchers focus their on-the-ground field work to determine territory size, breeding effort and success as well as habitat condition,” she said. “More work is clearly needed and that’s why the CIG grant was so important.  It allows us to refine and test the technology and quantify perimeters for accuracy. We greatly value our partnership with NRCS and hope it grows so that other monitoring opportunities can be explored.” Conservation Innovation Grants aim to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies. This is one of NRCS’ many investments in the Southwest to help the flycatcher and other species. NRCS announced Monday its plans to broaden the conservation opportunities available to producers.

"The Sixth Tribal Nations Conference - Focusing on Youth  This week marked the sixth consecutive year tribal leaders have gathered here in Washington at the President’s invitation to meet with key members of the Obama Administration, but this time is different: more than three dozen youth ambassadors were in attendance to kick off “Generation Indigenous” (Gen-I) – a new initiative calling for programs focused on better preparing young American Indians and Alaska Natives for college and careers as well as developing leadership skills.  And it all started with the President’s visit last summer to the reservation of the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota.  The President and First Lady met with Native American youth and saw their promise, but also the challenges they face. In addition to issuing a White House Native Youth Report, outlining past government shortcomings, current challenges and a path forward for Native youth, we will look at ways to improve educational opportunities for Native youth, including improving schools, and reforming the Indian education system.

"Natural Resources Conservation Service, Earth Team Volunteer in  Conservation  Jun 17,  Honeybees leaving and returning to the hive after collecting pollen. Photo: Ashton Ebarb. “They’re in a happy mood today,” Jim Pratt, a local apiarist, said. At a comfortable 62 degrees, honeybees buzz with a clear objective: collect nectar and pollen, for honey and pollination. “Pollinators, like honeybees, support food crops,” Pratt said, explaining why for 20 years he’s raised honeybees. Pratt’s Farm annually produces about 120 pounds of honey per colony. He maintains 100 colonies, collecting honey from them each spring, summer and fall. During the winter, the bees eat stored honey until warmer weather arrives. Honeybees, like all pollinators, face challenges. Lack of habitat is the number one local threat Pratt sees to pollinators. USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to implement conservation practices on the ground that have numerous environmental benefits, including ones that provide habitat and food for pollinators. “Much of our local land is managed pastures,” Pratt said. Pastures provide benefits in various forms of agriculture, yet there are times between seasons when nothing is grown to attract pollinators across vast measures of land. “As a beekeeper, I seek out managed pastures over-seeded with clover. Placing colonies of honeybees in and around the pastures benefits not only the beekeeper with the potential of premium grade honey, but also benefits the landowner by sustaining the clover population as a result of the necessary pollination by the bees.” With NRCS’ Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), landowners can offset the cost of over-seeding clovers in their pastures and adjacent tracts specifically for pollinator species. “Pastures over-seeded with clover provide benefits in various forms of agriculture,” Pratt explained. “First, pollinators of all types are attracted to it. Second, clover replenishes nitrogen in the soil which better supports livestock forage.”  Since clovers are a cool-season legume, and usually die-back with the onset of mid-Summer, Pratt looks for tracts of land with natural habitat, such as wildlife refuges, conservation reserves and pollinator plantings adjacent to the pastures for nectar and pollen sources after the clover has died. Pollinators need nearby habitats which is vital to sustaining their populations. People need pollinators, too. No matter the pollinator, whether bee, bird, beetle, butterfly, bat or any other, all contribute to our food supply by pollination. “90 percent of fruits and vegetables are not self-pollinating,” said Janice Hutton, horticulturalist with The Sabine River Authority in Sabine Parish, Louisiana. Fruits and vegetables almost entirely depend upon pollinators. Every living person and thing that depends on fruits and vegetables depends on pollinators too. The good news: helping pollinators achieve their goal is as simple as growing certain plants. “I have to know what blooms, when it blooms and whether each colony has enough worker bees to collect nectar and pollen,” said Pratt. This week, USDA is celebrating National Pollinator Week by highlighting the many ways in which conservation benefits pollinators. Through the Farm Bill, landowners have an opportunity to receive financial assistance through conservation programs and practices, which includes planting cover crops to target these beneficial pollinators.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Mar 08,   The Forest Service has added an iPhone/iPad application called Invasive Plants in Southern Forests: Identification and Management to its strategy of reducing nonnative invasive plants in the South. The free app will allow more people to get involved in eradicating foreign plants, which, along with nonnative animals and pathogens, harm water supplies.  They also harm native plants, wildlife, livestock and property in both rural and urban areas at a cost of about $138 billion annually. Using Forest Service funding and research, the University of Georgia Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health created the software from the Southern Research Station publications A Field Guide for the Identification of Invasive Plants in Southern Forests and A Management Guide for Invasive Plants in Southern Forests. The U.S. Forest Service is a leading agency working to reduce the impact of the hundreds of invasive plants threatening public and private lands. The application was funded by a grant from the Forest Service Southern Research Station’s Insects, Diseases and Invasive Plants unit. The software provides photos and information that allow users to identify the 56 nonnative plants and plant groups currently invading 13 Southern states. “Ultimately we hope this app will give people a new tool to go out and identify invasive plants and map their occurrence,” said Southern Research Station Research Ecologist James Miller, who co-authored the application’s source guides. “Effective control relies on understanding of species and how they spread across the landscape. Those are important first steps in stopping and containing the invasions of harmful nonnative plants.” Like the publications it was developed from, the app divides nonnative invasive plants into trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, ferns and forbs, and provides identification keys, photos and management recommendations. The app also gives users simple, on-the-spot options for treating invasive plants. Future versions of the application will include the ability to directly report new sightings of select species into the Georgia Center’s Early Detection and Distribution Mapping System (EDDMapS), which provides a quick way to submit photos and report new sightings of invasive plants on the spot throughout the United States.

This native plant has been useful to humans since inhabiting the eastern regions of the U.S. and Canada.  Still today, locals harvest ramps for food, medicinal preparations, and to sell at markets and spring festivals. U.S. Forest Service scientist Joan Walker has been monitoring populations of ramps in the mountain coves of western North Carolina for 11 years. The results of her research show that although abundance can vary from year to year, about a quarter of the plots had decreasing ramps cover. “All of the plots that showed a decrease were where harvesting disturbance was high,” said Walker who is based out of the agency’s Southern Research Station. “Also, harvested plots as a group have reduced ramps populations compared to undisturbed ones.” These results suggest that it may be time to re-examine the current harvest policy and perhaps take corrective measures to ensure the species will be available for future generations of Americans. In the Southern Appalachians, many prime sites for harvesting ramps are within national forest boundaries. The National Forest System is responsible for maintaining biological diversity to sustain valuable ecosystem services such as clean air and water, healthy soil, abundant wood, recreational opportunities and other forest-based commodities that include herbs and edible plants. Ramps are among the first ephemeral greens to emerge during the spring months of March and April. With their electric green leaves, plump, white bulb and distinct odor, ramps are easy to distinguish from other early growers. After a hard winter in the mountains with food stores running low, this green “manna” would have literally been a life saver to both Native Americans and settlers living throughout the region in years past. Concerns about harvesting effects in the southern range (northern Georgia and Alabama and western North Carolina) prompted Walker’s monitoring study in two areas of the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. The goal of the project is to track the populations over time and to determine if trends are related to local harvesting, weather, or even changing climate. The monitoring study consists of 25 plots distributed between 3,500 feet to just over 5,000 feet in elevation.

"Southern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Feb 11,  Healthy seagrass meadows prevent erosion on coasts, store carbon, and provide marine animals with food and habitat. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency) Just off Florida’s 8,000 miles of coastline and tidal areas, in shallow sunlit waters, over two million acres of seagrass meadows waft in the ocean currents. Besides providing food and habitat for manatees, sea turtles, shellfish, and other animals, seagrasses protect coasts from erosion and store vast quantities of carbon dioxide. “Seagrasses grow off the coast of many other U.S. states, including North Carolina and Virginia, as well as around the world,” said U.S. Forest Service Southern Research Station scientist Zanethia Choice. “Globally, their economic value is nearly $4 trillion.” Although more closely related to lilies than to terrestrial grasses, like most of their distant grass kin, seagrasses require plenty of sunlight. Poor water quality reduces the amount of sunlight that reaches them, and seagrasses around the world are threatened by practices that affect water quality such as wastewater disposal and fertilizer runoff. Choice, a natural resource specialist at the research center’s Center for Bottomland Hardwoods Research, and her colleagues from the University of Florida recently studied light requirements for four common seagrass species along the Florida Gulf Coast. The study was published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin. “We found a direct relationship between the amount of light reaching the ocean floor and the amount and diversity of seagrasses growing there,” said Choice. In 90 percent of sites where 13 years of historic showed that adequate sunlight had been reaching the ocean floor, researchers found thriving seagrass meadows. However, areas with suitable light but no seagrass were most likely due to unsuitable substrate, temperature, and the amounts of dissolved salts and oxygen. Seagrasses are adapted to nutrient-poor waters. When nutrients – whether from fertilizer runoff, wastewater disposal, or other human activities – wash into the ocean, they float suspended in the ocean waters. Seagrasses cannot use these suspended nutrients very efficiently, but tiny algae called phytoplankton can. Phytoplankton thrive in nutrient-rich waters, and as they grow, they intercept light and shade the ocean floor. Seagrasses were notably absent from areas with high nutrient levels. Some seagrasses such as star grass could survive with as little as 8 percent of sunlight reaching the ocean floor, while other species 25 percent sunlight or more. “Light requirements for all the seagrasses we studied differed from previous findings at other locations,” said Choice. “The differences are probably due to morphological and physiological differences, and adaptation to light histories at specific locations.” Understanding the light requirements of different seagrass species is essential for coastal managers who want to maintain seagrass habitats, and managing for seagrass health also provides water quality targets that can benefit other marine life.

"Public Affairs Specialist, NRCS California in  Conservation  Jul 28,  A planning meeting with Freitas at the Redding Service Center.  Shasta County landowner Karen Freitas has worked with the staff of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) since , when she sought help recovering from a devastating wild fire that had burned much of her 160-acre tree farm the previous summer. Helping agricultural producers recover after a natural disaster is fairly routine work for NRCS, and the Redding office, where Freitas went for assistance, was no different. But what was unusual for these NRCS employees is that Freitas is deaf—presenting an unusual opportunity for client assistance. Freitas approached the Redding NRCS office initially for assistance rebuilding her operation, and District Conservationist Bob Bailey was able to help her put together a conservation plan and an application for cost-share funding through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Conservation work implemented under the first contract she signed with NRCS covered water control structures, brush management, critical area plantings, fuel breaks, tree and shrub establishment, forest site preparation, forest stand improvement and access road work. More recently, Freitas has been working with NRCS to develop a forest management plan on her property. District Conservationist Bob Bailey, Karen Freitas and Forester Jeff Webster working on a forest management plan with the assistance of a sign language interpreter.  Initially it seemed there might be some communication challenges in working with a hearing-impaired client, especially in some of the more technical aspects of the work. Freitas was the first deaf client NRCS California’s Redding office had ever helped. But the office contracted for professional sign language interpretative services, with excellent results. Since then, District Conservationist Bailey has used an interpreter several times to facilitate communications between Freitas and NRCS staff during planning meetings and implementation of projects in the field. “Using an interpreter has worked out great,” Bailey says. “I feel a sense of satisfaction that I was able to assist Mrs. Freitas with her forest management objectives. She is one of the hardest working clients I have, and she takes great satisfaction in the conservation projects she completes.” NRCS often works with clients to meet their communication needs, relying not only on American Sign Language interpreters, but also interpreters for non-hearing impaired landowners and land managers whose first language is not English. A sign language interpreter facilitates communication as Bob Bailey explains how soil erosion concerns on an access road might be addressed.  In addition, USDA has many department-wide provisions to ensure equal access to services for traditionally underserved groups such as women and black farmers, low-income farmers, and Tribes.

"Web Communications Intern in  USDA Results  Initiatives  Energy  Forestry  Sep 16,  Rick Huszagh and Crista Carrell, Down to Earth Energy, Georgia Cross posted from the White House Rural Champions of Change website: When Rick Huszagh and Crista Carrell purchased part of her family’s farm in , their focus was on farmland preservation as much as the creation of a successful business enterprise. Mountain Creek Farm started out selling Boer goats to purebred and commercial breeders and bermuda hay to neighboring horse farms. Goat kids were raised each spring to sell for breeding stock or meat.  The couple improved their farm marketing by participating in shows, performance tests, and field days.  The farm’s proximity to the University of Georgia facilitated their involvement in herd management studies related to the control of internal parasites. They took full advantage of resources offered by the Cooperative Extension Service and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and participated in the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). Rick and Crista’s interest in sustainability issues on the farm led them to research and implement small-scale biodiesel production for the tractors in . In , they intensified their renewable energy involvement when they were awarded a Renewable Energy for America Program (REAP) grant and USDA guaranteed loan. Along with like-minded partners, they established Down to Earth Energy, a commercial biodiesel production facility located adjacent to the farm. Concern with some of the inefficiencies in the biodiesel process led them to partner with the University of Georgia to develop a more effective catalyst.  The concept was further funded by an EPA Small Business Innovation Research Grant (SBIR) and a Venturelab grant. Crista was appointed a Walton County Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor in .

"Forest Service Research & Development in  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 03,  Kellie Carim, eDNA coordinator for the Genomics Center, collects and processes samples. (Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research profile. The U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. The Forest Service’s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station’s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.  collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management. Imagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. “eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

Ed Gold, Economic Developer for Adams County, was excited to share with Schneider his appreciation for the agency’s support for small businesses. On the last day of the tour, State Director Schneider recognized three entities for their strong leadership to increase economic development in rural communities with a Rural Business Opportunity Grant (RBOG) award.  They include Prairie West Development Foundation which received a grant to do a feasibility study on a proposed waste paper recycling and manufacturing center; and Roosevelt-Custer Regional Council which received a grant to address the impact that energy development is having on communities located in the Southwest Rural Economic Area Partnership (REAP) Zone. Also acknowledged was the city of New England, which received a grant to study a proposed glass recycling business to be located in the city. Seven cities and seven counties later, State Director Schneider and Rural Development staff were able to have meaningful discussions with a total of nearly 150 community leaders. Schneider’s visit helped highlight the positive growth made possible by USDA’s investments in rural communities.

"Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Resources, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 23,  A Forest Service employee, along with Woodsy Owl, pose with kids from the Girl Scott’s Daisy program during National Public Lands Day (Photo Credit: US Forest Service. Organizing the largest single-day volunteer effort in support of public lands in the country, National Public Lands Day, is no easy feat for the U.S. Forest Service. That’s 40 days of volunteer projects, BioBlitzes, fishing derbies, and educational events, all of which are registered with the National Environmental Education Foundation, the organization that started National Public Lands Day 23 years ago. Despite its origins as a volunteer event, National Public Lands Day is more than just service. This year’s tagline, Learn, Play, and Volunteer, emphasizes connecting people with the natural world through education and recreation as well as volunteerism, and partnerships forming around this year’s events embody NPLD’s expanding scope. The focus is Every Kid in a Park: a multi-agency effort to connect fourth-graders with their public lands through educational events and year-long free passes to national forests and parks. For Carmen Young, the Forest Service Public Lands Day lead, it’s a labor of love. ""It was so great seeing all the kids playing outside, learning about how water comes from forests and gets to our faucets, and contributing to water monitoring efforts in the D.C. area,” said Young. This year’s events are already in the works: from trail clearing to citizen science, there’s something for everyone.

"Hoosier National Forest in  May 13,  Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- A group of Hoosier National Forest employees plant chestnut trees in a timber sale area of the Hoosier to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service). Once a prominent phenomenon in southern Indiana, Bedford just experienced the first re-planting of American chestnut trees on the Hoosier National Forest in partnership with Purdue University and the U.S. Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “Historically, the American chestnut was once one of the most important trees in the eastern United States, occupying about 25 percent of the hardwood canopy in eastern forests,” said David Cleaves, climate change advisor for the Forest Service. The trees grew to be 80 feet tall or more, and were known as ‘the redwood of the East.’  By the s, the tree was nearly wiped out by an Asian fungus known as chestnut blight.  The restoration of American chestnut to eastern forests depends on the development of blight-resistant seedlings. The Forest Service, American Chestnut Foundation, and the University of Tennessee have been conducting research and tests to produce a blight-resistant American chestnut, with aspirations of restoring the species in its grandeur. Bedford, Ind., May 5, -- Forest Botanist Kirk Larson (foreground) plants an American chestnut tree on the Hoosier National Forest to return the American chestnut to its native range (Photo Credit: US Forest Service).  A traditional back-cross breeding method is being used to create blight-resistant American chestnut seedlings, which are 94 percent American chestnut and 6 percent Chinese chestnut --- and are blight resistant. The restoration effort began when the American Chestnut Restoration Project partners planted seedlings in three national forests in Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina in early . Scientists say the seedlings are surpassing expectations of survival and they are cautiously optimistic. A full decade will need to pass before massive replanting begins.  But the trees will be given every opportunity to do well. They were planted in a fenced enclosure to keep out deer and minimize damage from wildlife, and herbicides will be applied as needed to control undesirable competition. The fenced enclosure was built with help from fire crews from the Ottawa and White Mountain National Forests as well as Hoosier employees.  Ron Doyle planted the first blight-resistant American chestnut on the Hoosier National Forest, unofficially in honor of his father -- a long-time member of the American Chestnut Foundation. His father, now in a nursing home, was very pleased to hear the trees were returning to Indiana. Another Indiana site will be planted in .

"Manager, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  May 25,  Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer, then allow the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming. Cross posted from the FoodSafety.gov blog:  On May 24, USDA made some important changes in their recommended cooking temperatures for meats. Here’s what you need to know: Cooking Whole Cuts of Pork: USDA has lowered the recommended safe cooking temperature for whole cuts of pork from 160 ºF to 145 ºF with the addition of a three-minute rest time. Cook pork, roasts, and chops to 145 ºF as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source, with a three-minute rest time before carving or consuming. This will result in a product that is both safe and at its best quality—juicy and tender. Cooking Whole Cuts of Other Meats: For beef, veal, and lamb cuts, the safe temperature remains unchanged at 145 ºF, but the department has added a three-minute rest time as part of its cooking recommendations. What Cooking Temperatures Didn’t Change? Ground Meats: This change does not apply to ground meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork, which should be cooked to 160 ºF and do not require a rest time. Poultry: The safe cooking temperature for all poultry products, including ground chicken and turkey, stays the same at 165 ºF. What Is Rest Time?  “Rest time” is the amount of time the product remains at the final temperature, after it has been removed from a grill, oven or other heat source. During the three minutes after meat is removed the heat source, its temperature remains constant or continues to rise, which destroys harmful bacteria. Why Did the Recommendations Change? It’s just as safe to cook cuts of pork to 145 º F with a three-minute rest time as it is to cook them to 160 ºF, the previously recommended temperature, with no rest time. The new cooking recommendations reflect the same standards that the agency uses for cooked meat products produced in federally inspected meat establishments, which rely on the rest time of three minutes to achieve a safe product. Having a single time and temperature combination for all meat will help consumers remember the temperature at which they can be sure the meat is safe to eat. How Do You Use a Food Thermometer? Place the food thermometer in the thickest part of the food. It should not touch bone, fat, or gristle. Start checking the temperature toward the end of cooking, but before you expect it to be done. Be sure to clean your food thermometer with hot soapy water before and after each use. To see where to place a food thermometer in different cuts of meat, see Thermometer Placement and Temperatures. For more information on cooking temperatures for all types of food, see the Safe Minimum Cooking Temperatures chart. If you have questions about cooking meat, feel free to contact us at the Hotline or online at Ask USDA.

"Under Secretary, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  May 21,   I had the distinct pleasure of visiting the birthplace of former Agriculture Secretary Henry A. Wallace during a recent trip to Iowa.  In fact, my tour of the farm near Orient in south central Iowa happened to be May 15, the day the USDA celebrated its 150th anniversary. Wallace was Secretary of the Agriculture from March 4, until September 4, .  He served as Vice President of the United States from to under President Franklin D. Roosevelt and was also Secretary of Commerce from to . Wallace is perhaps the 20th Century’s most well-known Ag Secretary and his accomplishments are monumental. The Wallace Centers of Iowa. Henry A. Wallace was born in Iowa and went on to serve as Vice President and as cabinet secretary of two departments, including USDA. He helped guide the creation of the Farm Security Administration, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the Rural Electrification Administration (REA). USDA Rural Development, the mission area that I lead, traces its roots back to the REA. Food stamps (now the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP) and the school lunch programs were also started during Wallace’s time as Ag Secretary. Wallace was also dedicated to research and science. The USDA’s research center in Beltsville, Maryland, became the largest and most varied scientific research station in the world during his time as Secretary. My visit to Wallace’s birthplace also served another purpose as the Wallace Centers of Iowa recently received a $50,ep at a Time. This program is helping farmers in southwest Iowa add value to the fruit and vegetable they harvest by providing guidance and training on such things as food safety protocols, recipe development and testing and product placement. More and more people want to know where their food is coming from and are requesting locally grown foods. They also recognize the importance of supporting local producers and local economies. Agriculture Under Secretary for Rural Development speaks about the Department's 150th anniversary during an event at the Wallace Country Life Center I want to thank Diane Weiland and all her wonderful staff for such a great time at the Henry A. Wallace Country Life Center. It was a tremendous way to celebrate the 150th anniversary.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Dec 01,  BAC!®, the Discovery Zone’s “green bacteria” mascot greets Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show attendees as they line up to tour the interactive and educational Food Safety Discovery Zone.  Last month, thousands of foodies packed into the Washington Convention Center for the Metropolitan Cooking and Entertaining Show to gain culinary wisdom from like Paula Deen, Guy Fieri, Giada De Laurentiis, and… the USDA Food Safety Discovery Zone. Among the live demonstrations and more than 300 vendors, there consistently was a line of people waiting for a tour of the Food Safety Discovery Zone. Chefs and guests alike remarked about the 40-foot long yellow truck’s uniqueness, and everyone who toured the interactive exhibit learned something new. A favorite game among visitors was trying to guess which of two identical-looking burgers had been cooked to 160 °F and was safe to eat. Using a food thermometer to check their answer, many were shocked to see that they had guessed wrong! As they exited the Discovery Zone, people grabbed free copies of the Kitchen Companion handbook, keychains with food safety reminders, and food thermometers. One couple returned to the Discovery Zone late in the afternoon to report their shock that a vendor touched raw meat and then served them a cooked sample without washing his hands. “Really? Well, it’s good that you noticed!  It’s scary, right? It’s so easy to get sick if people don’t follow our recommendations,” Discovery Zone staffer Eileen Dykes told them, smiling. “You now know what you can do to protect yourselves and your loved ones!” BAC!®, the Discovery Zone’s “green bacteria” costumed mascot posed for pictures with younger visitors.

"Technical Information Specialist, USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline in  Health and Safety  Mar 25,  Food safety is a key ingredient for a successful meal. Visit FoodSafety.gov for more information on the four key food safety steps: clean, separate, cook and chill. Ahh, Spring! This week, a new season is getting a nice kick-off with Passover and Easter holidays. These celebrations are filled with traditional meals that have unique food safety considerations that may or may not be included in the family recipe book. The USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline has some food safety tips and steps here that, if added to your favorite recipes, can reduce the risk of food poisoning.  As with any food preparation, always remember to Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill. Before preparing any meal, wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, and clean surfaces and utensils with hot soapy water before and after handling raw food. Perishable food should not be left out for more than two hours at room temperature, so check the time at your gathering and make sure either to get food back in the refrigerator or to discard it. Refrigerated leftovers for all foods in this blog should be used within four days.  Beef Brisket: One reason that it’s an excellent choice for entertaining is that it can be prepared in advance. In fact, you must prepare it in advance and cook it slowly to make it tender. Also, because it can be cooked ahead of time and it reheats well, brisket is a great cut of meat to serve to large groups.  Follow these food safety tips for cooking and serving brisket: Be sure to allow plenty of time to thaw a frozen brisket. Thawing in the refrigerator can take about 24 hours for a trimmed, first-cut brisket. A whole brisket weighing about 10 pounds can take several days. Keep raw meat refrigerated at 40 ˚F or below until ready to cook. Place the meat on a plate or container to hold the juices that can drip on other foods to prevent cross-contamination. Bake the brisket, fat side up in a baking dish, in an oven set no lower than 325 ˚F. The brisket is safe to eat when it reaches an internal temperature of 145 °F and is allowed to rest at that temperature for three minutes. Use a food thermometer to be sure. For personal preferences, consumers may choose to cook the brisket longer for tenderness. If reheating brisket before serving, remember to reheat to 165 °F.To serve brisket cold, keep it at 40 °F or below by nesting dishes in beds of ice, or use small servings platters and replace them often. Ham: There are many kinds of hams on the market, but your family likely is purchasing a fully cooked ham. Here are tips for storing and serving a fully cooked ham: When buying a ham, look for the USDA or State Mark of Inspection.  Refrigerate the ham at 40 ˚F or below immediately after arriving home. These hams are best served cold. However, if you want to reheat them, set the oven at 325 ˚F and heat to an internal temperature of 140 °F as measured with a food thermometer. If the ham was repackaged at your butcher shop or grocer, reheat it to 165 °F. Individual slices may also be warmed in a skillet or microwave. Deviled Eggs: Follow these food safety tips below for making an egg dish such as deviled eggs. Remember, eggs are perishable just like raw meat, poultry, and fish, and could contain pathogens. Our virtual food safety expert, Ask Karen, has helpful instructions on how to boil eggs. After cooking the eggs, it is a good idea to keep the whites refrigerated while preparing the filling. Keep deviled eggs chilled until you are ready to serve. Eggs should not stay at room temperature for more than 2 hours. Use a cooler with ice when transporting to another location.

"Chief of Staff, Natural Resources and Environment in  Conservation  Forestry  Sep 26,  Daniel Stevenson, carpentry student of the Harpers Ferry Job Corps Center shows Tom Tidwell, Chief, U.S. Forest Service a map he created of the ates Department of Agriculture in Washington, DC, Wed. Sept. 17, . The U.S. Forest Service operates the Job Corps Civilian Conservation Corps, the Nation’s largest residential, educational and career technical training program for young Americans. USDA photo by Bob Nichols. Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed into law the Economic Opportunity Act.  This Act, part of the government effort to wipe out poverty, created the Job Corps program, which has had a positive effect on countless young lives, giving them a chance to break multi-generational cycles of poverty, get an education, and find jobs in the federal and private sectors, and in the military.  The U.S. Forest Service works closely with the Department of Labor to operate Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers (Job Corps CCCs) around the country. Last week, dignitaries including Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell, and Tina Terrell, Forest Service National Director of the Job Corps, along with colleagues from the Department of Labor, came together in Washington at USDA’s Whitten Building to mark the anniversary. As Chief of Staff for Natural Resources and Environment here at USDA, I am a passionate advocate for this program. Not only does it change families, it allows students to practice conservation on public lands and it also creates a trained group of firefighters to battle wildfire. In the previous two fiscal years, Job Corps CCC students accomplished more than 500,000 hours of service work on public lands. This year, we connected nearly 1,500 of our Job Corps students to training opportunities as part of the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps . In addition to work on public lands, Job Corps CCC students also work on projects that contribute to their local community. During the anniversary event, Deputy Under Secretary Butch Blazer, who grew up on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in New Mexico, spoke of the profound difference that was made when one of America’s first Job Corps centers came to his reservation. “We learned a lot, and it added to the diversity of our community.” He talked about how the Center and others like it produced success and gave students hope for the future. Chief Tidwell thanked everyone, but especially the students, past and present. He acknowledged the partnership forged with the U.S. Department of Labor and commented that during the summer of passage of the Economic Opportunity Act, the Wilderness Act and the Civil Rights Act made history in America.  As important as the last 50 years have been, the Chief said, this is “a moment in history, a time to reflect and celebrate, but also a time to dream of what is next.” National Director Tina Terrell, born in Philadelphia, said that the Job Corps allows students access to the path she took, going from a life where all she knew about trees was “that they were in my back yard” to a fulfilling career with the Forest Service. “The future is up to you,” she said, “Culinary arts, Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, or an avenue for you if you want to work in the Forest Service.” She said it best: “After 50 years, it is all about love of nature, love of the land, and helping young folks. Fifty years down, and now on to the next 50.”  Category/Topic:  Conservation  Forestry  Tags:  21st Century Conservation Service Corps  Butch Blazer  Conservation  Department of Labor  economic opportunity  Forestry  FS  Job Corps  Job Corps Civilian Conservation Centers  New Mexico  NRE  President Johnson  Tom Tidwell  Washington DC","What impact has the Job Corps program had on young Americans, particularly in terms of breaking multi-generational cycles of poverty and providing career training opportunities?","The Job Corps program has had a positive effect on countless young lives, giving them a chance to break multi-generational cycles of poverty, get an education, and find jobs in the federal and private sectors, and in the military.

"Thanksgiving Is a Great Time to Start Reducing Food Waste with Friends & Family  Thanksgiving is a time to appreciate all that is good in our lives and to spend it in the company of friends and family while enjoying great food.  It is also a time to reflect on the bounty of our food supply.  Each year, as I put away the leftovers from my Thanksgiving dinner, I marvel at the abundance. I also can’t avoid pausing to consider how much food is wasted in this country. USDA estimates that on average, American consumers waste about one-fifth of food that is available to them, equivalent to about $371 per person annually.  That’s enough money to buy about 21 whole turkeys for each person in the country.  Dr. Elise Golan, USDA Food Waste Challenge Team  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Nov 24,   1 Response","What is the estimated amount of money wasted on food per person annually in the US, equivalent to how many whole turkeys could be purchased with that amount?","$371 per person annually, which is enough to buy about 21 whole turkeys."
"Philly Market Rises Up to Meet Hunger Challenge  Did you know that nearly one-third of the food available to U.S. retailers and consumers never makes it to the dining room table?  That’s 133 billion pounds of food going to waste--all of which has far-reaching impacts on food security, resource conservation, and climate change.  Experts have projected that reducing food waste by just 15 percent would provide the equivalent of enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year. That’s why my agency, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), decided to help tackle the problem by sponsoring the Terminal Market Food Waste Challenge.  Produce markets across the U.S. joined the friendly 90-day competition by making sure that usable fruits and vegetables were not thrown away.  While these fresh foods weren’t picture-perfect supermarket quality or simply didn’t sell, they were healthy, wholesome foods that could be made into juices, added to animal feeds, used for compost, or donated to charity.  Bruce Summers, Agricultural Marketing Service Associate Administrator  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 06,   Respond to this story","What percentage of food available to U.S. retailers and consumers could be saved by reducing food waste by just 15%, and what would be the equivalent benefit for American food security?","Reducing food waste by 15% would save approximately one-third (33%) of the wasted food, which is equivalent to enough food for more than 25 million Americans every year."

"Merrigan Meets Main Street in Momence, Illinois  This week, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Kathleen Merrigan toured the Main Street of Momence, Il, to view the positive growth made possible by USDA’s investments in rural revitalization. The community was decorated with corn stalks and fall mums to welcome Agriculture Deputy Secretary Merrigan to this town of 3,200 people, located 50 miles south of Chicago.  Merrigan and Momence residents enthusiastically toured several businesses that received financing thanks to a USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG), administered by the USDA Rural Development agency.  Last year USDA provided a $99,000 grant to “Main Street Momence,” a preservation and volunteer based economic development program, to help them establish a revolving, low-interest loan fund.  The program is designed to help small businesses locate or remain in Momence’s historic downtown area. Thirteen months later, four businesses have taken advantage of the increased access to credit by taking out loans. As a result, these businesses have created 27 new full time jobs and saved another 21 in this past year alone.

"Office of Communications in  Conservation  USDA Results  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Rural  Technology  Feb 03,  In the 151 years since the U.S. Department of Agriculture was founded, America's oldest industry has evolved to meet the changing needs of our modern agricultural landscape. From growing overseas markets, building a 21st century rural infrastructure, and finding ways to address the challenges of climate change, USDA has worked beside farmers, businesses, and community leaders to streamline programs and spur innovative solutions for today's challenges. For USDA, that also means looking inward and changing the way we do business. We have done this by designing initiatives that collectively utilize the full scope of our mission, better focusing resources and staff across the Department to meet the needs of the communities we serve using modern tools, technology, and processes. USDA's recently expanded StrikeForce for Rural Growth and Opportunity initiative illustrates this trend with a broad commitment to rally available tools and technical assistance to combat persistent poverty in rural communities in 20 states. Our Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative aims to support the rapidly expanding local and regional food market with new products and services, as well as tailored cross-agency web resources and that illustrate opportunities and promote local and regional food systems. And finally, through the Blueprint for Stronger Service, USDA responded to the uncertain fiscal environment by streamlining mission critical work and taking a close look at operations to find ways to cut costs and modernize processes to be better stewards of taxpayer dollars - with great results. Over the next month we'll share more about the ways that USDA has evolved to meet the needs of modern agriculture in America. We'll use hashtag  on social media to share these stories, but we want to hear from you too.

"Public Information Coordinator – USDA-Rural Development – Alaska in  Rural  Dec 01,   They say nothing beats teamwork and that can certainly be said about a very forward-thinking and ambitious project being led by USDA-Rural Development in Alaska. USDA-RD Alaska State Director Jim Nordlund is leading the efforts to coordinate several federal agencies in organizing statewide collaboration meetings with Alaska tribal governments.  The collaboration will involve 12-18 meetings held over the next eleven months.  This effort is in response to a memorandum signed by President Obama directing federal agencies to engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials. There are 229 federally recognized tribes in Alaska and nearly all coincide with rural villages.  The USDA led plan involves face-to-face collaboration meetings with the acknowledged leader or single point of contact for each tribe. The meetings will be held in local communities and will involve a conversation with several tribal leaders in an area that is geographically distinct and culturally homogenous. “Collaboration with 229 tribes in their local areas is a large undertaking, but we feel this is the best way to understand the needs of Native communities and to seek their advice,” said Nordlund.     “Through these meetings we hope to strengthen the government-to-government relationship between tribal leaders and the federal government; provide an overview, by topic, of certain federal programs that have an effect on tribes; and engage in constructive dialogue, respond to questions and solicit ideas regarding federal programs,” added Nordlund. The consultation discussions will be focused on five topics: Food production, availability and nutrition Rural housing Natural Resources Conservation Service and Forest Service Rural utilities (electric, telecom, solid waste, sewer and water) Rural economic and community development Five USDA agencies will participate in the meetings, including Rural Development, Farm Service Agency, Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), Forest Service, and Food and Nutrition Service.  Additionally, five other federal agencies with similar programs will be represented, including: Department of Housing and Urban Development, Small Business Administration, Economic Development Administration, Department of Energy and the Denali Commission. USDA Farm Service Agency Executive State Director Danny Consenstein said, “Food security is a big issue in our rural areas.  Not only are fish and game important, but growing more local  produce can create jobs, healthier food, and more self-sufficient communities.  I’m excited to talk with and learn from tribal leaders about this important topic.” ""I look forward to participating in the collaborations and hearing directly from tribal leaders about what they need and expect from federal agencies.  It will be an opportunity to explain our programs and the assistance we can provide,” said Bob Jones, State Conservationist for the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Alaska Inter-Tribal Council (AITC) will be coordinating the logistics for the meetings.  The places and dates for the meeting will be determined by the tribes in consultation with AITC.

Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Mudders, take note: It is against the law to tear up forest roads and meadows for fun, and the legal and financial consequences can be steep. Tearing up high-country meadows with four-wheel-drive and off-road vehicles destroys wildlife habitat and ecosystems. During a recent investigation, Forest Service law enforcement officers gathered information about mudding that occurred over Memorial Day weekend on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest at Buck Lake Campground, near Winthrop, Wash. A meadow near the campground was torn up by vehicles. Where there was green grass there are now mud pits and tire tracks. The activities that caused this damage are illegal under both state and federal law. Participants could face charges including malicious mischief and fines up to and including paying for the costs of restoration. Smoothing ruts, reseeding or planting and repairing roadbeds cost a lot of money. Mudding, or driving through wet areas and puddles while mud sprays up onto a vehicle is considered fun by some motor sports enthusiasts. Some people enjoy the challenge of maneuvering a vehicle through a situation where they could get stuck, or they may simply get a thrill out of seeing how high they can fling mud. There are websites and groups that cater to this interest and there are places, mostly private land (with a landowners permission), where such activities are allowed. But a national forest is not such a place. The results of this incident on the Okanogan-Wenatchee are a familiar sight to natural resource specialists across the Forest Service. There is a difference between acceptable use of off-highway vehicles and mudding -- tearing through grass to expose underlying soil or unnecessarily driving through a soft spot in the road. Spinning tires on plants destroys the plants, leaving behind bare dirt. When plants are gone, there is nothing to stop soil from washing into nearby streams and lakes. Muddy streams and lakes are bad for fish, wildlife, irrigators and recreationists, and many local towns depend on clean water and tourism for survival. When native plants are gone, noxious weeds move in. A meadow of native grasses and flowers may soon become a field of thistles and knapweed. Believe it or not, mudding actually compacts soil. It’s hard for plants to grow in compacted soil. Healthy soil should bounce a bit when you walk on it. Tire tracks create hard, dried-up soil where water runs down tire tracks and into creeks and lakes, carrying mud and pollutants with it. Meadows and wetlands provide important breeding, rearing and foraging habitats for many birds and other animals. Tearing-up these areas removes nesting and hiding cover, decreases forage, interferes with feeding and pushes animals out into areas where they may not survive. Off-highway vehicles are permitted on designated trails within the National Forest System. These trails are built specifically to minimize the impact of vehicles on fragile ecosystems such as meadows and streams. Many trails are maintained by volunteers and are prime examples of citizens acting as stewards of public land.

"USDA state-by-state show top states for Federal local food investments include Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas and Alabama  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .15  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  WASHINGTON, June 30, — Today, the Obama Administration invited communities to participate in Local Foods, Local Places, a federal initiative providing direct technical support to build strong local food systems as part of a community's emerging economic action plans. Under this effort, a team of agricultural, transportation, public health, environmental, and regional economic experts will work directly with local communities to spur local economic growth and improve the quality of life for all residents.Local food sales topped $11.7 billion in according to industry estimates, underscoring the economic benefit that a local food system can offer a community. As part of today's announcement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) released an updated state-by-state ""Made in Rural America"" report illustrating the impact of USDA's investments in rural communities, including local food. USDA has invested more than $800 million in more than 29,100 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects over the past six years.""These state by state analyses reaffirm that local food is rapidly growing from a niche market to an integrated system recognized for its economic boost to communities across the country,"" said Secretary Vilsack. ""Local food creates new market opportunities for farmers, brings fresh meals into schools and other institutions, expands healthy food access to underserved communities, and builds infrastructure needed to support ranchers and other meat processors. By investing in projects at the local level, this Administration is encouraging growth in this sector and creating new opportunities for families who live in rural America.""This is the second year of the Local Foods, Local Places program. In , 26 rural and urban communities participated in the program to create year-round, downtown markets featuring foods from local farmers; establish retail outlets to help revitalize small-town main streets; build centrally located community kitchens or food hubs to aggregate and market local foods; support business incubators to help entrepreneurs start food-related businesses on main streets; enhance public spaces for people to walk or bicycle to farmers markets and local restaurants; assist schoolchildren to grow their own food and make healthy local food accessible to families, including via SNAP benefits; and develop community gardens in walkable, transit-accessible places.Technical support teams through Local Foods, Local Places helped Osceola, Arkansas (pop 7,700) develop a new health foods cooking curriculum for the local school district, create a plan for a new downtown farmers market and implement infrastructure improvement efforts; guided North Little Rock, Arkansas (population 62,000) to enhance the livability of an emerging neighborhood though a new food hub; and worked with Wheeling, West Virginia (pop 28,000) to revitalize underused property into a community orchard, multi-use food facility, and a mobile market.Local Foods, Local Places is a partnership between USDA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DoT), the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), and the Delta Regional Authority (DRA). The effort is part of the White House Rural Council's ""Rural Impact"" effort to improve quality of life and upward mobility for kids and families in rural and tribal communities. Together, the agencies are investing $800,000 to support this round of assistance. Application and deadlines are available on line.Since , USDA has invested in 29,100 food hubs, small scale processing, farmers market and other opportunities in local food across all 50 states and the US territories. This includes USDA investments in the local food sector through over 12,000 microloans, smaller loans of up to $50,000 for small-scale producers who often sell products locally; and over 13,000 high tunnels, low-cost covered structures that extend the growing season and make locally-grown products available later into the year.Among the top ten states with federally funded local food projects are Kentucky, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Minnesota, West Virginia, Iowa, and Michigan. Five of these states (Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and West Virginia) are part USDA's StrikeForce Initiative for Rural Growth and Opportunity which coordinates USDA assistance in the Nation's most economically challenged rural areas.Many of these projects can be found on the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass. Searchable by state, zip code, project type and funding program, the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Compass maps federal local food investments made by USDA and 10 other federal agencies between fiscal years -. The Compass is part of the USDA's Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food Initiative. Secretary Vilsack has identified local and regional food systems as one of the four pillars of rural economic development, along with production agriculture, the bio-based economy, and natural resources and conservation.The state by state fact sheets are available at www.usda.gov/opportunities.

"Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator in  Trade  Oct 22,  Trade visitors sample a variety of cheeses at the Rogue Creamery stand in the USA Pavilion. Rogue Creamery, an artisan cheese company, is dedicated to sustainability and the art and tradition of making the world's finest handmade cheese. Earlier this week I traveled to Paris to attend the 24th edition of the Salon International d’Alimentation (SIAL). This 5-day event is one of the largest international food and beverage trade exhibitions in the world, attracting 5,500 exhibitors and over 147,000 trade-only visitors representing 188 countries. I was very impressed by the wide variety of U.S. products on display and by the number of participating countries. For nearly 20 years, the United States has participated in SIAL Paris. This year’s USA Pavilion at SIAL was the largest to date, with some 140 exhibitors occupying over 2,700 square meters. SIAL offers U.S. food exporters the opportunity to test products and meet with European as well as other international traders and industry professionals. Clearly, this is a major factor for the large U.S. presence. One of my primary reasons for attending the show was to meet face to face with U.S. Cooperators, exhibitors, and importers from Europe and other regions, as well as industry leaders. I had the pleasure of talking with many small- and medium-sized companies and Cooperator groups who expressed their appreciation of our programs and services, including American Food Service, Head Country Food Products, Rogue Creamery, U.S. Meat Export Federation, USA Poultry and Egg Export Council, and representatives from the state regional trade groups (SRTG), just to name a few. Tuesday night’s SRTG-hosted trade reception, as well as an industry reception, was yet another wonderful opportunity to talk with Pavilion exhibitors and trade visitors. Reception guests included buyer groups from North Africa and the Middle East recruited by our FAS Field offices. The European Union (EU) is a major trading partner for the United States. The EU is America’s fifth largest market for agricultural and food products. France alone imports nearly $1 billion of U.S. farm goods annually. However, the scope of SIAL extended beyond the EU, reaching importers from all corners of the world. Building a market presence is sometimes a long process, and participation in these types of trade shows introduces foreign buyers and consumers more quickly and effectively to the attributes and advantages of American products. Looking back on the response of visitors to the wide variety of U.S. food and beverage products showcased in the Pavilion, I am optimistic that the demand for U.S. agricultural products is strong, and our reputation as a reliable supplier of safe, wholesome, and innovative products is excellent. For information on other upcoming trade events, please visit our home page at www.fas.usda.gov or contact Maria.Nemeth-Ek@fas.usda.gov.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Sep 11,   Evelyn Eagleman, 63, remembers driving the long distance off Rocky Boy’s Indian Reservation, Mont., to rescue her grandson when he was two. His father was serving in the military and his mother had been arrested on drug charges.  The boy needed a new start. She brought the child home to Rocky Boy, where she and her husband, Francis, became the child’s foster parents.  Her grandson, now a teenager, will soon graduate from high school and plans to major in forestry in college.  Eagleman said she and her husband are proud of the man he has become and gives much credit to the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program at Stone Child College, in Box Elder, Mont. “There are a lot of legal issues involved with foster parenting, and I can’t remember them all, but with this program, I know where to go for help,” she said.   “We learned about our rights as foster grandparents.” The Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) through its Tribal College Extension Grant program. This grant allows land-grants institutions, also known as tribal colleges, to provide education to reservation communities. The 32 colleges and universities that receive this funding provide a host of services, depending on the community needs. Stone Child College uses its grant for many youth-focused outreach efforts, as well as the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program.  According to Mary St. Pierre, the Extension project director and leader of the grandparent program, about 10 percent of the community’s children are being raised by grandparents. The U.S. Census that, nationally, 7 million grandparents had grandchildren living with them, a 64 percent increase since . In about one-third of these cases grandparents had assumed a custodial role. The Census that for American Indians, 97,278 grandparents live with their grandchildren and more than half have primary custodial responsibility.  Many times, the parent lives with the family, too, as it is with the Eagleman’s. St. Pierre’s next goal for NIFA’s Tribal College Extension Grant program is to develop a Positive Indian Parenting program that will accompany the Grandparents Raising Grandchildren program. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs in  Health and Safety  Animals  Plants  May 09,  USDA is taking a multi-faceted approach to supporting the American sheep and lamb industry, working with researchers and market analysts to identify strategies and goals. The U.S. sheep and lamb industry has been shrinking for decades as the numbers of sheep and producers have declined since World War II.  Consolidation of the sheep packing industry, higher feed and energy costs, continuous loses to predation, and lower consumption, coupled with competition from imports of lamb cuts, have taken their toll on U.S. producers.  In response to industry needs, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has been working with the American Lamb Board (ALB) and the American Sheep Industry Association (ASI) on initiatives aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of the industry. The ALB recently initiated a study to identify the challenges, propose solutions, and develop strategies to strengthen the industry’s competitive advantage.  By working with a marketing firm and using and services offered by USDA, ALB hopes this study’s findings will help return the industry to profitability.  AMS is ready to assist ALB as they lay the groundwork and identify goals and benchmarks. Another way AMS is assisting the industry is in identifying opportunities to improve Livestock Mandatory Reporting (LMR) for lamb.  LMR was established to collect and publish price and volume information to encourage competition in the marketplace.  However, given the consolidation of the industry, it has become difficult to publish lamb market information on a consistent basis due to the LMR confidentiality requirements.  Last fall, ASI commissioned the Livestock Marketing Information Center (LMIC) to conduct a study of the LMR program, and over the course of 5 months, met with AMS to learn more about how USDA administers the lamb reporting program. The final report proposed improvement recommendations to lamb reporting.  Some of the recommendations included lowering the reporting thresholds for packers and importers, evaluating the confidentiality policy for LMR, and eliminating categories and that do not have utility. AMS has reviewed the report and is engaged with ASI to determine the best solutions for the recommendations.  While some of the recommendations will require regulatory changes, many of the proposals can be addressed easily.  In fact, AMS has already eliminated the western regional lamb , changed the National daily lamb report to a weekly report, modified the reported weight categories, and removed unused purchase type categories. AMS is working with ASI on other projects, such as determining ways in which slaughter lambs are bought to ensure that the LMR purchase types are still relevant.  AMS is also working to develop strategies to more accurately define the lamb maturity window for the grade standards and will work with FSIS on a more agreeable term for “yearling mutton” such as “yearling lamb.” AMS and ASI are cooperating on the potential development of a lamb tenderness standard, and the potential development of a non-hormone treated lamb export certification protocol with the European Union. The ALB and ASI recently received USDA approval to explore lamb instrument grading, through funding received from the National Sheep Industry Improvement Center.  The project will be a two phased approach to finalizing USDA’s standardization of the concept and evaluating the benefits and return on the investment to garner industry acceptance. The USDA is committed to working with our partners in the industry to not only meet these challenges but to succeed in creating an industry that provides quality products to consumers and increased producer returns here at home.

Photo by A. Jay, Chun-Li Integrated Marketing and Communications Co., Ltd Thanks to Foreign Agricultural Service employees serving at USDA’s 98 international posts, American Thanksgiving traditions – and food – are being enjoyed around the world this November.  This is certainly the case in Taiwan, where the Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Taipei teamed with China TV to highlight the holiday on an episode of the popular TV show “King of the Happy Life” this week. Valerie Brown from ATO Taipei was joined by Daisy Hong, who represents the grower-owned cooperative Ocean Spray, and chef C.K. Chen from Taipei’s Sherwood Hotel. In addition to Thanksgiving staples like turkey and pumpkin pie, they featured new recipes, including stuffing and hot cranberry-apple cider made with Ocean Spray products. After taping the show, Chen began taking orders for traditional American Thanksgiving baskets, which the Sherwood Hotel sells every year. Not only do these baskets feature traditional American dishes, many of the ingredients are exported by the United States, including turkey, cranberries, broccoli, potatoes, beets, lettuce and California wine. Following the Thanksgiving episode of “King of the Happy Life” last year, Chen was so overwhelmed with orders that he had to limit the number of baskets available this year. The popularity of these Thanksgiving baskets is reflective of increased demand for U.S. food and agriculture around the world.  Earlier this month, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that U.S. agricultural exports reached a record $137.4 billion in fiscal year , which exceeds the previous record by $22.5 billion. The agricultural trade surplus soared to a record $42.7 billion in FY. This rise in exports is good news for all Americans, especially considering every $1 billion of U.S. agricultural exports supports 8,400 American jobs. Last year alone, agricultural exports helped support 1.15 million jobs. And that gives us all a reason to be thankful.

"Director, USDA Agricultural Trade Office, Tokyo in  Trade  Mar 27,   Helping U.S. exporters tap into Japan’s $670 billion food market is a top priority for the Foreign Agricultural Service’s Agricultural Trade Office (ATO) in Japan. One way we do this is by organizing the USA Pavilion at FOODEX Japan, the largest food and beverage trade show in Asia. This year’s show, which was held March 6-9, drew 74,000-plus attendees, not just from Japan but also from other Asian markets including Korea, Taiwan, China, Thailand and Hong Kong. U.S. Ambassador to Japan John V. Roos (right) visits a U.S. organic onion exhibit at the USDA-endorsed FOODEX Japan. The food and beverage show took place March 6-9 and is the largest show of its kind in Asia. The U.S. Pavilion was one of the largest at the show and featured more than 70 companies. (Photo Courtesy of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo) The USA Pavilion was one of the largest at the show, featuring more than 70 U.S. companies and a wide range of “Made in America” products, including meat and seafood, fresh produce, wine and specialty snack foods. Participants had an opportunity to showcase their wares to key decision-makers from restaurants, supermarkets, wholesalers, grocery stores, foodservice and hospitality companies, fast food chains and convenience stores, as well as distributors, agents and brokers. Japan is the world’s third-largest economy and the United States’ fourth-largest agricultural export customer, purchasing a record $15.6 billion of U.S. agricultural, forestry and fishery goods in . For U.S. companies, entry into the lucrative Japanese market is often the first step towards expansion to the rest of Asia. That’s why our ATO strives to help U.S. companies shine at the FOODEX show, providing logistical support and briefings, offering samples of U.S. products at a “Gateway to American Food” demonstration area, and helping match U.S. exhibitors with potential business contacts. While final results from the show are not yet in, a preliminary survey indicates U.S. exhibitors made more than $13 million in projected sales. Over three years, more than 1,000 U.S. companies and organizations—about 70 percent of them small and medium sized businesses—participated in 87 USDA-endorsed trade shows in 20 countries. On-site sales totaled more than $350 million and 12-month projected sales reported by exhibitors were estimated more than $2.7 billion. The companies made over 42,000 business contacts and displayed nearly 20,000 new products in various markets on all continents.  Trade shows give companies even more opportunities to make business contacts and share their products with potential buyers and consumers. Currently, the American brand of agriculture is surging in popularity worldwide. Farm exports in fiscal year reached a record high of $137.4 billion—exceeding past highs by $22.5 billion—and supported 1.15 million jobs here at home.

"Taking Charge: How Rural Residents Are Switching from Employees to Business Owners  The retirement of the baby boom generation of business proprietors is predicted to result in a major turnover in ownership. Developing an ownership succession plan is especially challenging in rural areas where many small businesses are at risk of closing from the lack of locally available financing to keep them in operation. Rural Development’s Business and Industry (B&I) Guaranteed Loan Program now has new capabilities as of this August that specifically accommodate the needs of financing ownership succession. B&I guarantee borrowers can now apply to loans for financing the transfer of business ownership within a family, usually involving a sale from parents to children. Prior to recent changes in the rules it was assumed that within families the transfer of ownership was always a seller-financed transaction. Yet, some retiring business owners may need to immediately take the sales revenue out to finance their retirement.

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world’s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack’s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA’s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization’s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA’s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA’s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways. The Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice. The size of the gift matters much less than the fact that each employee participates on some level.

"Assistant to the Director, USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  May 24,   Cross posted from the Let's Move! blog:  There’s a lot going on in the Church Hill North neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia! For three years, the congregation at 31st Street Baptist Church has been growing fresh vegetables in an urban garden behind their church. More recently, they launched a healthy living campaign to encourage the congregation and the surrounding community to get active and eat more nutritious foods. Led by Rev. Dr. Henderson, who serves as senior pastor, 31st Street Baptist Church has acquired three city lots behind their church. The congregants have a large community garden with 24 cultivated raised beds in one of the lots. The garden provides healthy, fresh produce to a community without close access to a grocery store. The majority of the produce from the garden is used in the church’s nutrition center, which has served members of the local community for 21 years and receives some of its food via USDA’s Emergency Food Assistance (TEFAP) program. The 31st Street Baptist Church garden is already growing peas, radishes, beets, and greens this season. Photo courtesy of Master Gardener Linda Marshall and Jacquelin Henderson 31st Street Baptist Church provides a great example of how to partner with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on multiple fronts. The church has partnered with Virginia Cooperative Extension and local master gardeners for technical assistance in growing food and teaching about nutrition. They will be starting a 4-H youth development club with two neighboring churches and teenagers from the Mayor’s Youth Conservation Corps also help tend part of the garden. The church has plans to launch a large farmers market this summer with produce from the garden and area farmers, and they will be holding a youth summer camp focused on healthy living in August. And there’s more: this spring marked the planting of a new flower garden in one of their other lots. The plan is to sell the cut flowers to other churches in the area to raise revenue and teach youth about entrepreneurship. The third open lot will be developed as a Zen garden, providing a space for tranquility in the neighborhood. Pastor Henderson’s goal is to “rally congregants around changing their lifestyles” while “respecting the dignity of the people who come to garden.” To learn more about increasing access to healthy affordable food in your community, please visit Let’s Move!

"U.S. Navy, Department of Agriculture and Department of Energy Announce Funding Available for Commercial Scale Advanced Drop-In Biofuels; Energy Department Also Announces Additional Biofuel Investments to Drive Cost Reductions and Technological Breakthroughs  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .12  Contact:USDA Office of Communications   720-  AudioWASHINGTON. D.C., July 2, – As part of the Obama Administration's commitment to deploying every available source of American energy and reducing our reliance on imported oil, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced new funding available to pursue new innovations in biofuels technologies, increase production of U.S. biofuels, and strengthen American energy security. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), Navy and Department of Energy are announcing $30 million in federal funding to match private investments in commercial-scale advanced drop-in biofuels. The Energy Department is also announcing a total of $32 million in new investments for earlier stage research that will continue to drive technological breakthroughs and additional cost reductions in the industry.Advancing Commercial-Scale Drop-In Biofuel Substitutes for Diesel and Jet FuelIn his Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future released in March , President Obama set a goal of reducing oil imports by one-third by and laid out an all-of-the-above energy plan to achieve that goal by developing domestic oil and gas energy resources, increasing energy efficiency, and speeding development of biofuels and other alternatives. Domestic oil and gas production has increased each year the President has been in office. At the same time we continue to take additional steps to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. As part of that effort, the Blueprint directed the Navy, USDA and DOE to collaborate to support commercialization of ""drop-in"" biofuel substitutes for diesel and jet fuel. Competitively-priced drop-in biofuels will help improve America's energy security, meeting the fuel needs of U.S. armed forces, as well as the commercial aviation and shipping sectors. Today's announcement of an available $30 million in funding builds on that commitment, helping to speed the development of biofuels for military and commercial transportation that will reduce the need for foreign oil and strengthen rural America. The Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is available HERE.Made possible through the Defense Production Act (DPA), this funding opportunity enhances national security by supporting the creation and commercial viability of a defense-critical domestic biofuels industry to advance alternatives to petroleum. DPA is an authority that dates back to and has been used to boost industries such as steel, aluminum, titanium, semiconductors, beryllium, and radiation-hardened electronics.""DPA is a critical component of strengthening our national security, and energy is a national security issue,"" stated Secretary Mabus. ""Our reliance on foreign oil is a significant military vulnerability and it would be irresponsible not to address it. Pursuing a viable, domestic alternative is the best way to preserve the budget for operational necessities like training and shipbuilding, and this funding opportunity is an important step in accelerating an economically self-sufficient alternative fuels market.""The FOA comprises a two-phased approach, with government and industry sharing in the cost. In Phase 1, applicants will submit a design package and comprehensive business plan for a commercial-scale biorefinery, identify and secure project sites and take additional steps spelled out in the announcement. Awardees selected to continue into Phase 2 will submit additional information for the construction or retrofit of a biorefinery.Agencies participating in this initiative will make additional funding requests to Congress to support the initiative, including President Obama's budget request of $110 million.""This is an important time for the biofuels industry to step up and show the Department of the Navy how they have developed biofuels that are certified and certifiable for military use,"" stated Secretary Vilsack. ""The ability for U.S. industry to make, create and innovate has never been more important to our national and energy security. I know that through this DPA effort the nation will be able to harvest an aviation biofuels industry to satisfy the world's needs, not just our U.S. military.""Investments in Biofuels Research, Development and Demonstration to Drive Cost Reductions, Technological BreakthroughsToday, the Energy Department is also announcing new investments in earlier stage biofuels research that complement the commercial-scale efforts announced today by the Navy and USDA. Totaling $32 million, these early-stage, pre-commercial investments are the latest steps in the Obama Administration's efforts to advance biofuels technologies to continue to bring down costs, improve performance, and identify new effective, non-food feedstocks and processing technologies.""Advanced biofuels are an important part of President Obama's all-of-the-above strategy to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil and support American industries and American jobs,"" said Secretary Chu. ""By pursuing new processes and technologies for producing next-generation biofuels, we are working to accelerate innovation in a critical and growing sector that will help to improve U.S. energy security and protect our air and water.""The funding announced by DOE today includes $20 million to support innovative pilot-scale and demonstration-scale biorefineries that could produce renewable biofuels that meet military specifications for jet fuel and shipboard diesel using a variety of non-food biomass feedstocks, waste-based materials and algae. These projects may support new plant construction, retrofits on existing U.S. biorefineries or operation at plants ready to begin production at the pilot- or pre-commercial scale. This investment will also help federal and local governments, private developers and industry collect accurate on the cost of producing fuels made from biomass and waste feedstocks. The full funding solicitation is available HERE.In addition, the Energy Department also announced $12 million to support up to eight projects focused on researching ways to develop biobased transportation fuels and products using synthetic biological processing. Synthetic biological processing offers an innovative technique to enable efficient, cost-saving conversion of non-food biomass to biofuels. These projects will develop novel biological systems that can enhance the breakdown of raw biomass feedstocks and assist in converting feedstocks into transportation fuels.The projects will be led by small businesses, universities, national laboratories and industry and will seek to overcome various technical and scientific barriers to cost-competitive advanced biofuels and bioproducts. The full funding opportunity announcement is available HERE.The new investments announced today build on the steps the Energy Department is already taking to push the boundaries of biofuel technologies and move towards commercial-scale production at refineries across the country.

"USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 23,  Audrey Rowe, USDA Deputy Administrator of Special Nutrition Programs, chats with the Shenandoah Valley Community Breastfeeding support group August 6 in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  I recently had the pleasure to spend a little time with some expecting and nursing mothers in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  It was the first meeting of a newly formed community breastfeeding support group planned to coincide with World Breastfeeding Week.  My friend Mitch Greenbaum, Director of Shenandoah Valley WIC and Nutrition Services, and his team of trained WIC nutritionists, board-certified lactation consultants and breastfeeding peer counselors, hosted nearly two dozen pregnant and nursing mothers to talk about how important breastfeeding is for both mother and child and how to have a satisfying and healthy breastfeeding experience. The women shared stories and got answers to questions new mothers often ask such as: “Does it hurt?”  “What should I do when I’m out in public and need to feed my baby?”  And, “How can I keep feeding my baby after I return to work?”  I shared my personal experiences too; knowing the trepidation and uncertainty a nursing mother experiences.  But Mitch’s team of experts calmed the fear and helped the women feel comfortable about the choice to breastfeed.  The messages helped the women understand how to cope with a busy schedule and perhaps a job, how to involve family and friends, and most importantly, helped the women understand just how nutritionally important breast milk is. Research proves that feeding human milk to young children and the practice of breastfeeding improves the health, immune system, and the development of children. It protects against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), ear infections, upper and lower respiratory infections, allergies, intestinal disorders, colds and viruses.  Breastfeeding also protects mothers against osteoporosis and breast and ovarian cancer.  These nutritional benefits, both for children and for women, last long after breastfeeding has ended. I applaud local WIC and Nutrition Service programs like the one in Shenandoah Valley for their efforts to promote and encourage this vital part of human development.  Through innovative community support groups and local community partnerships; through health provider outreach and public awareness; and through on-line USDA resources such as Loving Support and WIC Works, women, families, and whole communities are more aware of the profound benefits of breastfeeding.

"Administradora del Servicio de Alimentos y Nutrición del USDA in  Food and Nutrition  Dec 11,  Nutricionistas del WIC discuten opciones de alimentos saludables con participantes y niños  Los programas de nutrición del USDA (por siglas en inglés) proveen acceso a una dieta saludable a millones de americanos elegibles para las ayudas cada mes. Ya sea en escuelas, centros comunitarios o en casas de todo el país, estos programas trabajan en conjunto como una red de seguridad nutritiva para asegurar que ningún americano que cualifique pase hambre. Considero que la nutrición suplementar para mujeres, infantes y niños, mejor conocida como WIC (por sus siglas en inglés)  es un programa especial. Dicho programa provee alimentos suplementarios a los más vulnerables—infantes, embarazadas, mujeres lactando y luego del parto y a niños hasta la edad de 5 años que enfrentan un riesgo nutricional. WIC también provee referencias para atención médica y social, y para educación nutritiva, incluyendo la promoción y el soporte a la lactancia materna. Un nuevo reporte del USDA del programa y características de WIC (disponible en ingles) confirma el éxito de estos esfuerzos. Por ejemplo, al revisar la información recopilada se registró un aumento del 4 por ciento en dos años en la participación de madres del programa WIC que lactan sus niños con leche materna. De las agencias estatales que reportaron madres que lactaron a sus hijos en el , se reportó que 67 por ciento de los infantes entre los 6 y 13 meses estaban siendo amamantados o lo estuvieron durante un tiempo en comparación con un 63 por ciento registrado en un estudio anterior que se realizo en el . Es más, la lactancia materna entre participantes de WIC ha estado en continuo aumento desde , y este año por primera vez, el porcentaje de mamas lactantes fue mayor que el número de nuevas madres no lactantes. Los hallazgos son una buena noticia, ya que la lactancia materna es el método ideal de alimentación para infantes, ya que provee beneficios para la mama y el niño. Las ayudas del programa WIC están llegando a madres y niños de escasos recursos. Cerca de tres cuartas partes de los 9 millones de participantes en WIC que reportaron sus ingresos se encuentran por debajo de lo que se considera como pobreza, a comparación del 15 por ciento entre la población general de los Estados Unidos. La mayoría de los que reciben las ayudas de WIC tienen menos de 5 años y más de la mitad de los participantes eran menores de 3 años. Entre otras buenas noticias es importante señalar que la obesidad infantil ha disminuido entre los participantes de WIC(disponible en ingles). En el , el 15.3 por ciento de los niños en WIC de un año confrontaban problemas de obesidad comparado con los hallazgos registrados el 16.8 por ciento en el . De manera similar, en el se reportó que 14.7 por ciento de los niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 experimentaba obesidad mientras que en el la cantidad disminuyo a 14.0 por ciento. El centro para el control de enfermedades profundizo en el estudio usando datos del WIC de 43 estados y territorios de niños entre las edades de 2 y 4 años. Descubrieron que al revés de la tendencia anterior, en 19 de los estados/territorios hubo  reducciones significativas y que 21 de ellos no reportaron problemas de obesidad infantil, con solo 3 mostrando aumentos. WIC ayuda a trazar el futuro de nuestro país de una manera vital al proveer a madres e hijos la nutrición que necesitan para tener embarazos exitosos y en el caso de los niños, un crecimiento saludable. De hecho, investigaciones anteriores han demostrado que las ayudas que ofrece WIC ejercen un papel importante en embarazos ya que ayudan a evitar complicaciones como fiebre, embarazos prematuros o incluso las costosas tarifas de los cuidados de salud. Este es un programa que no solo está proporcionando nutrición a familias de bajos ingresos, pero también reduciendo la mortalidad infantil y en verdad creando una generación futura más saludable.

And according to the most recently released from the Farm to School Census , more than 1,000 school districts nationwide are doing just that:  They’re bringing the farm to summer! When school lets out for summer, there’s still a need to ensure the millions of children who receive free and reduced-price school meals during the school year have consistent access to healthy meals.  USDA’s summer meals programs help fill that gap, serving over 191 million meals to children last summer alone!  Community centers, libraries, day camps, churches, and more can all sign up to host a summer meals site through the summer meals programs, but schools make for a particularly good site since they already have food production facilities in place for serving meals throughout the school year.  The Farm to School Census found that more than one in five school districts that participate in farm to school programs report including local foods in meals served through their summer meals programs. Schools serving as summer meals sites often also offer fun, hands-on activities related to local foods that attract and engage kids in their programming.  Farm to summer activities include growing community gardens, taking a field trip to the farm, and conducting taste tests of local produce. But it’s not just the kids that are benefiting; incorporating local produce into the summer meals programs helps the entire community. Farm to summer arrangements can help increase participation for summer meals, provide a source of income for local growers and producers, and reinforce healthy habits promoted during the school year. To find out more about summer meals sites in your area, visit the Summer Site Finder.  Or to get involved yourself, consider becoming a site sponsor or helping raise awareness in your area.

"Posted by Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack in  USDA Results  Rural  Dec 17,   This week, at my request, USDA Rural Development and Farm Service Agency staff kicked off a series of meetings intended to gather ideas about ways to spark job creation and economic growth in rural America. This request is a direct result of the Forum on Jobs and Economic Growth that President Obama hosted at the White House earlier this month. Because of the importance of this effort, I have asked that these meetings be held in every state, and in territories including Guam and Puerto Rico. We intend to complete all of them by February 1 and provide meeting directly to the White House.  Rural Development State Directors along with Farm Service Agency State Executive Directors, are the hosts and those invited to participate include business owners, members of the community, state and local officials, union representatives, non-profit service providers and economists.  The objective is clear:  discuss steps that can be taken to make the economy grow and put Americans back to work. All of these meetings are public events and anyone with an interest in boosting the economy is welcome to attend. Each State and Executive Director will prepare a report on the meeting in their state and the will be provided to the White House. As I travel across the country, I continue to meet Americans who face great challenges.  It’s important to not only find a way to provide them with opportunities, it is necessary to restore their hope.  President Obama believes in nurturing strong, robust, and vibrant rural communities, but the best way to do that is to find a way to provide those living in rural towns with meaningful, financially rewarding jobs. As a former governor and mayor I know how important this effort is. I hope you’ll participate. To learn more, go to the Rural Development Job Roundtables Schedule and the News Release “USDA to Host Roundtables on Jobs, Economic Growth.” More meetings are being scheduled so if you don’t see your state listed, check back or contact your State Rural Development or FSA office for more information.

"USDA One Health Joint Working Group Co-Chair and Deputy Administrator, Animal Production and Protection, USDA Agricultural Research Service in  Animals  Plants  Nov 18,  ARS scientists identifying bacterial pathogens in the lab. Photo by Peggy Greb. Antibiotics are lifesavers. We depend on them to treat bacterial infections and diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis and strep throat, as well as ear infections and infected wounds. In response to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance, veterinarians and producers are moving toward more judicious antibiotic use in food animals, while keeping them healthy and ensuring that our food supply remains safe. This is especially important because certain bacterial strains have become resistant to some of the current antibiotics used to treat infections in humans and animals, escalating the need worldwide to find and develop alternatives to antibiotics. The USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is developing new technologies to address antibiotic resistance and reduce the use of antibiotics through agricultural management, which includes food, animals, crops and the environment—water, soil and climate. This research falls into USDA’s One Health approach when mitigating the problems associated with antibiotic resistance.  One Health is the concept that the health of animals, the health of people, and the viability of ecosystems are intricately linked. A One Health approach embraces the idea that a disease problem impacting the health of humans, animals, and the environment can only be solved through improved communication, cooperation, and collaboration across disciplines and institutions. With its partners, USDA’s objective through this multidisciplinary approach is to preserve, maintain or reduce health risks to animals, humans, the environment and society. USDA has gained in-depth knowledge about antimicrobial resistance through its work on the agricultural environment, animal health and food safety. Over the years, scientists have developed and patented new technologies that could help reduce the use of antibiotics. Discoveries include using natural supplements like vitamin D to treat a condition of dairy cows called “mastitis,” which affects milk quality and production of cattle. Vitamin D, as well as yeast, also has the potential to treat turkey diseases. In addition, scientists have shown that non-antibiotic methods, such as essential oils in citrus, reduce foodborne pathogens found in the gut of animals; that phytochemicals—natural chemicals found in such plants as safflower, plums and peppers—enhance the immune system of chickens; and that certain natural compounds kill foodborne pathogens like Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7. Other research breakthroughs include creating new, effective antimicrobials and vaccines to fight such pathogens as Salmonella and Campylobacter to lower their incidence in chickens and turkeys and help keep consumers healthy. Finding alternatives to antibiotics has become a global issue as the demand for animal food products increases to meet the nutritional needs of a growing population. ARS scientists continue to seek solutions by developing new methods to control and prevent animal diseases and reduce bacterial pathogens in our food supply. ARS scientists are studying a variety of techniques to ensure our food supply remains safe. Photo by Peggy Greb.

"Montana Range Riding Aids Ranchers, Mitigates Conflicts  As silvery moonlight washed across the Montana meadow, it sent long shadows over the grass. Tonight, I didn’t need the gentle clang of the grazing bell to tell me where the horses were feeding. My leggy quarter horse was as brightly silver-white as the full moon. The distant lowing of cows across the meadow confirmed that all was well. Somewhere in the distance, a wolf pack was probably making evening rounds, but tonight they likely wouldn’t visit this meadow.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Initiatives  May 14,   Many children believe their food comes from the grocery store. But a class of 23 Mississippi second-graders knows better than that – the delicious food they love starts with a seed. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People’s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary visited a new People’s Garden at an office of USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and planted seeds of squash, watermelon, pumpkin, cucumber and, of course, the “Abraham Lincoln” tomato. Earth Team volunteers joined employees from NRCS’ Science and Technology Center to teach the youngsters about growing fruits and vegetables and the history of USDA. They learned of USDA’s upcoming 150th anniversary and its origins with President Lincoln. The People’s Garden effort started three years ago, and this central Mississippi garden is one of more than 1,500 People’s Gardens across the nation. The garden’s star plant is the “Abraham Lincoln” tomato, an heirloom variety first introduced in by the W.H. Buckbee seed company. Not only did they have a chance to get their hands dirty, but they had a party and sang “Happy Birthday” to USDA while enjoying a pumpkin cupcake. Students from Madison Avenue Elementary plant a People’s Garden in Mississippi in honor of the upcoming 150th anniversary of USDA. It would not be a party without conservation mascot Sammy Soil, who made a special appearance. Students also enjoyed meeting the garden’s guard – a scarecrow made from farmers’ clothes and recycled grocery bags. Nancy Magee, an NRCS program expert, organized the event and sees the plantings as a great way to connect students to the origin of food and explain the role farmers play in their lives. The garden is nearby Strawberry Park, a city green space with a busy walking trail. Magee said the garden’s location informs passersby about USDA and the People’s Garden. Plus, it is a beautiful asset to the office, she said. As children were boarding the school bus, after their visit to the new garden, she heard one student tell another, “I’m going to come back in a week and see how they’re growing.” That is exactly what Magee wanted to hear.

"Research Microbiologist, Agricultural Research Service, National Animal Disease Center in  Animals  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Nov 20,  ARS remains committed to conducting research to our overall understanding of antimicrobial resistance in swine pathogens. This week is World Antibiotic Awareness Week and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) remains committed to using a “One Health” approach in conducting research that will identify solutions to help prolong the usefulness of a very precious resource—antibiotics. For example, ARS research includes understanding how common production practices might impact antimicrobial resistance and understanding whether certain animal pathogens may be a public health concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is one bacteria type that is a public health concern because of its resistance to some antibiotics which can make it difficult to treat. MRSA has been found in livestock – mainly in swine. One particular MRSA strain, called ST5, has raised additional public health concerns because it is a major cause of human infections globally. To address these public health concerns, ARS conducted research to determine whether production practices like using in-feed zinc as an antidiarrheal agent contribute to the emergence and spread of MRSA in U.S. swine populations, and if ST5 bacterial isolates from swine and from humans are genetically related. ARS demonstrated that applying zinc in feed does not play a role in the prevalence of livestock-associated MRSA ST5 in the U.S. swine population. More importantly, ARS found that ST5 isolates from agricultural sources are genetically distinct and separate from clinical MRSA ST5 isolates obtained from human clinical settings. Specifically, isolates from agricultural sources were found to be extremely similar to each other within farms and lacked genes typically carried by human isolates. Collectively, ARS indicate that livestock-associated MRSA and clinical MRSA ST5 isolates are genetically distinct and transmission and/or genetic exchange between them is not currently occurring based on the findings in this study. ARS researchers are continuing to build on these results to further determine the distribution and impact of livestock-associated-MRSA ST5 outside of the livestock setting. As we celebrate World Antibiotic Awareness Week, we remain committed to a “One-Health” approach to prevent, not just react to, complex public and animal health issues. The information gained from these studies is important to our overall understanding of animal pathogens, and any potential risks to public health.

"Media Relations Officer, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 17,  According to the World Wildlife Fund, the American Pika (Ochotona princeps) could be the first mammal victim of climate change (US Forest Service Photo). In Scanning the Conservation Horizon, a report published by the National Wildlife Federation, with support from the U.S. Forest Service and other partners, scientists describe climate change as an increasing threat to species and ecosystems.  Addressing this threat requires the right answers, which can only come from asking the right questions. Through extensive research, U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists have developed a 22-question measurement tool called a System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species.  The tool will help land managers gauge the impact of climate change on land animals and make decisions about protecting threatened species.  Questions evaluate projected changes to animal habitats, physical functions, major life cycle events and interactions with other animal species, and their potential to cope with those changes. Users must chose from three answers associated with each question, which will identify traits and issues related to animal vulnerabilities. One question, for example, asks, “Are specific habitat components for breeding expected to change within the associated vegetation type?”  To determine vulnerability, users of the tool must answer if the breeding habitat components are expected to increase, decrease or be unchanged. Assuming climate change projections are correct, users then will note whether the information available is “adequate” or “inadequate” to assign a score for each question.  If the information is sufficient, an overall score will be assigned, representing the species’ relative vulnerability to climate change. The tool focuses solely on the effects of climate change on land animals. Scores can be used to rank at-risk animal species and identify vulnerability “hot spots” within large landscapes, such as national forests. “This tool doesn’t provide a definitive answer about the extent climate change will affect animal species,” said Deborah Finch, program manager of the Grassland, Shrubland and Desert Ecosystems Science unit of the Rocky Mountain Research Station, “but information is power, and we’re empowering land managers to start assessing vulnerabilities and making decisions about where to direct their limited resources.” Finch, along with Megan Friggens and Karen Bagne, both Rocky Mountain Research Station researchers, developed the questions. They say that users should rely on information gathered from published materials, expert consultation and personal knowledge to complete the questionnaire. A full report of the System for Assessing Vulnerability of Species is available at here.

"USDA Farm to School Regional Lead for the Mountain Plains Region and Helen Dombalis, Programs Director and Interim Policy Director for the National Farm to School Network in  Initiatives  Food and Nutrition  Nov 18,  Lunch at a Weld County School District 6 elementary school featuring local products: grass-finished beef, pinto beans, local certified organic apples and greenhouse tomatoes & cucumbers A bin of acorn squash sits on a pallet at the Weld County School District 6 central kitchen, right next to a bin of yellow onions and a 1,000 pound tote of russet potatoes – all locally-grown. A walk through the facility is enough to convince anyone that Weld County School District 6 is committed to scratch-cooked, locally-grown food for its 22,000 students at 35 schools.  In this rural Colorado school district, where over 40 languages are spoken at home and 66 percent of students are eligible for free or reduced price meals, fresh, tasty food is the norm – even down to the green chili, a southwestern favorite roasted in-house, using three varieties of local peppers. About a quarter of the central kitchen is dedicated to processing fresh fruits and vegetables.  Mushrooms are sliced, carrots are shredded and onions are diced. With funding from a USDA Farm to School Grant in , this food hub portion of the kitchen was furnished with tables, wash stations and equipment to process local food for Weld County’s own meals and for other districts in the area. Locally-grown acorn squash and onions stored in the central kitchen for a harvest lunch in November Natalie Leffler is the Food Hub Manager at Weld County School District 6. Her job is to coordinate partnerships with farmers, ranchers and local businesses to source as much local food as possible, defined as grown or produced within a 400 mile radius. Leffler manages an annual procurement to establish relationships and contracts. Growers must submit a food safety checklist with their bid documents, which she confirms with an in-person site visit, so the district can rest-assured that the local products are safe.  Matt Poling, the school district’s Executive Chef, ensures that menu planning, recipe development and production processes maximize the use of local products. The freezer is full of shredded local zucchini (for blending into tomato sauce), mirepoix (the age-old combination of onion, celery, and carrots used as a base for soups) and other local ingredients to incorporate into meals in the off-season.  The team even prepares mashed potatoes made with local red potatoes and home-made gravy. Locally-grown and dried pinto beans are sorted and cooked into refried beans or chili.  Just outside the facility are four giant compost bins designed to turn food scraps from the kitchen into compost for the district’s school gardens, funded through an innovative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District.  Sometimes El Fuego, the district’s flashy food truck, is parked outside, too. But typically the truck is out roaming the district, serving up favorites like barbacoa street tacos and yakisoba noodle bowls to students and school staff. Four compost bins, funded through a creative partnership with the West Greeley Conservation District, turn food scraps from the central kitchen into compost for school gardens The district goes beyond buying local food – school gardens, student wellness and food education are three major areas of focus. Plans are underway to transform a sandy, unused portion of a nearby schoolyard into an educational farm focused on student engagement and employment.  Called “Growing Grounds,” the project vision includes raised beds, an orchard, a teaching kitchen, hoop houses and a greenhouse.

Leveraging a Farmers Market Promotion Program grant, Foodworks established a new Wednesday evening farmers market to increase access to locally produced food in the Columbia Heights neighborhood. The program included “Bonus Bucks” to give shoppers who use Federal food benefits (SNAP, WIC, Senior FMNP) more purchasing power. The grant also helped Foodworks to develop a mixed-income CSA program – a weekly share from the market’s producers with options for individual or family-sized shares or a subsidized family-sized share for SNAP customers. The new market had a real impact on the community: Over half of the customers reported eating more vegetables since the market opened  A majority of market visitors reported the Bonus Bucks program was the main reason they shopped at the market  Most customers agreed that spending their benefits at the market was easy  In addition to their farmers market efforts, Foodworks offers other creative programs to help support the community.  In partnership with another local social service organization, Foodworks is able to provide fresh, local food home delivery services for seniors. They serve as a site for USDA summer meals, distributing 3-4 dozen snacks to hungry children at their two weekday markets. They also offer community educational classes on nutrition, obesity, and diabetes intervention. In the fall of , Foodworks piloted a new Veterans Vegetable Prescription Program to distribute weekly fruit and vegetable vouchers to eligible Veterans, seeing a redemption rate of 42 percent. These are great innovations and partnerships leveraged by Foodworks.  As we continue to support the marketing and distribution of locally produced foods for U.S. farmers and ranchers, we look to see more impacts resulting from our investments.  Under this Administration, USDA has invested more than $1 billion in over 40,000 local and regional food businesses and infrastructure projects. These activities contribute to USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food (KYF2) initiative, which coordinates efforts across USDA. Our recently-revamped website provides USDA resources for every point in the local food supply chain, including grants, loans, and other instructional guides.  Additionally, the KYF2 Compass maps local and regional food system investments across the country. More information on how USDA investments are connecting producers with consumers and expanding rural economic opportunities is available in Chapter IV of USDA Results on Medium. “The growth of Community Foodworks and our essential programs couldn't be possible without opportunities like the Farmers Market Promotion Program from AMS,” said Nick Stavely, Community Foodworks Farmers Market & Incentives Program Manager. “We're thankful for the role that the AMS grants played in the organization's expansion and program development.” Photo of Columbia Heights Farmers Market courtesy Mr T in DC.

"Forest Service Research & Development in  Conservation  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 03,  Kellie Carim, eDNA coordinator for the Genomics Center, collects and processes samples. (Photos by Michael Schwartz (left) and Katie Zarn, U.S. Forest Service) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research profile. The U.S. Forest Service has a long history as a leader in conservation genetics, and this recently took an exciting step forward with the launch of the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation. The Forest Service’s wildlife genetics lab, which has been central to the Rocky Mountain Research Station’s conservation genetics program since , has been reorganized and renamed to better reflect the scope of its work nationwide. The Center is a leading edge facility for advanced genomics research, nationally recognized, and works extensively with states, tribes, universities and private groups to address the management issues of over 60 fish and wildlife species.  collected by the Center will support the new Forest Service Forest Planning Rule with timely and cost-effective information on wildlife and fish species. Information developed by the Center will be made available through the network of USDA Climate Hubs to assist private forestland managers, farmers and ranchers in reaching their conservation goals. With state-of-the-art technology and the development of new tools and techniques, the main objective of the Center is to provide cost-effective and reliable genomic for improved species monitoring. By having more robust information, state and federal managers are better able to evaluate the genetic health and population viability of fish and wildlife species across the landscape. The discovery of a new fish species and the detection of invasive species are among the Center’s many contributions to the advancement of science and management. Imagine an expansive landscape, filled with different and remote terrain, and being asked to determine if the area has been impacted by a new invasive species. This is a daunting challenge that land managers face on a regular basis. One of the Center’s specialties, analyzing samples of environmental DNA, or eDNA, shows great promise in addressing this challenge. This type of DNA has been separated from organisms into the surrounding environment and can be found in soil, water and air. Forest Service scientists are developing ways to determine what species are present by simply sampling a cup of water from locations across the landscape. “eDNA is a highly sensitive method for detecting organisms in low abundance and is generally faster and extremely cost effective compared to traditional methods used to detect exotic or endangered species,” said Dr. Michael Schwartz, director of the center. The use of eDNA is an innovative approach to inventorying and monitoring fish and wildlife species. eDNA is particularly effective for detecting rare species that can be difficult to sample using traditional methods. For example, researchers at the Rocky Mountain Research Station have been working with partners and collaborators on the threatened bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) since . Bull trout is a culturally significant species to several Tribes in the Northwest and Columbia River Basin. It is also a prized game fish, and land management and recreational angling are significantly influenced by whether or not this species is present in a given watershed. This species is particularly sensitive to changes in habitat and is also threatened by the introduction of the nonnative brook trout (S. fontinalis). Forest Service scientists have developed sampling methods to make eDNA surveys a reliable and accessible option for managers to detect the presence of bull trout and their invasive competitor, brook trout. Forest Service scientists continue to develop eDNA techniques for detecting priority fish and wildlife.  eDNA is just one method of non-invasive genetic sampling, which uses forensic-style DNA samples to monitor rare and sensitive species, employed by the Center.

"Research and Development, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Apr 01,  Cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). (Emily Harrington/E.H. Illustration) U.S. Forest Service scientists at the Rocky Mountain Research Station in Missoula, Mont., have identified a new species of fish—the cedar sculpin (Cottus schitsuumsh). Although thousands of new species are described by scientists each year, only a small percentage of them are animal species, and even fewer are found in the United States, underscoring the importance of this discovery. Freshwater sculpins, with their characteristic large heads and fins, are bottom dwellers that can be found in cold, fast-moving streams throughout North America. Biologists have long suspected that there were undescribed species of sculpins in the Upper Columbia River Basin, but lacked the tools to recognize them. Cedar sculpin populations were previously thought to be shorthead sculpin (Cottus confusus), an understandable misidentification given that sculpins are notoriously difficult to identify based on their physical features. “Through our collaboration with the University of Montana, we uncovered morphological and genetic evidence demonstrating that two species have been masquerading under a single name for over 50 years,” said Michael Young, a Forest Service research fisheries biologist. The new species of sculpin was discovered in the Coeur d’Alene and St. Joe River basins in Idaho and part of the Clark Fork River Basin in Montana. In naming the species, the scientists consulted with elders of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe, whose historical homeland overlaps with the current range of this fish.  The scientific name for the species, Cottus schitsuumsh, is derived from the name for the Tribe, Schitsu’umsh, which means “those who were found here.” The common name refers to the western redcedar, a tree often found along streams in this region. While not commercially valuable in and of themselves, sculpins are well-known to anglers as a food source for big trout—a famous fly pattern, the muddler minnow, is designed to resemble a sculpin—and as indicators of water quality. The cedar sculpin is abundant in tributaries that also support westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. Forest Service scientists and their partners believe that much hidden diversity remains among sculpin populations throughout the Western U.S., with additional species waiting to be identified. They are dedicated to helping unravel these mysteries in order to conserve and sustainably manage our natural resources. Top, side and bottom view of a male cedar sculpin.

"Tree Rings Tell the History of Fire and Forest Health  Why are Rocky Mountain Research Station scientists sampling tree rings in the Pinaleño Mountains of southeast Arizona? Because tree ring samples reveal the history of fire. When fire scorches a tree, the tree floods its wound with sap, which protects the wound from wood rot decay for hundreds of years, as long as fires keep burning at a low intensity.  Diane Banegas, Research and Development, USDA Forest Service  Posted in  Forestry  Apr 12,   Respond to this story",What role do tree rings play in recording the history of fire events in the Pinaleño Mountains?,Tree rings record the history of fire events by preserving information about when fires occurred and burned at low intensities.
"After the Fire - Wood Waste Put to Work  Biochar, or wood waste, is a porous carbon substance that results from burning wood in the absence of oxygen. It is typically created when burning chunks of wood are covered by ash, soil or a lid, which insulates the coals and starves them of oxygen. This fire remnant provides a valuable addition to soil for agriculture and gardening purposes as well as contributing to overall forest health.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Nov 18,  NRCS provided technical assistance to the Choctaws in the creation of Lake Pushmataha, a 285-acre lake in Neshoba County. November is American Indian Heritage Month and offers a great time to recognize the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians for their stellar record as stewards of the environment. The tribe knows the value of land. That’s why it is working with USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to improve wildlife habitat in its communities across the state. The Choctaws have used NRCS’ Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) to improve 860 acres in Carroll County on their property Malmasion this year. Malmasion is the site of a plantation that was built among Choctaw hunting grounds. The plantation burned in the s, and the Choctaws purchased the land in . The tribe, through its director of natural resources, Jason Grisham, is implementing wildlife conservation practices that enhance and restore habitat for wildlife. While habitat has improved for deer, this land also provides refuge for other native animals, including turkeys, squirrels and songbirds. Since the tribe started working with NRCS, oak trees are dropping ample acorns, a favorite food of deer and other wildlife. Tribal members are also taking down bigger bucks—many with traditional bows. A big part of wildlife management is the use of prescribed burning for habitat diversity. This practice is not only used by NRCS conservationists, but is also a method the Choctaws have used for hundreds of years and are currently using to enhance this land. Forest management is a big part of Jason Grisham’s (right) duties. Choctaws use the firewood for heat during the winter, but the bulk of it is used during funeral services, where a perpetual fire must be maintained for three days. NRCS tribal liaison Tim Oakes has worked with the tribe’s forestry department on managing the forests, providing technical assistance on thinning. As the habitat matures, the Choctaws cut trees to provide firewood. It is tribal custom to use firewood during funeral services, where a fire is kept burning for three days. The Choctaws are able to meet the demand through proper forest management. NRCS has also teamed up with the Choctaws in an educational project called “Wetland Discovery.” This 600-foot boardwalk meanders through a wetland constructed with WHIP funds. The elevated walkway has signs in written in English and Choctaw describing the native species of plants and animals. Grisham said Tribal leaders have recognized the benefits of working with NRCS in recent years, and that future partnerships are on the horizon. The Choctaws use this area to hold cultural education events to teach children about their traditions and history.

"Posted by Fátima Terry, Deputy Director, USDA Digital Service in  Technology  Aug 12,  The seeds of digital transformation are taking root as application reviews for our agency’s first Digital Service (DS) Fellows cohort are in progress. By establishing a dedicated fellow team at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), we will be able to improve access to USDA resources and programs across the country. Once onboarded this fall, our USDA Digital Service (DS) Fellows will work to accelerate the design, development, and delivery of customer-centric services. To gain insight on digital service best practices, we hosted the U.S. Digital Service (USDS) team at our headquarters in Washington, D.C. last month. Digital Service staff from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and other agencies shared their experience with USDS, how they are addressing current challenges, and what the future of digital services at their agencies looks like. “We are so appreciative of the great collaboration and partnership with USDS as we work to shape a Digital Service team here at USDA, and we learned a lot about how we can continue to drive this great work here across the many mission areas and missions of USDA,” said Arianne Gallagher-Welcher, Executive Director of the USDA Digital Service and Co-Founder of the Presidential Innovation Fellows Program. USDA has seen firsthand the difference digital service can make. As the People’s Department, one of our most important missions is ensuring access to nutritious and safe food. Many of our nation’s youngest children were affected when a manufacturer product recall and weakened supply chains caused an infant formula shortage in . This particularly impacted USDA customers, as families who use our Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program) buy 56% of all the formula sold in America. With other federal partners, USDA teamed up with the USDS to develop and analyze real-time about the amount of formula available in any given U.S. location. As a result, 388 million bottles of infant formula were imported and deployed to the places that needed it most based on new and analytics. This is just one example of how digital service can deliver solutions for the federal government’s most challenging technology implementation problems. You can learn more about this and other USDS solutions in their Impact Report. Our collaborative partnership with USDS is essential as our new Digital Service team launches.

"Acting National Coordinator for USDA Climate Hubs, Office of Energy and Environmental Policy in  Climate  Farming  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 08,  In June , Secretary Vilsack outlined a vision for agricultural solutions to environmental challenges, which included creating the Regional Climate Hubs. In , the USDA Climate Hubs were established in to serve as regional centers of climate change information and outreach to reduce risks. The Climate Hubs enhance USDA capacity to deliver science-based knowledge and practical information to support climate-informed decision making on farms, ranches, and forests. Early career professionals joined the Hubs to hone their science communication and engagement skills while supporting the Climate Hubs’ mission. In , Climate Hub Fellows focused on co-developing science-based information to help land managers make climate-informed decisions. Likewise, Hubs brought on interns and post-doctoral researchers. Climate Hubs were able to enhance engagements among land managers and scientists to co-develop science and technology. To mark the 10-year anniversary of Secretary Vilsack sharing his vision for the Climate Hubs, we share two highlights. Dr. Julian Reyes was a Climate Hub Fellow with the Southwest Climate Hub. During his fellowship, he developed, AgRisk Viewer, which empowers decision makers to assess their climate risks by commodity type at the county scale using long-term crop insurance from Risk Management Agency. This tool identifies areas of agricultural production risk due to extreme events to help target locations for adaptation actions. Haley Case-Scott was a Resource Assistance Program intern with the Northwest Climate Hub. During Haley’s internship, she engaged with Tribal Nations supporting government-to-government consultation for the 25th update to the Northwest Forest Plan. Haley also developed communication materials to share information about USDA programs that could support climate adaptation and mitigation. Both Reyes and Case-Scott have also worked with the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy (OSTP) to provide clear, useful, and useable science and knowledge to inform the Administration’s climate, environment, and nature actions and initiatives. “Communities and decision makers need actionable and usable climate information and services. My time with the USDA Climate Hubs has shown the power of co-production ensuring community voices are embedded in our place-based, people-centered work. These perspectives have also helped me in my work at OSTP,” Reyes said. “Serving as a Resource Assistant Program intern with the USDA Northwest Climate Hub was a great experience. It allowed me to take a deep dive into how the federal government works, and provided me the tools needed to build my professional career,” Case-Scott said.

"Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service’s Livestock and Poultry Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 15,  USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Purdue University have developed a series of training videos that illustrate proper sanitation assessment techniques to evaluate shell egg processing equipment. While the practices in these videos are in facilities that have USDA grading, they are valuable for any shell egg facility wishing to learn more about good sanitation techniques. To support emerging needs across the egg industry in recent years, AMS reviewed its internal procedures to assess equipment sanitation in shell egg processing plants. The agency visited over 30 shell egg processing facilities across the country to assess equipment sanitation and consistency. In order to document and share findings, AMS partnered with Purdue and ARS to develop this educational video series. The videos take the viewer through each phase of shell egg processing and explain how to inspect each component of the facility for sanitation effectiveness. The 18 videos are a great resource for shell egg processing facilities by illustrating what clean machines and facilities should look like prior to daily verification by USDA grading personnel. Originally released in English, these videos have now been translated into Spanish due to industry demand. The full series of videos can be found on Purdue University Extension’s YouTube channel at: Egg Processing & Production Videos - YouTube.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Dec 01,  There are only a few things in life that can bring together and excite a global community, and food and sports are two of those things! USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) is tapping into these uniting experiences by shining a spotlight on high-quality, safe, delicious, and sustainably produced U.S. foods during the FIFA World Cup, underway in Qatar. This groundbreaking effort, organized by FAS’s Office of Agricultural Affairs in Dubai and the U.S. Embassy in Qatar, is introducing nearly 130,000 visitors per day to the great variety and quality of U.S. foods at the USA Pavilion. Located in the heart of Doha, in a fan zone featuring international pavilions, visitors to the USA Pavilion feel as though they’re being transported to the States through the sights, sounds, and smells of everything U.S. agriculture has to offer – including food/ag, education, and tourism. “It’s our mission at the World Cup to introduce the world to our true MVPs, America’s farmers and ranchers who work every day to grow and produce safe, nutritious, sustainable, and delicious foods and ingredients to feed and nourish the world,” said USDA Agricultural Counselor Valerie Brown. “We’ve put together a dream team of U.S. food and commodity groups and celebrity chefs who are looking to score new fans as they kick things up with cooking demonstrations, competitions, and giveaways featuring U.S. ingredients – everything from healthy treats for athletes to decadent game day foods for fans and families. Whether visitors want to learn how to make nutritious snacks with U.S. fruits, nuts, and cheese, or something more indulgent like barbeque, gumbo, and ice cream desserts, the USA Pavilion will offer food lovers from around the world a field of options – all thanks to America’s farmers and ranchers.” According to the latest trade , U.S. food and agricultural exports to the world, and the Middle East in particular, increased last fiscal year (). In , U.S. farmers and ranchers exported a record $196.4 billion of food and agricultural products to the world, of which $6.6 billion was exported to the Middle East, up 20 percent from the prior year. Consumer demand for U.S. foods and ingredients is growing in the region, especially for U.S. tree nuts, dairy products, and beef and beef products, a few of the many ingredients being showcased at the World Cup USA Pavilion in Qatar. “This year the World Cup may be more than 7,ates, but FAS is proudly representing Team USA and our food and ag MVPs back home,” added Brown. “Visitors to the USA Pavilion will travel on a food and ag tour across our wonderful country as their senses discover ingredients and products from Virginia and Louisiana, to Texas, California, Hawaii, and other amazing states in between.

"USDA Food Loss and Waste Liaison in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Jun 15,  In the United States, more than one-third of all available food goes uneaten through loss or waste and when landfilled it contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. On May 26, , the U.S. Department of Agriculture hosted our first ever USDA Food Loss and Waste Innovation Fair. This free, virtual fair highlighted businesses that are creating or implementing state-of-the-art technical solutions to reduce food loss and waste throughout the food system – from farm to table – and highlighted USDA activities in this space. Three categories of booth holders showcased their food loss and waste activities, products, and innovations. First, the fair highlighted U.S. Food Loss and Waste Champions. In addition to reducing food waste in their operations, several of these food industry leaders — e.g., Sprouts Farmers Market, Sodexo, and MGM Resorts International — committed to fighting hunger by donating safe, excess food to charitable organizations. Secondly, the fair also gave a platform for USDA agencies to share their work on food loss and waste (e.g., research, funding, measurement, outreach). As one example, the joint booth by USDA Foreign Agriculture Service and Feed the Future has information on the U.S. Government’s initiative to simultaneously combat global hunger and food loss and waste. Third, the fair featured USDA-funded organizations that are developing or marketing food loss and waste reducing technologies. Among the innovations was Full Cycle Bioplastics’ patented technology, which makes a compostable bioplastic from organic waste that can help address three global problems at once — reducing food waste, climate change, and plastic pollution. Nearly 850 people attended the live event. Most of the USDA Food Loss and Waste Innovation Fair and materials will be available for a full year so feel free to register today, visit the booths, and download materials on demand.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food Safety Education Staff in  Health and Safety  Jul 01,  This Fourth of July, join the revolution against foodborne illness. Summer’s rising temperatures make picnics a playground for bacteria as families prepare, cook, and eat food outside. Here are some tips to keep you safe: Pledge Allegiance to Cleanliness Wash your hands before and after you handle food:  Wet your hands with clean, running water, turn off the tap and apply soap.  Lather your hands by rubbing them together with soap. Lather the backs of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails.  Scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds.  Rinse your hands well under clean, running water.  Dry your hands using a clean towel. Don’t have access to a faucet? Carry bottled water, soap, paper towels, hand sanitizer or disposable moist towelettes that contain at least 60 percent alcohol. Use Red, White and Blue Cutting Boards Avoid cross contamination by using separate, different colored cutting boards — one for fresh fruits and vegetables, one for cheeses, and another for raw meats. Spark Up that Grill If you’re grilling at your picnic, remember to cook raw meat and poultry to a safe minimum internal temperature: ground meats at 160 F, whole cuts of meat at 145 F with a three-minute rest time, and poultry at 165 F. Land of the Free-zer Pack coolers with bags of ice, gel packs or even frozen water bottles to store your food. Use an appliance thermometer in your cooler to monitor that your food stays chilled at 40 F or below. For more information about food safety, contact the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline to talk to a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

"University of Georgia, Associate Professor in  Research and Science  Dec 09,  Carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation sector constitute 2.5 percent of global emissions. One way to reduce this carbon footprint is to replace conventional aviation fuel (obtained by refining crude oil) with aviation fuel derived from sustainably produced biomass feedstocks. Carinata (Brassica Carinata), also known as Ethiopian mustard, is an oilseed crop that can be grown across the southern U.S. during winter months. The oil obtained from crushed carinata seeds can be refined to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This could reduce up to 68 percent of carbon emissions compared to a unit of conventional aviation fuel in the U.S. based on the findings of a USDA-National Institute of Fooda and Agriculture funded study recently published in the journal Global Change Biology Bioenergy by Dr. Puneet Dwivedi, Asiful Alam and Farhad Masum. Carinata does not compete with traditional summer crops grown in the region and could potentially provide additional income opportunities to farmers. It improves water quality, prevents soil erosion, and supports soil health. Since it is a non-food crop, carinata-based SAF also avoids the food-versus-fuel debate. The residues after crushing carinata are high in protein and can be used as animal feed. Refining carinata oil produces other valuable bioproducts such as renewable diesel and naphtha. Currently, producing carinata-based SAF costs more than conventional aviation fuel. As part of coordinated efforts to advance sustainable avial fuel, the Biden Administration proposed tax credits for SAF production meet 100 percent of aviation fuel demand by . This incentive could potentially attract investors to establish the necessary supply chain for carinata-based SAF in the southern United States, which could drive demand for the crop and inspire farmers to grow carinata in the region.

"Strategic Communications Coordinator, FPAC Business Center in  Conservation  Jan 05,  USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides extensive on the Nation’s conservation program activities through its RCA Viewer. And now, visualizations have been added to the tool, making the easier to interpret, sort, and download. Users can now graph, map, and download customized datasets that include information on acres receiving conservation, practices applied, land use, cropland soil erosion, and prime farmland. The tool also links to the full set of standard (tabular) RCA , which will continue to be available. Users can also link to research on the effect of conservation practices, including those from the Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP), a multi-agency effort to quantify the environmental effects of conservation practices and programs and show the results of our conservation dollars spent. The RCA Viewer is named after the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act (RCA) of that gives the USDA the authority, among other things, to appraise the status and trends of soil, water, and related resources on non-Federal land. Other recent updates include on practice enhancements and bundles supported by the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and soil health performance measures. Two cropland soil health performance measures were added. The Cropland Soil Health and Sustainability measure identifies land units where at least two practices are applied to improve soil health during a single year. Practices include crop rotation, no-till, reduced till, cover crops, and CSP enhancements and bundles. The Cropland Soil Health Management System measure identifies areas where a group of conservation practices and enhancements (or bundles) are applied that address four basic soil health principles: minimize disturbance, maximize soil cover, maximize biodiversity, and maximize the presence of living roots. These updates, and now the addition of visualizations, show how NRCS is continually striving to improve the RCA Viewer to make it more valuable and easier to use.

"MS, RDN, Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Oct 05,  Like many of our USDA colleagues across the country, federal staff from the Food and Nutrition Service were glued in last week to the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. Many attended in-person to contribute ideas and host the event alongside White House staff, and hundreds more tuned in virtually. It was a day to remember, filled with excitement and a renewed commitment to the important work our agency does to improve food and nutrition security. The conference and related national strategy (, 776 ) offer an important opportunity to acknowledge FNS’ role in reducing hunger, increasing healthy eating and mitigating health disparities. Our new report, “Leveraging the White House Conference to Promote and Elevate Nutrition Security: The Role of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service,” highlights the many ways FNS will continue to make strides toward the bold goals set during the conference. As Secretary Vilsack said in his opening remarks, “Something like this hasn’t happened in more than 50 years. Let’s keep the momentum of today going in a new and meaningful, strong way so we can fully meet this important moment—for our children, for our community, and for our country.” Here’s what FNS staff had to say about the event and what lies ahead:  “It was such an inspirational day—I was struck by the energy and excitement at the conference and the enthusiasm from the attendees to work together to meet the conference goals.” – Jackie Haven, deputy administrator, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion  “I was excited to hear medical professionals stating emphatically the connection between nutritious food and overall health. I felt such pride to be part of the great mission of FNS while listening as speakers shared their personal experiences with food insecurity, the support provided by our programs and their desire to pay it forward.” – Dr. Patty Bennett, Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator  “Engaging with diverse, forward-thinking individuals across various sectors of government, academia, and non-profit organizations, while listening to folks willing to share their lived experiences mirrors the all-hands-on-deck approach needed to provide nutritious food for all and eliminate diet-related diseases.” – Justice Wright, senior technical advisor, Office of Policy Support  “The conference provided such a great opportunity to reflect on what we have accomplished and look forward to what still can be done. I was inspired by the overwhelming commitment and energy from all the speakers and excited to hear throughout the conference that FNS programs are so much a part of the solutions.” – Tim English, associate administrator, Regional Operations and Support  “It was an honor to participate and represent the FNS SNAP team at this historic event. My role as notetaker for pillar 3 and facilitator for a small group session enabled me to engage with conference participants and speakers in a positive way to support the vision to end hunger by .” – Laura Griffin, senior policy advisor, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  “As Chef José Andrés said, school meals are the ‘Trojan horse of goodness!’ I’m looking forward to using my opportunity as a presidential management fellow to work across FNS and other agencies to devise creative and equitable ways to extend nutrition education and food access between the school lunch table and the family dining table.” – Stacey Viera, program analyst and presidential management fellow, Office of Child Nutrition Programs  “I appreciated seeing the broad range of individuals who participated in the conference, particularly the young people. I am excited to see what substantive changes are inspired by the conference and proud to support the goals of ending hunger and improving health outcomes. This is a really exciting time to work for FNS!” – Alexei Schnakenburg, program analyst, Western Regional Office  “It was such a powerful and motivating conference and for the sake of our generation and those to come, let’s keep the momentum going!” – David Herring, nutritionist, Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion  “This event was a great reminder that FNS and its partners do so much more than provide food—they connect people to their communities, provide nutrition security and empower the most vulnerable to make healthy choices that not only impact themselves, but generations after them.” – Katey Yoast, lead analyst, Mid-Atlantic Regional Office  “During the conference, I felt inspired and motivated. The potential for both intragovernmental and public-private collaboration is exciting—and I am grateful to have a role in improving the lives of our fellow Americans.” – Patrick Farrell, WIC program specialist, Mid-Atlantic Regional Office  “It was a historic and life-changing day for all Americans, whether they realized it or not! I was particularly excited to hear this administration acknowledge the relationship between promoting healthy eating and reducing preventable diseases.” – Tiffany Reuss, WIC nutritionist, Southwest Regional Office  “Incredibly thankful that the administration held this summit to focus on the food security issues that continue to devastate our nation. This renewed focus will help continue the important work of eliminating hunger from our nation.” – Brian Solomon, SNAP E&T program analyst, Western Regional Office  “Ambassador Rice’s ending with national 4-H rock stars and having all the youth attendees stand up was a powerful ending to the day, ensuring youth voice is a part of all we do!” – Sheila Fleischhacker, special assistant for nutrition security  Category/Topic:  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Tags:  Food and Nutrition Service  FNS  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition  Equitable Systems  SNAP  White House Conference on Hunger Nutrition and Health  equity  You May Also Like  SNAP-Ed Connects Culture, Land, and Food  Healthier Foods, Healthier Minds  National Women’s History Month: Celebrating FNS’ Unsung Heroines","What are some ways in which the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will leverage the momentum from the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health to promote nutrition security and mitigate health disparities?","The Role of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service,"" FNS staff plan to continue making strides toward the bold goals set during the conference by: * Addressing food insecurity through programs such as SNAP * Increasing access to healthy food options, particularly for vulnerable populations * Supporting nutrition education and awareness efforts to promote healthy eating habits * Mitigating health disparities through targeted initiatives and partnerships These efforts aim to leverage the momentum from the White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health to promote nutrition security and mitigate health disparities."
"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service with guest author Alynn Sampson, Vice President, Operations & Impact, Food Bank of Lincoln in  Equity  Food and Nutrition  Initiatives  Nutrition Security  Feb 08,  The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP, Reach and Resiliency – Round 1 grants are making an impact in communities across the nation. At the Food Bank of Lincoln, we have been able to leverage Reach and Resiliency sub-grant funding awarded by our Nebraska TEFAP agency to identify underserved areas and to implement strategies to increase TEFAP access in those areas. In some cases, the strategies were as simple as increasing the frequency of deliveries to specific communities to ensure that existing TEFAP resources were being equitably distributed. During the first quarter of the grant, we implemented a 21% increase in deliveries to four identified underserved counties, which resulted in a 55% increase in TEFAP pounds of food distributed to those areas when compared to the previous year. As a result, TEFAP is now reaching more than 4,000 households in Butler, Fillmore, Otoe, and York counties. We also now have 12 food access points in those counties and three additional non-profit partners involved in TEFAP operations. A recent pantry partner gave their input regarding food access: “As food prices continue to rise, having the ability for increased deliveries to both of my rural food pantries is critical. The number of food pantry clients has doubled in the past few months, and I expect a steady increase. It is very difficult for clients to receive fresh produce in rural areas, and that is something that is always in need. To buy one head of lettuce now is almost $5 at our rural grocery stores, and 99% of our clients cannot afford something as simple as a head of lettuce with the price increases.” The TEFAP Reach and Resiliency Grant has provided support to the Food Bank of Lincoln as they deliver USDA TEFAP products more broadly to our neighbors in need. The grant has also expanded the use of to identify convenient delivery areas as well as ensure an increased focus on consistent access to USDA TEFAP products for communities.

"USDA-FSIS in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Feb 07,  The Super Bowl is the biggest and most anticipated sporting event of the year. Friends and families “huddle” and consume foods and snacks for the duration of the game while cheering for their favorite team. This iconic annual event is often celebrated by ordering takeout and delivered foods, which if left out too long, can cause foodborne illness. Leaving food out at room temperature is a big food safety penalty. Bacteria that can cause foodborne illness will start to grow to dangerous levels in the range of temperatures between 40 F and 140 F when left out for over two hours or one hour if above 90 F. This range of temperatures is called the Danger Zone. To avoid foodborne illness during the big game, follow this game plan:  Keep cold foods cold and hot foods hot. Cold foods should be kept under 40 F on the buffet table by nesting serving dishes of food in bowls of ice. Hot foods should be kept above 140 F. A preheated oven, chafing dishes, preheated warming trays or slow cookers can be used to keep food hot.  Don’t serve all food at once. Use small platters and replace them often with fresh refrigerated platters of food, rather than adding fresh food to a serving dish already on the table. Hot foods should be reheated to 165 F as measured with a food thermometer. When reheating in the microwave, cover the food for even heating. Check the temperature of the food in several places with a food thermometer, as some microwaved foods can have cold spots. For more information, call the USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-MPHotline or email MPHotline@usda.gov to reach a food safety expert or chat live at ask.usda.gov from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.

"Posted by Farm to School Specialist Allison Bell, Mountain Plains Regional Office, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  May 31,  Bringing together local producers and schools was the objective of the “Bringing the Farm to School” producer training in Hardin, Montana. The training sought to build relationships between schools and producers to increase the availability of local foods served to children. USDA Farm to School Specialists Andrea Alma and Alli Bell were on hand to demonstrate the many ways USDA’s Farm to School Program is connecting with schools and communities. Partners from Montana Team Nutrition and the Mission Mountain Food Enterprise Center brought the training curriculum to life, showing agricultural producers how to approach schools to sell their products and offering insight into procurement considerations, including the budgets, timing, and regulations faced by school food directors. Participants shared ideas on how to connect kids to more local foods. For example, two local ranchers drove more than five hours to the training, looking for strategies on approaching schools with their excess ground beef. Another attendee, trying to start a food hub, wanted to orient her business to sell food to schools. Another participant planned to start a mixed vegetable operation and wanted to incorporate farm to school in her business plan. The training included a tour of the Hardin School kitchen with Food Service Director Marlo Spreng and Hardin Farm to School Coordinator Elle Ross. They described the district’s journey to more scratch cooking and meals featuring traditional Crow dishes, since the school serves children from the Crow Reservation. The training also hosted a “Montana Foods for Montana Schools” connection event for school food service professionals to learn more about Farm to School and to meet farmers in their area. This innovative event covered it all - knowledge sharing, relationship building, and coming together over a meal. It was an outstanding networking and program improvement opportunity Mountain Plains Regional staff were proud to attend.

"National Agricultural Library, Ming Chan, National Agricultural Library, and Cheryl Porter, University of Florida in  Research and Science  Sep 08,  Crop researchers are hungry for to feed their crop models. There is a wealth of historical that’s inaccessible because today’s crop model software applications cannot easily interpret it. USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) is working with the University of Florida and the Agricultural Research Network (ARDN) to solve this problem. ARDN is dedicated to making high value datasets from past research and experiments compatible with crop models and other analytical tools. With support from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), NAL and the University of Florida are piloting a “hackathon” approach to make this old useful. Experts gather several times a year to create standardized vocabulary and extract relevant information to use in the AgMIP Crop Experiment schema (ACE) – a widely used format for agricultural models. As part of the NIFA grant, the team will annotate four datasets using ARDN protocols. The initial datasets include research from projects at Iowa State University, University of Georgia, the University of Arizona, and the Kellogg Biological Station. These annotated datasets will be available on NAL’s Ag Commons website. NAL also supports ARDN by hosting VMapper software on the Ag Commons website. VMapper creates a file which contains the “road map” for translating the original into the ACE format. ARDN’s collaborative efforts will save crop modelers time and give them access to much more historical , accelerating research and new discoveries.

"Public Affairs Specialist, FSIS, USDA in  Health and Safety  May 24,  At your next picnic, let the spotlight shine on your food — not on party crashers like Salmonella or Listeria. When temperatures rise and food safety steps aren’t followed, cold dishes at a cookout are at risk for unsafe bacteria levels. Avoid foodborne illness by following these steps: Clean: Remember to clean and sanitize all dishes and utensils used to make your salad and wash your hands before and after food prep. Separate: Use different cutting boards, plates and utensils to avoid spreading bacteria when preparing your raw foods and ready-to-eat cold dishes. Cook: Make sure the main meat or poultry ingredients used in cold salads (egg salad, chicken salad, etc.) are cooked to safe internal temperatures before mixing:  Cook eggs to 160 F.  Cook chicken to 165 F. Although most cold salads use mayonnaise, the danger of foodborne illness lies with the main ingredient, such as eggs or chicken. Make sure they are cooked and chilled at the proper temperature. If you use homemade mayonnaise, follow these . Chill: Avoid the Danger Zone (temperatures between 40 F and 140 F) by refrigerating perishable food within two hours — one hour if it’s a hot day (above 90 F). Keep cold foods at an internal temperature of 40 F or below by nestling food in ice or keeping food in a cooler.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Farm Production and Conservation Business Center in  Conservation  Jun 23,  FWC Photo by Andy Wraithmell, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Did you know the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil scientists are playing an important role in saving Florida’s manatees? These giant, but gentle, creatures are adored by residents and visitors to Florida. Unfortunately, though, their numbers have been threatened in recent years throughout the state. Manatees in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon (IRL), which stretches 156 miles along Florida’s eastern coast, have been starving to death at an alarming rate over the last two years. These deaths can be attributed to a lack of seagrass, their main source of food, which is being affected by algal blooms. As the algae blooms destroy seagrass beds, it causes sediment to float to the water’s surface. The water goes from clear to murky, making it harder for light to penetrate the water and provide sustenance to the seagrass. This creates a vicious cycle where more seagrass dies, more sunlight is blocked, and the manatees are left with less food to eat. NRCS is part of a team working to address the challenge, along with St. Johns River Water Management District, the University of Florida, among many other national and state agencies. The scientists go out on the IRL in pontoon boats and use sonar to conduct underwater soil surveys to gather information on the healthiest areas and the most degraded areas of the lagoon. The information is used to decide where to concentrate restoration efforts. This information has helped improve lagoons through actions like clams, oysters, and seagrass being deployed to aid in filtering and clearing the water. Scientists hope that continued improvement will eventually lead to the full restoration of manatees in the IRL.

"Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Research and Science  Trade  Jun 10,  Several hundred non-native forest insect species have become established in the U.S. Recent arrivals, such as this adult Asian longhorned beetle, have killed millions of trees and altered urban landscapes in the Northeast and Midwest. (U.S. Department of Agriculture/Kenneth R. Law, courtesy of Bugwood.org)  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Wood makes great packaging material—it’s inexpensive, abundant and versatile—but there’s one drawback: destructive forest pests stowaway in the pallets, crates and dunnage (wood used to brace cargo) used in international shipping. Over many years, international trade has resulted in the inadvertent introduction of many non-native wood-feeding pests and plant pathogens in the U.S. and throughout the world. Some of these non-native insects, including the emerald ash borer and the Asian longhorned beetle, have become highly invasive and caused serious environmental and economic impacts. But an international standard for wood packaging material is slowing the inadvertent export of invasive bark- and wood-boring insects, according to a study conducted by Robert Haack, a research entomologist with the Forest Service’s Northern Research Station in Lansing, Mich., and a team of scientists. Researchers found as much as a 52 percent drop in infestation rates in the U.S., where the standard was implemented in three phases between and . The study was published May 14 in the journal PLOS ONE. The International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15, or ISPM 15, is a set of standards developed by the International Plant Protection Convention stipulating how wood packaging material used in international trade should be treated before export. Treatments for eliminating live insects that may be contained in wood include heating wood, fumigating it and requiring the removal of bark from wood used for wood packaging material. As of October , more than 78 countries had implemented ISPM 15. Haack and co-authors of the study, including U.S. Department of Agriculture scientists Kerry Britton (now retired), Joseph F. Cavey and Lynn J. Garrett, believe that the drop in infestation rates would be even more dramatic if more had been collected prior to implementation of the standard. The best available in the U.S. only allowed researchers to compare wood packaging infestation rates from two years prior to U.S. implementation of the new international standard to infestation rates during the first four years after the standards were implemented. “The reduction in infestation rate would likely have been even higher if we had more years of that predated U.S. implementation of these international standards,” Haack said. “For example, based on infestation of wood packaging material entering New Zealand from the early s, when infestation rates were higher, ISPM 15 has achieved closer to a 97 percent reduction in the number of insect stowaways.” International wood packaging material is now treated to prevent stowaways like this Asian longhorned beetle larvae.

"Director, Grading and Standards Division of the Agricultural Marketing Service's Dairy Program in  Trade  Dec 01,  USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work to keep markets open to U.S. products. Recently, an interagency team resolved an issue with Morocco, keeping a $126 million market open for American butter, cheese and other dairy products. U.S. agricultural exports continue to be a bright spot for America’s economy, worth a record $152.5 billion in fiscal year .  That’s why USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and its sister agencies work so hard to keep these export markets open.  So in , when Morocco requested that USDA use a new dairy export certificate that we could not endorse, we launched into action.  Our goal was to protect an export market worth $126 million annually while preserving our close relationship with a valued trading partner. Morocco is the 13th largest export market for our dairy products, and U.S. dairy exports are the fastest growing export category to that country.  U.S. companies export many dairy commodities to Morocco, such as butter, cheese and skim milk powder, as well as dairy ingredients such as milk protein and whey protein products. However, in Morocco’s agricultural officials requested changes to the information provided on the dairy export certificates issued by the unit I direct, the Grading and Standards Division of within the AMS Dairy Program.  Most countries importing U.S. dairy products require these certificates, and issuing them is one of many services my Division provides to exporters to maintain and expand market access. As a stopgap measure, we began using a general dairy certificate to keep that market open.  But then, in April , following numerous detainments of U.S. dairy shipments, we learned that Morocco was considering stopping all U.S. dairy trade if we did not submit a specifically negotiated export certificate. Beginning in , the AMS Dairy Program worked closely with an existing interagency team of technical experts from AMS, USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to address the issue.  The team submitted a response to Morocco that addressed additives, animal health issues, microbiological criteria and thermal treatment processes, as well as a proposed AMS Sanitary Certificate for Exports for Milk and Milk Products for Human Consumption to Morocco that reflected all the suggested changes. On November 12, , we received the good news that the government of Morocco had accepted the proposed certificate—without further revision, concluding more than three years of negotiations.  The certificate’s acceptance means this important market will remain open to U.S. exports, paving the way for an even better year for the U.S. dairy industry. USDA and AMS are no strangers to keeping U.S. export markets open.  In , the same interagency team responded quickly to changes in China’s regulatory requirements for U.S. dairy exports.  Their work helped to secure a market worth $1 billion annually. We’re committed to keeping dairy and all other U.S. agricultural exports flowing.  By maintaining and expanding export markets, we help to strengthen our rural communities that produce the high-quality, American-grown products consumers worldwide desire.  And that’s good for everyone.

"Senior Trade Advisor, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Jun 20,  Driscoll’s berries being sold in a store (Photograph courtesy of Driscoll’s. Copyright . All rights reserved.) Two years ago this month, the United States and the European Union (EU) implemented an organic equivalence arrangement, meaning products that are certified as organic in the U.S. can also be sold as organic in the EU, and vice versa. This arrangement broke down many of the barriers that organic producers, especially small and medium-sized farmers, were facing in exporting their goods to one of their largest markets. It has also proved to be a good example of how we can recognize each others' systems and work together across borders to arrive at beneficial agreements. The U.S. and EU have some of the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and the organic equivalence arrangement recognizes these standards and uses them for everyone’s benefit. Before the agreement, growers and companies wanting to trade products on both sides of the Atlantic had to obtain separate certifications to two different standards, which meant a double set of fees, inspections, and paperwork. Now, if a product is certified organic by one party, it can bear both the USDA organic seal and the EU organic logo, without going through that second certification process. This is possible because the EU and the U.S. have recognized that though our regulatory systems are different, they both produce high quality organic food and agricultural products under rigorous programs. Secretary Vilsack, while addressing the EU agricultural ministers earlier this week, had the same message of cooperation in regards to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). “We also need to focus on reducing the impact of the differences in our regulatory and standard-setting systems. For companies on both sides of the Atlantic, this is perhaps the most promising – and challenging – area for cooperation in T-TIP,” Vilsack said. “The U.S. and the EU have the strongest regulatory protections in the world, and nothing we do through T-TIP will undermine this. But there are steps that can be taken to better align our regulatory and standard-setting processes by improving transparency, participation and accountability. The U.S.-EU organic equivalency agreement, which took effect two years ago this month, is a good example of how we can recognize each other’s systems and facilitate trade to the benefit of both sides.” The organic arrangement expands market access, reduces duplicative requirements and reduces certification costs while protecting organic integrity.  The U.S. and EU work together to promote organic production and share technical information and best practices in an effort to further enhance the integrity of organic crops and livestock production systems. Carmela Beck, the National Organic Program Manager for Driscoll’s, an exporter of fresh berries, said the equivalency agreement has greatly simplified the export process, reduced confusion and redundancy and provided an opportunity for organic farmers. “The passage of the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement is a great success story and is a testament to the rigor of both the U.S. and EU organic standards,” Beck said.” Not only has the flow of trade been increased but the National Organic Program and the European Commission continue to work diligently to protect organic integrity in a global economy. Organic farmers now have even more opportunity to grow their businesses to meet this growing, global demand for organic products.” Amy’s Kitchen is one American company that has seen the benefit of the organic equivalence arrangement. Amy’s has seen a tenfold increase in its UK and EU business. “Since the U.S.-EU equivalency agreement took effect, Amy’s Kitchen is now able to export products directly from its U.S. manufacturing facilities,” said Andy Berliner, CEO and Co-founder of Amy’s Kitchen. ""This has led to a tremendous increase in business for Amy’s across the board, including the ability to share information about Amy’s foods being organic in the UK and EU on our packaging, a rise from 15 to more than 60 products now offered in the UK and EU over the last five years.” The partnership, while providing a strong foundation to globally promote organic agriculture, is also a win for the American economy. Industry estimates show that the market for U.S. organics sales to the EU could grow more than 300 percent, from $70 million to $300 million, a huge boost for a growing sector of our agricultural economy. It also means higher incomes for organic farmers and ranchers, more opportunities for small businesses, and jobs for people who package, ship, and market organic products. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service and Foreign Agricultural Service, along with the Office of the United States Trade Representative, were instrumental in developing the organic equivalency agreement between the EU and U.S. and have also worked to develop similar agreements with Canada and Japan.

"Deputy Administrator, AMS Dairy Programs in  Trade  Jun 19,  U.S. dairy exports are currently valued at $6 billion and the country is the world’s leading exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. USDA Photo Courtesy of Scott Bauer. Every June, USDA joins the rest of the country to celebrate Dairy Month. It is a time to thank our nation’s dairy producers and processors for their tireless work to produce quality dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt. Here at USDA, besides getting our fill of our favorite dairy products, we celebrate our nation’s dairy industry every day by finding new markets where people can enjoy their products. This often entails working with other countries’ governments to negotiate export and import requirements as well as helping businesses meet these requirements. Our nation’s dairy exporters reach new markets with the help of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). Export certificates are often the critical piece in the trade puzzle. On this front, AMS offers certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports. Our Dairy Programs can verify that businesses’ dairy products meet export requirements. The AMS Dairy Grading Branch provides export certificates for products or conditions for which they have documentation for or from plants they inspect. Certificates are paper or electronic documents which describe and attest to attributes of consignments of food destined for international trade. Certification of food may be based on a range of inspection activities including continuous online inspection, auditing of the quality assurance system, and examination of finished products. With the help of export certificates, importers can confidently receive products that meet requirements agreed upon by the U.S. and the importing country. As a result, people all over the world enjoy U.S. dairy products. In recent years, AMS helped open up U.S produced products to several major importing nations. In March , our agency enhanced its system, enabling the availability of electronic sanitary export certificates to China. Now exporters can request their China sanitary export certificates using the Electronic Document Creation System (eDocs). China is the world’s largest importer and is currently the second largest export destination for U.S. dairy products. Working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), AMS helped 240 U.S. dairy and infant formula firms get audited and registered to export products to China using our eDocs system. Another example of AMS connecting exporters to new markets happened in when the Customs Union (CU) trade bloc -- composed of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia -- came into existence. A new U.S. – CU dairy veterinary certificate was to resume trade in those countries. Trade was halted in when the CU demanded changes to the current U.S. export health certificate. Negotiations continued until March when AMS was notified that all members of the CU accepted a U.S. proposed export certificate for pasteurized milk products.  The U.S. government interagency team is discussing additional administrative steps before issuing certificates. In addition to negotiating export certificate agreements with other countries, AMS has created a number of resources that will help dairy exporters. We encourage you to check out our Dairy Exports website. We recently held 20 webinar trainings that helped exporters become familiar with our systems. Our sites are equipped with important documents, frequently asked questions, and key contacts. The effort to increase the number of export destinations for U.S. dairy businesses will help continue a positive trend for the industry. In the last 10 years, dairy exports have averaged a 21% increase per year. Currently, U.S. dairy exports are valued at $6 billion and the country is the world’s leading single country exporter of skim milk powder, cheese, whey, and lactose products. AMS is proud to be a leader when it comes to increasing demand for U.S. dairy exports. Whether it’s June or any other time of the year, we are committed to supporting our nation’s dairy producers and processors. We want to make sure that people all over the world can enjoy their quality products. AMS offers a number of services to help U.S. dairy exporters reach new markets. Offering certificates for more than 80% of the countries that accept U.S. dairy exports, AMS has helped the export industry average a 21% increase per year over the last 10 years. USDA Photo.

"Announces Organic Crop Insurance, Other Measure  Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .13  Contact:Office of Communications 720-  Washington, May 14, ― Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today discussed his vision for U.S. organic agriculture and USDA efforts to ensure its continued success during remarks to the Organic Trade Association. Vilsack announced a number of changes and new initiatives to support the continued growth of organic agriculture, including that the USDA's Risk Management Agency's (RMA) federal crop insurance program will increase coverage options for organic producers this year and provide even more options in , including a contract price addendum as well as new premium price elections for organic crops. Additionally, RMA will remove the current five-percent organic rate surcharge on all future crop insurance policies beginning in .Vilsack also said USDA will be providing new guidance and direction on organic production to all USDA agencies in support of organic agriculture and markets. USDA is now asking each agency to routinely address the needs of the organic sector in their programs and services where appropriate. The National Organic Program has supported the continued growth of America's organic sector, which has been increasing market share each year and now is a more than $30 billion industry. Vilsack noted that accurate is the biggest obstacle for developing better crop insurance options for organic farmers and expressed his desire that Congress help USDA make further progress by renewing the Organic Initiative as part of a new Food, Farms and Jobs bill.""Organic agriculture is one of the fastest growing segments of American agriculture and helps farmers receive a higher price for their product as they strive to meet growing consumer demand,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""These new options will extend the safety net provided by crop insurance and provide fair and flexible solutions to organic producers. Coupled with the new guidance for agencies to support this growing sector, USDA recognizes that organics are gaining market share and is helping boost this emerging segment.""New crop-insurance pricing options will be available to organic producers who grow crops under guaranteed contracts beginning with the crop year. This contract price option allows organic producers who receive a contract price for their crop to get a crop insurance guarantee that is more reflective of the actual value of their crop. They will have the ability, where available and at their choice, to use their personal contract price as their price election or to choose existing crop insurance price elections. This contract price option will be available for between 60 and 70 crops in the crop year and this contract price feature will be available to the majority of insured organic crops. RMA is also changing organic transitional yields (t-yields) so they will be more reflective of actual organic farming experience, starting with the crop year.All crops are being evaluated for establishing organic prices for the crop year. Current pricing options only allow farmers to insure organic crops at the conventional prices, with the exception of eight crops (corn, soybeans, cotton, processing tomatoes, avocados, and several fresh stone fruit crops) that already have premium organic price elections. RMA is working to provide organic price elections for six to ten crops in . Oats and mint are two crops that have already been selected for organic price elections in , and apricots, apples, blueberries, millet, and others are still under consideration.USDA's Agriculture Marketing Service last year announced the Organic Literacy Initiative, a public outreach and employee training program to help connect current and prospective organic operations with appropriate USDA resources. To date, over 14,000 USDA employees have taken the basic training on USDA's role in organic agriculture. The new guidance will further improve USDA agencies' ability to incorporate the needs of the growing organic sector into their programs and services. These combined actions should result in staff better equipped to help organic farmers obtain technical and financial assistance, insure crops and livestock, access research findings, secure loans, develop conservation practices, find current organic price information, and access local, regional, and international markets. Through this effort, agencies will also better understand the scope and rigor of the certification process and how it complements their own programs.Organic certification allows farmers and ranchers to receive premium prices for their value-added products. Over the past 10 years, the number of certified organic farms and businesses in the United States has expanded to approximately 17,750, representing a 240 percent increase since USDA first began collecting this . Similarly, the retail value of the organic industry grew almost 9.5 percent in to $31.4 billion. Organic foods continue to gain market share in the food industry, climbing to 4.2 percent of U.S. retail food sales in .USDA has already made several changes to better serve organic customers, including offering more flexible microloans and improving Federal crop insurance programs. To help open new markets for U.S. farmers and ranchers, USDA has streamlined trade with multiple foreign governments. These trade partnerships allow U.S. organic products to be sold as organic in Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, and Japan without maintaining certification to multiple standards. Expanding the reach of U.S. organic products creates opportunities for small businesses and increases jobs for Americans who grow, package, ship and market organic products.USDA is responsible, under the Organic Foods Production Act of (OFPA), for establishing national standards for organically-produced agricultural products. The National Organic Program has been critical for the development of clear standards and enforcing a level playing-field for organic businesses, which has lead to expanded trade opportunities to create new markets for U.S. organic businesses. These standards assure consumers that products with the USDA organic seal meet consistent, uniform standards.

Organic producers were first able to obtain crop insurance under the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of . However, due to the lack of , organic farmers were initially charged an additional 5 percent surcharge and were only able to insure the “conventional price” for their crop - not the organic price.

"National Hunger Fellow, and Julie Curti, Acting Deputy Director, USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 30,   What better way to end the day than by uncovering local food powerhouses in the Nation’s Capital! On Wednesday, April 21, , the USDA and HHS Centers for Faith-based and Neighborhood Partnerships convened to visit two jewels located in Washington, DC: Common Good City Farm of Ledroit Park and Healthy Solutions of Anacostia. Common Good City Farm is an urban farm and education center growing food for low-income residents in the city and providing educational opportunities for all people to increase food security, and improve human health and environmental sustainability.  Common Good City Farm was funded in part by a National Institute for Food and Agriculture Community Food Project Grant. The University of the District of Columbia’s 4-H Club has just partnered with the farm to help their kids learn to grow and eat healthy food.  Supported by USDA, the goal of the 4-H program is to assist young people in developing knowledge, skills, and attitudes that will enable them to become self-directing, responsible, productive citizens.  Common Good City Farm has been successful in part due to strong partnerships with organizations like the 4-H Club, as well as community support from organizations like the Advisory Neighborhood Commission and Mount Bethel Baptist Church. Next, we journeyed across the river to visit a Healthy Solutions youth cooking class. Started by Tanikka Cunningham, Healthy Solutions’ mission is to promote healthy lifestyles in underserved communities.  The students cooked up and ate four delicious dishes that included a fruit salad, a mesclun spring salad, an eggplant pasta sauce, and a tri-colored pasta dish. Healthy Solutions works in Alabama, North Carolina, and Washington, DC to create community-based food systems that allow access to healthy affordable foods.  The organization also focuses on agricultural job creation and training, healthy living education, and youth development.  Healthy Solutions operates a produce coop in DC and sells food to local corner shops in the neighborhood. There are only three major chain grocery stores east of the Anacostia River, so the impact of Healthy Solutions, which brings 10,000 pounds of fresh produce into these communities each month, is critical.  The Obama Administration’s proposed Healthy Food Financing Initiative would send more resources to help bring access to affordable, fresh, and healthy food to communities like Anacostia.

Spurred by Secretary Tom Vilsack’s vision that emphasizes collaboration with stakeholders and restoration of the Nation’s forests, the Forest Service published the report Increasing the Pace of Restoration and Job Creation on Our National Forests in . Since then, the agency has worked feverishly to build shared landscape ownership, anchored in understanding and appreciating of the diverse perspectives our community members bring to the table.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 02,  International School Meals Day raises awareness of the importance of food and nutrition in education and offers an opportunity for students to share school feeding experiences from across the globe. March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  The upsurge in healthy eating and food security campaigns is really resonating with schoolchildren, so much so, that a day has been set aside for youth around the world to share their experiences.  The celebration of this movement – International School Meals Day – draws our attention to the importance of good nutrition for all children. March 3 marks the fourth consecutive year that USDA will partner with the United Kingdom to invite children from across the globe to promote nutrition and school meals, this year focusing on introducing fresh and healthy local fare into their diets. On that day children will connect through social media to share their food experiences and healthy eating habits. I’m looking forward to witnessing the fun first-hand at Glen Forest Elementary School in Fairfax County, Va., where students will Skype with their peers at Washingborough Academy in the UK. I’m sure it will be a great learning experience for the students and me alike. In the last decade the momentum for healthier eating has found a place in the world’s conscience.  The International School Meals Day initiative literally brings together the world’s children to elevate awareness on the importance of nutritional quality in school meal programs while raising universal consciousness of hunger and poverty. As a lifelong school nutrition advocate I am delighted by the progress that’s been made both domestically and internationally to improve the nutrition and well-being of our youth. To see children the world over embrace this health movement is inspiring. So on behalf of USDA I offer a heartfelt “thank you” to the organizers of International School Meals Day and all those who participate. You are helping ensure a brighter and healthier future for our world!

"Director, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Oct 25,  American Indian students at Navajo Technical College, in Crownpoint, New Mexico, are using new lab and equipment to develop the veterinary skills they need to work with large animals. (Photo courtesy of Navajo Technical College) Oct. 20, , is an important milestone in our nation’s history in regards to equity in research, education, and extension. On that date, 29 tribal colleges, representing different histories, cultural orientations, and organizational structures, received land-grant university (LGU) status. Such LGU status gave these institutions—referred to as LGUs—access to federal resources to help improve the lives of tribal students, while respecting sovereignty and promoting self-sufficiency in American Indian communities. In the ensuing 23 years, significant progress has occurred in building capacity at the land-grant system to better serve Native American students and communities. The s are part of the family of land-grants that the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) supports through research, education, and extension programs. These programs recruit and retain students in the food and agricultural sciences, enhance economic opportunities and quality of life, improve nutrition and health, and protect natural resources and the environment. The tribal colleges and universities, now numbering 34, are located in 13 states and provide access to higher education to over 80 percent of Indian Country. Collectively, they enroll approximately 20,000 students and provide vital services to some 50,000 tribal community members. Unlike most institutions of higher education, the s teach in a cultural context that empowers students by drawing on the strength of their people’s histories, indigenous knowledge, and traditions. The s provide much-needed high school completion (GED), basic remediation, job training, college preparatory courses, and adult basic education programs. They serve as community libraries and centers, tribal archives, career and business centers, economic development centers, public meeting places, and elder and child care centers. Examples of the strength of community, education, pride, and opportunity abound in Indian Country. Here are just a few: Chief Dull Knife College, in Lame Deer, Montana, developed welding courses to train apprentice welders to find jobs that could eventually triple the average salary of their Cheyenne reservation. At Fort Totten, North Dakota, Cankdeska Cikana Community College provided the Spirit Lake Tribe citizens new extension education that helped reduce diabetes and improved health. The Institute of American Indian Arts, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, is integrating agricultural science into every curriculum, linking them to American Indian worldviews, stories, and tradition. Join me in congratulating our institutions on their 23rd Anniversary. As we look into the future, there is much more work to be done, and the partnership between NIFA and s will continue to grow and be healthy, reflecting the rich history and culture of the American Indian peoples. While respecting sovereignty, we hope all of us succeed in our efforts to serve the people and the land. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Powerful Partnerships Feed Hungry Milwaukee Kids in the Summertime   An African proverb holds that it takes a village to raise a child. And what’s a village? Well, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it’s the Milwaukee Hunger Task Force (the State’s largest food bank and anti-hunger advocacy organization), Kohl’s Department Stores, Milwaukee Public Schools, the Salvation Army, Boys and Girls Clubs, the Social Development Commission and the Milwaukee Park System. When the school year ends, many children and teens who rely on USDA school meals are at a higher risk of going hungry during the summer when school is not in session. USDA’s Summer Food Service Program can make sure that kids don’t go hungry summer, but the program can’t work without sponsors and supportive communities.  Ollice C.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  May 11,   The United Kingdom (UK) has long played an important role in U.S. agricultural exports. This history dates back to the completion of the Erie Canal in the early s, which linked the Great Lakes to the Atlantic seaboard, significantly increasing the export of food, particularly Midwestern wheat, to England. To this day, the United Kingdom offers tremendous opportunities for U.S. agriculture and the United States exports more than $1.6 billion annually in agricultural, fish and forestry products to the UK. Many of these products are showcased each year during USDA-endorsed trade shows, such as the International Food Exhibition (IFE), which took place in London in March. Nineteen U.S. companies participated in the U.S. Pavilion, including 11 new-to-market and new-to-export companies. Several U.S. companies were lucky enough to meet with the Olympic Organizing Committee that had a team looking for products to be used at the Summer Olympics in London in . The exhibition produced $469,000 in on-site sales and $1.9 million in projected 12-month sales. Robin Rhea, owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., is pictured here during the International Food Exhibition (IFE) in London. During the show, U.S. exhibitors introduced more than 100 new products, ranging from sauces to baby food to ice cream. Delicious sauces are the name of the game for Slather Brand Foods Inc., a new-to-export company who explored export opportunities as part of the U.S. pavilion. Robin Rhea is the owner of Slather Brand Foods, Inc., based in Charleston, South Carolina. As a Southern U.S. Trade Association (SUSTA) member, she learned about the assistance USDA’s market development programs provide to companies like hers. Ms. Rhea used Market Access Program (MAP) funding in order to participate in this year’s show in London, a first for her company. She credits her attendance at the show with helping her connect with potential exporters and assess the opportunity to sell her product outside of the United States. “The UK market is definitely ready for Slather Brand Slatherin' Sauce,” said Ms. Rhea. “There is very little competition to speak of in the sauce category.  Moreover, the UK is just coming into its own in terms of BBQ and they are hungry for diversified products. In addition to retail markets there was an overwhelming interest in the food service industry and it will top our targeted list when we are ready to export.” The company plans to continue to expand its domestic reach in the coming year and explore exports as part of its business plan in . The knowledge and contacts Slather Brand Foods gained from attendance at IFE have prepared the company for this venture. To learn more about market development programs, visit the FAS website.

"USDA Tribal Collaboration Strengthens Food Security on Nevada's Indian Reservations  Today in Nevada more than one in four children live in households that cannot reliably provide nutritious meals every day.  This dubious distinction makes it the state with the nation’s fourth highest rate of child hunger.  And for children living on Indian reservations, the incidence of hunger may be even higher. What does food insecurity look like on Nevada reservations?  With few places to shop, reservation residents have very limited access to fresh produce.  Food insecurity not only equates to a lack of nutritious foods available, but also means families must drive great distances to a grocery store.  To cope, families choose more canned and frozen foods that will last until the next weekly or monthly shopping trip, which often means less consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.  Melissa Baker, Program Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service, Western Region Special Nutrition Programs  Posted in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 18,   Respond to this story","What are some consequences of food insecurity for families living on Nevada Indian reservations, particularly when it comes to accessing nutritious foods?","For families living on Nevada Indian reservations, food insecurity leads to limited access to fresh produce, reliance on canned and frozen foods that last longer, resulting in reduced consumption of fruits and vegetables."

"Boston Beats the Asian Longhorned Beetle  One of the things I consider a highlight of my career and that I will always remember is our successful response to the July detection of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) in Boston, Massachusetts.  As I attended the May 12 ceremony commemorating the eradication of the ALB infestation in Boston and listened to the speakers share their thoughts about what it took to get us there, I had a deep sense of appreciation for the partnership among the state and federal cooperators who worked together to bring us to that day.  It was swift action and continued diligence that protected Boston’s trees from further destruction. APHIS and its cooperators were able to accomplish the goal of eradicating ALB in Boston in less than 4 years.  Thanks also go to a community member who reported the infestation early.  That early detection and report resulted in the loss of only 6 infested trees. But as I celebrate our first victory over the invasive pest in Massachusetts, I am compelled to ask you to remain vigilant in inspecting your trees regularly for signs of the beetle and report any suspicious damage to your State Plant Health Director.

"Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 21,   If you haven’t heard the buzz, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service’s expansion of the Team Up for School Nutrition Success  initiative is in full swing, with 20 completed trainings and 14 more scheduled for . Team Up offers a unique learning experience that enhances schools’ food service operations through training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals looking to maintain a healthy environment and encourage strong student meal program participation. What exactly happens at a Team Up training? Ever had an “a-ha” or a “why didn’t I think of that” moment when a friend shares a really great idea? Team Up is where “a-ha” moments are shared among school nutrition professionals and turned into action back via their school meals programs. Let’s break down a Team Up workshop to see how these “a-ha” moments transpire. A peer mentor shares her best practices for menu planning during the Wisconsin Team Up training. Best Practice Panel Presentations  Great ideas are meant for sharing. Team Up workshops kick off with panels where participants hear school nutrition peer mentors share their best practices and strategies for issues like increasing school meal program participation, menu planning and financial management. At the Georgia Team Up training, participants share ideas and questions for menu planning and increasing program participation. Breakout Sessions  This is where the magic happens! After listening to best practice presentations, participants break out into small groups for a round of brainstorming and problem-solving around each specific topic, all with best practice ideas in mind. Using the Egan Skilled Helper Model, which uses an opportunity-development approach, school nutrition peer mentors guide and facilitate discussions as participants identify their program challenges and develop solutions with their peers.  During the breakout sessions, participants examine: What is going on in my school nutrition program? What does a better outcome look like? How do I get to the better outcome? How do I make it all happen?  The Action Plan  Participants examined their challenges and solutions and excitement is building around progress and potential opportunities identified during the breakout sessions. What do participants do with all of these great ideas? Peer mentors help participants put their specific strategies and solutions into an action plan using SMART goals, which are defined as goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time‐bound. Participants take their action plan home as a guide to implement their Team Up strategies and solutions in their school nutrition programs.  Resources  Operating a school meals program can be challenging, but school nutrition directors don’t have to do it alone. Team Up workshops invite allied organizations to share their free school nutrition resources that support school food service operations and help create a healthy school environment. Participants can use these resources as they move forward with implementing their action plan in their school nutrition programs.  Networking is another valuable resource Team Up workshops provide, giving school nutrition directors opportunities to develop working relationships with their peer mentors and other school nutrition directors in their state. Many directors who have attended a Team Up training have expressed that they’re not alone and can turn to their fellow director. “I can now see what areas I need to work and improve on in my program. I see that I am not alone in my journey. I have many helpful people that I can rely on for help and guidance. The Team Up training was valuable to me because I am more comfortable talking to my peers. I see I am not alone and I can ask for help.” – Rebecca Lusk, Manager/Supervisor, Towns County Schools, Hiawassee, Ga.  After the Workshop  The Team Up workshop may be complete, but the Team Up spirit lives on. After returning home, participants roll up their sleeves, take a deep breath, and take the first steps outlined in their Team Up action plan - and then real life happens. Barriers pop up as action plans are implemented, but there’s no reason to get discouraged. Team Up peer mentors and state agencies are still available should participants have questions or get stuck with their action plan. In addition, USDA together with the Institute of Child Nutrition hosts monthly webinars for school nutrition professionals to expand their knowledge and tools on a wide variety of topics; webinars recordings are made available online for later viewing.  And this is why Team Up workshops are so effective – Team Up encourages school nutrition professionals to continue to network with their peers and problem-solve school nutrition program barriers long after the workshop is completed. No one is an island, and we must team up to make school meals accessible, nutritious and delicious!

"Amy Mazerall and Mydina Thabet, Child Nutrition Programs, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 14,  Food service staff serves barbeque chicken to students. (Photo courtesy of Right Light Photography, LLC) The school nutrition community is celebrating National School Lunch Week from October 10-14. This year’s theme “Show Your Spirit” is all about encouraging parents, students and school officials to show their spirit for school lunch. Through the Team Up for School Nutrition Success (Team Up) initiative, school nutrition professionals have teamed up to provide nutritious and appealing meals to students, offering plenty of reasons for all of us to show spirit for awesome school meals! The Team Up initiative, created through a partnership between the United States Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and the Institute of Child Nutrition (ICN), provides school nutrition professionals a unique learning experience.  The initiative is designed to enhance schools’ food service operations by providing training and peer-to-peer mentorship to school nutrition professionals who want to maintain a healthy environment and strong student meal program participation. The goal of this training is to help schools find simple ways to meet the updated USDA nutrition standards from the Healthy, Hunger Free Kids Act (HHFKA), while increasing the number of students enjoying healthy and flavorful school meals. Donna Harris, the former Child Nutrition Director for Perquimans County Schools in North Carolina, attended the first Team Up pilot training in in the Southeast Region. Harris was seeking better way to engage students in school meals. During this Team Up training, she learned best practices, tips and tricks for increasing participation in school meals through panel presentations by school nutrition peer mentors. After the presentations, Harris joined other school nutrition directors to network and brainstorm on creative solutions for common topics such as menu planning and financial management.  Directors turned their ideas into achievable goals as they created action plans using SMART goals with the help of their peer mentors. SMART goals are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. In her action plan, Harris wanted to tackle increasing school meal program participation in the district’s middle and high schools, so she set SMART goals to obtain student feedback and create student-approved menus. Back at her district, she conducted two student surveys and group discussions to gauge student preference.  As a result, several new student-approved recipes were added to the menu: barbeque chicken, buffalo chicken wraps, chicken salad wraps and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Although students had not responded well to meals that align with these updated nutrition standards in the past, Harris received positive feedback on the additions once she engaged students in nutrition education, explaining the USDA nutrition standards that schools must follow. In fact, the school’s student government association assisted in explaining the nutrition standards to students.  Harris demonstrated that when students have a voice in school menus and understand the USDA nutrition standards, they are more satisfied and more likely to purchase school meals.  This was evidenced by a notable increase in student meal counts on the days that new menu items were offered. Even school staff provided positive feedback: “the lunches taste good!” and “it was delicious!” Harris has since retired from Perquimans County Schools, but before her departure, she shared her action plan and best practices learned from the Team Up training with the new director. Harris wanted to see the Team Up spirit live on and encouraged the child nutrition department to utilize the Team Up peer mentorship model to train school nutrition staff. FNS also wanted to see the Team Up initiative live on after the Team Up training pilot received rave reviews from attendees. In , FNS hosted an additional six regional trainings to school nutrition professionals nationwide. The regional trainings were equally successful, and now the Team Up initiative has been expanding to state agencies in . So far, 26 trainings have been completed in 25 states, with 11 more scheduled for the remainder of this year. To read about the success of completed State Team Up trainings, visit ICN’s website. Harris is one of many school nutrition professionals who inspire us to show spirit for school meals. FNS thanks all school nutrition staff who work tirelessly to provide our students a nutritious start to a bright future! During National School Lunch Week, we continue to celebrate the progress that has been made in school meals, child nutrition and the overall school environment over the last seven and a half years. USDA is committed to providing school nutrition professionals with the resources they need to help today’s children grow into tomorrow’s healthy leaders. FNS’ Team Nutrition is also celebrating National School Lunch Week by announcing the availability of a number of newly modernized and standardized recipes on the What’s Cooking? USDA Mixing Bowl website for use in schools and childcare centers. These recipes are developed to assist child nutrition professionals in meeting the meal pattern requirements by providing appealing, kid-approved meals that incorporate whole grains and a wide variety of vegetables and legumes.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 25,  USDA’s What’s Shaking? resources offer creative ways to boost flavor with less sodium. (Click to enlarge) What’s shaking in USDA’s school meals programs?  Delicious and nutritious food, that’s what!  Healthy food does not have to be bland or boring.  There’s more to creating a tasty meal than just dousing food in dressing or layering on salty sauces.  It’s easy to make your dish pop without adding excess sodium.  Many schools around the country have figured out creative ways to serve low-sodium meals that maximize taste.  So what can you do this school year to “spice” things up and take school meals to the next level? Add flavor, not salt – Condiments like soy sauce, ketchup, barbecue sauce, and hot sauce may contain high amounts of sodium.  Fresh or dried herbs, spices, lemon or orange zest, or 100 percent fruit juices can enhance flavors in foods naturally. Cook with fresh food – When possible, cook with fresh produce or minimally processed foods like no-salt-added frozen or canned vegetables. Setting up farm to school arrangements help make this a cinch!  USDA Foods also offers a variety of options. Set up “Flavor Stations” – Create “flavor stations” in the cafeteria where students can add sodium-free herbs and spices such as basil, curry, black and red pepper, garlic, ginger, or rosemary to customize meals to their taste buds.  Flavor stations give students a chance to be the chef and create one-of-a-kind dishes! Check out “What’s Cooking?” – This USDA site features hundreds of low sodium, large quantity recipes for inspiration.  How about some “Rainbow Rice” or “Honey-Lemon Chicken”?  Yes, please!   Shop around – Pay attention to sodium levels when you’re purchasing food.  The amount can vary widely from brand to brand.  Be sure to write bids that specifically request lower sodium options. Does your school have any other creative ways to boost flavor while still promoting healthy, low-sodium diets?  Share them with us in the comments section below!

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Information Staff in  Research and Science  Oct 26,  Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) employees at the unveiling of the sign for the BARC Student Discovery Garden. This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA's rich science and research portfolio.  When George Washington Carver laid out key elements of his blueprint for education, he could never have guessed that the cutting-edge work of 21st century agricultural science would find a 7,000-acre rural home—right in the middle of the maze of highways and high-rises, homes and businesses that make up the Washington metropolitan region. One hundred years after the federal government first began buying huge tracts of farmland, meadows and woods outside the District of Columbia, a group of scientists, researchers, students and other volunteers who work at the sprawling Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) are taking a page out of the renowned scientist’s book—literally, a textbook. The whole idea, as laid out in Carver’s “Nature Study and Gardening For Rural Schools,” is making sure school kids get their hands dirty. In that spirit, volunteers from the Beltsville Area Diversity Task Force and its technology, education and outreach group started planning about a year ago for an unassuming project for students that would echo Carver’s “learning by doing” educational philosophy. The idea of establishing an old-fashioned victory garden that would continue outreach efforts to students in local schools seemed to be a perfect match. The Student Discovery Garden, as it has come to be known, has been up and growing since last spring, fueled by the energy of volunteers and students. The garden, all organic with raised beds, includes seven sections, each focusing on one of the research programs at BARC, including breeding native crops to keeping non-native species from pushing their way in.  Another learning experience for an all-organic garden was an infestation of Colorado potato bugs that were laboriously smashed one at a time.  Another addition to the urban students’ knowledge base: They found out that stink bugs really live up to their name!

"Field Ecologist in  Forestry  Research and Science  Aug 30,  Forest Service field ecologist Jimmy Grogan at the Marajoara field site in southeast Pará, Brazil. The ‘sororoca’ plant with the wide leaves is a relative of the banana. Although the photo was taken in the daytime, the light is low because the researchers are in the forest understory. Photo by M. Loveless I have lived and worked abroad for most of my adult life, including many years in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, so it was not too difficult adjusting to life in the Brazilian Amazon. I learned to speak Portuguese in the field; my tutors were the field assistants that I hired locally. The politics of doing research on this species are challenging and complicated. That side of my research has been almost as educational and fascinating as the actual fieldwork.  I’ve been fortunate to live and work in remote forests where there are no villages or towns nearby, no noise or light pollution, no electricity, and no running water when the streams dry up during the dry season. Under those conditions, it’s possible to experience forest life on a very satisfying level. As a plant ecologist, I can observe the daily and seasonal rhythms of growth and dormancy at the level of the forest community — by that I mean the growth and flowering and fruiting schedules that trees and other plants keep through the year and from year to year. When you are there every day in the middle of it, these rhythms gradually come into focus, and the forest comes alive in a way that feels completely integrated. Many people find it surprising to learn that the Brazilian rain forest and the other tropical forests I’ve worked in are not perpetually wet and steaming. Mahogany only grows naturally in tropical forests that have a pronounced dry season for one-third to one-half of the year. When that happens, the streams dry up, the trees drop their leaves, the understory goes brown, the ticks and deerflies come out, and everything gets wilted in the heat until the rains come back. The most important thing people should know about mahogany is the same thing they should know about other living species that we humans consume – if consumption exceeds supply indefinitely, supply will vanish.

This spring will see the return of the large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. (U.S. Forest Service photo/ Bob Rabaglia) The buzz this spring has started, and some people may think it’s fodder for a new sci-fi movie. But this year’s spring brings a drama closer to home than you think - the pending emergence of brood II of the periodical cicada. Cicadas are large, colorful, fly-like bugs with large eyes and tented wings. As the male cicadas sing their intense mating songs, some brand it as the sound of summer. “Annual cicadas, known as dog-day cicadas in the U.S., are found throughout the world,” said Sandy Liebhold, a research entomologist with the U.S Forest Service’s Northern Research Station. “But the periodical cicadas emerge in massive groups known as “broods” once every 13 or 17 years and are completely unique to North America.” There are 15 brood cycles, each designated by roman numerals. In the U.S., brood II is on track to crawl out of the ground very soon after a 17-year hiatus. They’ll emerge into one of the most densely populated urban/suburban forests in the world. The mass emergence of brood II into the state and private forests of the tri-state area of eastern Connecticut, upstate New York, and northern New Jersey will sound a bit different than the familiar dog-day cicadas. Male cicadas use a special membrane to echo a series of clicks through its abdomen to attract females for reproduction. In chorus, the brood may sound like an insect-sized fleet of jets preparing for lift off, but the sound should be enjoyed as a wonderful spectacle of the mating ritual in the animal world. Once mated, females will lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind, known in the scientific world as oviposition injury, can be quite striking and lead to “flagging” -- the dieback of small limbs. Forest health aerial surveys conducted by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation reported more than 8,700 acres with flagging left behind from the brood XIV emergence on Cape Cod in . The scarring is mostly superficial but can have a mild impact on the growth of individual host trees. However, the mass emergence can benefit the longer, overall health of eastern forests. After mating and laying eggs, adult cicadas die and fall to the forest floor. The nutrients released from the mass decay of the brood create a jolt of healthy nutrients available to forest organisms. Researchers have shown that this pulse of nutrition leads to an increase of beneficial microbes and nitrogen in soil, increased tree growth and more robust wildflowers. Finally, after three to four weeks, the eggs hatch, the larvae wander under the forest floor where they feed on roots and start the process over again. So, why every 13 to 17 years? Scientists have been pondering this ecological phenomenon for centuries. “There is no doubt that by simultaneously emerging at those long intervals, periodical cicadas are able to saturate predators thereby maintaining high population levels,” said Liebhold. Recent research also hypothesizes that periodical cicadas emerge when predator birds are at a lower density, suggesting that these amazing insects have queued into a larger ecological cycle – wow! This is what we know but there is still a lot of mystery surrounding these time-travelling bugs. So if you find yourself one of the lucky ones to experience their visit, just sit back and enjoy this remarkable wonder of eastern forests. Michael Bohne is an entomologist and forest health group leader with the U.S. Forest Service in Durham, N.H. After mating, female cicadas lay their eggs into the young twigs of trees and shrubs. The scars left behind can lead to the dieback of small limbs called flagging. Such was the case for these bur oak trees in central Iowa in after a brood emergence of the 17-year cicada.

"and Lindsay K. Campbell, Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Sep 11,  G.R.A.C.E Memorial in Glen Rock, New Jersey, is in Veterans Park directly across from the town's commuter train station. The site was chosen by the Glen Rock Assistance Council and Endowment after input of family members in the community directly affected by 9/11. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) Living memorials serve as a reminder of fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, neighbors and friends—but also of the power of community to reflect, rebuild and renew. Our research suggests that living memorials demonstrate the role of nature in contemporary times not only as a symbol, but as an innate and purposeful response to loss that calls forth a common humanity and compassion for others. In other words, they demonstrate how people use nature to be resilient to loss. For 13 years, the U.S. Forest Service has built upon a unique partnership called the Living Memorials Project centered on one of the most significant events in recent history: Sept. 11, , also referred to as 9/11, the day four carefully coordinated terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. That day, two passenger planes hit the World Trade Center’s twin towers in New York City, another flew into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a fourth originally targeting Washington crashed in a Shanksville, Pennsylvania, field after passengers tried to stop the hijackers. Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, New York, created a memorial grove on the hospital campus. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The living memorials project began in when Congress asked the Forest Service to create a program that draws upon the resonating power of trees to bring people together and help foster healing in communities across the nation in response to 9/11. The project includes a grant program to support community-based greening efforts and a research component that developed a National Registry of living memorials across the country. This year, as communities gather to mark the 14th anniversary of 9/11, some will do so at local town memorial parks and gardens – living memorials that pay respect to those who lost their lives and thank thousands more who ran toward the chaos to help. This summer, a team from the agency’s Northern Research Station set out to revisit some of the sites listed on the Living Memorials Registry. Joined by Heather McMillen, an anthropologist and postdoctoral social scientist with the research station, the teams were curious to learn if the sites were maintained. If so, who takes care of them? Did circumstances and other events change the nature of the memorials or had they, over time, stood still? What story could the trees and the landscape itself tell us? From Connecticut's state memorial in Sherwood Island State Park on the Long Island Sound visitors have a panoramic view of lower Manhattan where the World Trade Center once stood. Victims’ families requested a memorial where they could experience the healing effects of water. (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry) The sites range from forests such as Sterling Forest State Park in Tuxedo, New York. To beaches, like the Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, as well as city parks, community gardens, traffic islands, waterfront piers, street trees and arboretums. Many of the living memorial sites we visited 14 years ago still remain and continue to serve an important role for their local constituents. When asked, ‘What are you most proud of here?” nearly all of the site stewards responded, “That we did it.  And it’s still here.”  Many of the living memorials along the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut coast sustained heavy damage during Hurricane Sandy and were rebuilt and replanted. Some signs at the sites not only recognize a diverse list of supporters but also tell the story of that day from the perspective of local towns and communities, including personal sentiments regarding loved ones lost and for those who survived. In each case, local residents draw upon the landscape to create a place of comfort, reflection and a sense of beauty. As these places age, some areas do struggle with care and maintenance but are not giving up. Many families have planted survivor trees on sites and are eager to find ways to protect them as long as possible.      Updates from the field will be available on the Living Memorials Project website. Memorials created from - are displayed on a National Map that formed the basis of the public multi-media exhibition Land-Markings: 12 Journeys through 9/11 Living Memorials, created in collaboration with Parsons The New School for Design. The exhibit was on display in at the National Park Service’s Federal Hall National Memorial on Wall Street. The exhibit catalog and DVD are available free for public use. Videos can be viewed online. The Hometown Memorial in the Town of Babylon, New York, is situated on the coastal dunes of Long Island. The barrier beaches are considered the town’s greatest natural assets. “It was felt that this area possessed scenic beauty and views yet has sufficient open space to provide a quiet environment for remembrance and reflection.” (Courtesy Living Memorials Project National Registry)  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  Connecticut  Forestry  FS  Hurricane Sandy  Long Island  memorial  mourning  New Jersey  New York  New York City  Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry  Northern Research Station  Pennsylvania  remembrances  Research  September 11  trees  veterans  Washington DC","What role do living memorials, which utilize nature as an innate response to loss, play in fostering community resilience and reflecting collective humanity after significant events such as 9/11?","Living memorials serve as a reminder of the power of community to reflect, rebuild, and renew, demonstrating how people use nature to be resilient to loss and call forth common humanity and compassion for others."

As the world population grows, agricultural science will play an important role in helping us combat hunger and malnutrition around the globe. (photo courtesy of the World Food Program/Rein Skullerud) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA's rich science and research portfolio. The world is not merely facing a challenge of sustainably producing enough food to feed a world whose population will exceed 9 billion by , but also confronting the continuous challenge of ensuring that nutritious and safe food reaches needy families, so that every child can have a safe and healthy childhood.  Combating this urgent crisis requires a global collaborative effort.  According to experts, by agricultural production will need to increase by 70% to meet increased demand for food, diet changes and additional demand for industrial uses for plants.  To help meet this goal, USDA has developed a Global Food Security strategy, focused on research, development, education and extension.  As part of USDA’s Office of the Chief Scientist series of white papers on USDA’s research portfolio, this plan aligns USDA’s food security research with the goals of President Obama’s Global Food Security Initiative, Feed the Future. In implementing the strategy, USDA will seek and build upon existing partnerships with research institutions at home and abroad, as well as in the private sector.  We are very heartened that our colleagues in other countries and donor organizations share our interest.  This May, the G8 Leaders announced the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition to improve food security in Africa.  The G8 Leaders also endorsed the establishment of global platforms to facilitate sharing of reliable agricultural and information, which is crucial for research, for decision making by farmers and to help connect them to the marketplace.   Similarly, the June Rio+20 Summit resolved to enhance agricultural science and improve productivity and sustainability through voluntary sharing of knowledge and good practices and by strengthening international cooperation on agricultural research.  These commitments made by USDA, the G8 and Rio+20 have been taken to the next level by the G20 whose leaders recently announced their support for a series of recommendations to sustainably increase agricultural productivity.  These steps include strengthening global collaboration and cooperation on agricultural science through a regular meeting of agricultural Chief Scientists (MACS) with the goal of identifying global research priorities and targets and facilitating collaboration between public and private sector organizations in the key areas most likely to drive sustainable agricultural productivity gains. These developments have a lot of promise for helping coordinate the fight against global hunger.

"Moving Back to Rural America: Why Some Return Home and What Difference It Makes  Population loss persists in rural America, especially in more remote areas with limited scenic amenities. Communities in these areas are attuned to the annual out-migration of their “best and brightest” high school graduates, typically a third or more of each class. But stemming rural population loss--and spurring economic development--may depend less on retaining young adults after high school and more on attracting former residents some years later. Researchers at the University of Montana and USDA’s Economic Research Service visited 21 rural communities during and and conducted 300 interviews at high school reunions. The aim was to better understand what motivates return migration and the barriers to such moves. Reunions allowed for simultaneous interviews with both return migrants and nonreturn migrants.

NAD is an office that directly to the Secretary of Agriculture and is, by law, independent from the direction and control of any other agency within USDA.  Our sole mission is to conduct impartial administrative appeals hearings of adverse program decisions by the following USDA agencies: the Farm Service Agency, the Risk Management Agency, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Rural Housing Agency, the Rural Business Cooperative Service, and the Rural Utilities Service.   Anyone who disagrees with an agency program decision can resolve their dispute by filing an appeal with NAD and receiving a hearing. A NAD hearing provides an opportunity for an appellant to present their case, including any new evidence, before an independent Administrative Judge (AJ).  The AJ reviews the facts and evidence presented and determines if the agency decision was in error.  On this website, you’ll find everything you need to know about NAD, from how and where to file an appeal to searching previous NAD decisions for reference.  It’s designed to be user-friendly so you can find your way around easily and obtain information quickly.  You can read about filing an appeal and how to contact us.

"The People's Garden Apiary, installed in , is located on the roof of the Jamie L. Whitten Building and has homed up to approximately 80,000 Italian honey bees. USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Bee Research Lab in Beltsville, Maryland, helps keep these colonies of bees strong and healthy so they can pollinate crops growing in the People's Garden and neighboring landscapes. They also produce delicious honey! Beehives are often important elements of urban gardens due to the pollination services they provide. They’re also big business. Honeybees pollinate $ates each year, including more than 130 types of fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Honeybees also produce honey, worth about $3.2 million in according to USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). How are hives constructed? The beehives are wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other. Each box (or super) holds 8-10 wooden frames which include a thin sheet of wax foundation in each frame. The bees build their combs on these foundations. How is honey extracted? Honey is stored in the combs in the upper parts of the hive. When the bees have filled the combs in the upper section with honey and covered them with wax caps, the beekeeper takes them away to extract the honey. Are honey bees native to the United States? Honey bees are not native to the United States. The scientific name for honey bee is Apis mellifera. Since humans first began keeping honey bees, their principal aim has been the harvest of honey. Beekeepers select the appropriate type of honey bee based on temperament, physical characteristics, disease resistance, and productivity. Italian honey bees were selected for the People's Garden Apiary because they are most often used in commercial beekeeping in the United States. These bees have a relatively gentle disposition and are good honey producers. They are not the most resistant to disease, but they excel in most other areas. There have been some queen survivorship issues in both of the People's Garden colonies, which actually mirrors what's going on in the rest of the country. Queen health is an issue for everyone who buys queens, commercial or hobbyist. The exact underlying reasons for poor queen survivorship is unknown, but the ARS lab is actively researching this problem.","What are some common characteristics of constructed beehives used in commercial beekeeping, and how do they facilitate honey production and harvesting?","In commercial beekeeping, beehives are typically wooden box-like sections stacked on top of each other, with 8-10 wooden frames per super, containing a thin sheet of wax foundation. This design allows bees to build combs for honey storage in the upper parts of the hive, which can then be extracted by the beekeeper when the combs are filled and capped with wax."

"It's ideal to have host plants and nectar plants growing in your garden if your goal is to attract butterflies. Selecting what to plant varies enormously based on what butterfly species you wish to attract. Butterflies will roam in search of food and egg-laying sites for many miles—even hundreds to thousands—of miles. Butterflies lay their eggs on host plants that the emerging caterpillars will eat. Different species of butterflies prefer different types of plants to lay their eggs on. Milkweed and Monarch Butterflies The monarch butterfly however is very specific and only lays her eggs on species of Asclepias - commonly known as milkweed. Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies migrate from the United States and Canada to overwintering areas in Mexico and California and make the return flight in spring. Threats, including loss of milkweed habitat, are having a devastating impact on monarch populations. By planting milkweed you can help save the monarch butterfly.","What is the primary host plant that Monarch Butterfly caterpillars eat, and why is it crucial to have this plant in your garden to support their life cycle?","The primary host plant for Monarch Butterfly caterpillars is milkweed (Asclepias), which is crucial to have in your garden as the caterpillars will only eat this specific type of plant, making it essential for supporting their life cycle."

"Administrator, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Nutrition Security  Apr 25,  Setting kids up for success. It’s what every parent, guardian, and educator wants for our nation’s schoolchildren. They understand the power that small changes have to make a big difference in the learning environment. That’s why here at USDA, we recently announced a generational investment in our children’s futures through updated school nutrition standards. Right now, schools across our country are serving breakfasts and lunches to nearly 30 million children every day. Healthy school meals that represent the main source of nutrition for more than half of these students and are an essential part of the educational landscape — like teachers, books, or computers – helping to unlock kids’ full potential in and out of the classroom. It is no surprise that poor nutrition and diet-related diseases are correlated with lower academic achievement, worse health outcomes, and more behavioral problems for kids. We recognize the tremendous work that educators and school nutrition professionals do every day to ensure our children are fueled to thrive. Healthy school meals are an essential element of a quality education and are a part of the solution to promote children’s health. We know that this work is not easy, which is why the Biden-Harris Administration has made historic investments to help schools provide healthy and nutritious meals to students. School breakfast offers the jump start to a great day. It sets the tone for the rest of the day, especially for children. It’s why kids who eat breakfast have increased alertness and improved moods throughout the morning, fostering a better learning experience. What’s more, studies find that students who participate in school meal programs consume more whole grains, milk, fruits, and vegetables during mealtimes and enjoy better overall diet quality. These pivotal updates we are making to school nutrition standards have been shaped by a host of stakeholders, including parents, devoted teachers, school administrators, school nutrition directors, and industry leaders, and are informed by the latest Dietary for Americans. These new standards allow us to take the next step in putting kids’ health at the forefront by:  Reducing the amounts of added sugars in school meals, especially at breakfast.  Making it easier to offer healthy proteins at breakfast.  Scaling back sodium levels over time.  Continuing to emphasize fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains, to give kids the right balance of nutrients for healthy, tasty meals. That’s not all. We are also providing flexibilities to make it easier for schools to accommodate vegetarian diets and the cultural and religious food preferences of students. This way, every child has access to the nutritious foods they desire and deserve to nourish their bodies and minds. We encourage educators to uplift these school meal enhancements as an opportunity to maximize the impact of what they do best – educate. Because it’s that commitment to inspire that enables all students to thrive. For that important gift, our nation couldn’t be more grateful.

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance. Fall is widely considered the best time of year to plant native trees, shrubs, grasses, vines and perennials.

"The benefits of trees Trees can provide many benefits in gardens and in urban environments. They produce fruit, like apples, peaches and figs, and also provide shade and wildlife habitat. Food forests support forest ecosystems and connect communities with nature. Trees of different sizes produce nuts and fruit, while their shade can support a variety of fresh, flavorful mushrooms, herbs, and berries. Trees also improve air quality and retain water.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Foreign Agricultural Service in  Trade  Apr 10,  For many American farms, the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree. The Robison and Stennes family orchards combined equal more than 200 years of growing apples in Washington. The Robison family has been growing apples in Chelan, Washington since the s. Today, Jake – the fourth generation of the Robison family – lives on the early-19th century plot that was used to grow some of the earliest apples to be harvested in Washington. “It’s fascinating that the land we are farming today has been used for apples since nearly the beginning of apple farming in the state of Washington – a unique piece of history,” said Jake Robison. The Stennes family has been growing apples in Pateros, Washington, for more than 130 years, and it continues to modernize its planting, crop management, and harvesting practices. “We’re using self-propelled worker platforms for more efficient work, using robotic harvesting prototypes. Plus, we just purchased our first electric and fully autonomous tractors,” Mark Stennes told FAS. Furthermore, the Stennes orchards have several hundred acres of certified organic production methods and practice Integrated Pest Management to minimize pesticide usage. The Pacific Northwest microclimate has enabled growers to experiment with this specialty crop. Robison Orchards produce a wide assortment of apple varieties. “We see Granny Smith, Honey Crisp, Cosmic Crisp, and other varieties as excellent options of high-quality apples for foreign markets,” said Dave Robison. “We just got to get them there.” Both family farms view the recent trade win of India reopening its market to U.S. apples as beneficial for apple farmers across Washington. The Washington Apple Commission (WAC) and FAS India worked together to regain market access for American apple growers. After retaliatory tariffs were lifted last summer, $10.8 million of U.S. apples were exported to India. This had an almost immediate impact for American apple growers; the market in India opened at the beginning of apple-picking season up in the Pacific Northwest. “Since the tariffs were imposed, other apple origins such as Turkey, Poland, and Iran, took control of the Indian market share, dropping the market share for Washington growers from 53 percent to less than 1 percent in 4 years,” Mark shared with FAS after traveling to India with the WAC in December. “Now that the tariff has been removed, we’ve seen Washington gain back some of the market share that was lost. India is now our fourth largest export market.” USDA is committed to strengthening U.S. exports of apples and other specialty crops. In , specialty crop exports totaled $24.6 billion. FAS is part of the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Initiative (SCCI), which identifies foreign market access and improves domestic production and processing practices. Growing and exporting Washington apples is a prime example of the future-facing American agriculture USDA is working with farmers to achieve. An example of this is FAS’s recently announced Assisting Specialty Crops Exports (ASCE) initiative, which will help expand specialty crop exports. ASCE investments will enable the specialty crops industry to address the many non-tariff barriers it faces when opening or expanding export markets.

Valentin was an intern with AMS for two years through the HACU National Internship Program. Photo Courtesy of Hakim Fobia, AMS Public Affairs Reach one, teach one. That is the approach that USDA has taken in its partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) National Internship Program. As a current employee with the USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) and a former HACU intern, I am glad to help continue this tradition. The HACU National Internship Program helps talented students in more than 400 colleges and universities gain valuable experience through paid internships at federal, private, and non-profit organizations. USDA has been a leading organization working with the program, hosting nearly HACU student interns since . I am part of the nearly 46% of former HACU interns who earned the opportunity to stay on board with the federal government after finishing my degree. I accepted the opportunity to continue my career at the USDA after two eventful summers interning with the AMS Commodity Procurement Program. During my tenure as an intern, I applied what I learned in my education and work experience. My time was spent helping develop and implement a new budget tracking system, overlooking a $2.6 million budget, developing budget procedures, and providing support to the daily branch operations. I also got a chance to help develop and implement a new invoicing process using the new Web Based Supply Chain Management System (WBSCM). The WBSCM is now used by AMS to make purchases for the National School Lunch Program and other federal nutrition assistance programs. As I look back on my experience as a HACU intern working at AMS, I really appreciate the way the program works with USDA and other organizations. After applying for the program through my school, the University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla Campus, HACU placed me in an organization and position that matched my educational background. Working with the Commodity Procurement staff turned out to be a great fit for me. AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo with students at the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event. Photo courtesy of Karen Comfort, AMS Special Assistant to the Administrator Looking to the future, I am confident that other HACU interns will have similar experiences at USDA and other partner organizations. I recently had the pleasure of attending the HACU National Internship Program summer farewell event where AMS Administrator Anne Alonzo inspired all. She gave the keynote address alongside Principal Deputy Under Secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs Robert L. Jesse. It was great to hear Administrator Alonzo encourage the interns to be fearless as they carve out their career paths. She also stressed that they can achieve anything when they are passionate about the fields they choose. I am glad to hear that my office will be welcoming two talented HACU interns this fall. I am excited to be able to share with them my positive experiences and encourage them to tell others about the program¡¯s success with AMS and other USDA agencies. I know that the internship will place them on track for long, fruitful careers and that they will help others follow in their footsteps.

The iconic nonprofit and social enterprise combats hunger and poverty through job training and job creation, providing hands-on culinary job training for individuals facing barriers to employment while creating living wage jobs and bringing nutritious food where it is most needed. DCCK¡¯s social ventures include serving scratch-cooked farm-to-school meals in DC schools, delivering fresh, affordable produce to corner stores in neighborhoods without supermarkets, and operating a fast-casual cafe.  ""Be the Rescue¡± is the simple motto of Food Rescue US. Their volunteers pick-up excess healthy food from local food donors then deliver it directly to local social service agencies that feed the food insecure. It goes like this -- local food donors (e.g., grocers, restaurants, caterers, farmers¡¯ markets, corporations, etc.) register available fresh food via an online tool. Next, local social service agencies (soup kitchens, shelters, veterans service facilities, etc.) respond with their food needs and details for delivery. Finally, local volunteers use the app to sign up for a ¡°food rescue¡± and schedule the pickup and delivery.","What are some ways in which the USDA Headquarters People's Garden addresses soil health, water quality, and wildlife habitat management?","The research conducted by Natalie Howe and her team at the Plant Materials Center helps gardeners, farmers, and ranchers manage their lands to benefit soil health, water quality, and wildlife habitat. The center also oversees the management of the Headquarters People's Garden, which showcases sustainable gardening practices such as composting and vermicomposting, reducing waste and promoting soil health."
"PhD, RDN, Director of Nutrition Security and Health Equity, USDA Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Equity  Mar 27,  USDA is proud to celebrate the second anniversary of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack¡¯s vision to advance food and nutrition security. This first-of-its-kind, whole-of-department approach uses a four-pillar approach, working across USDA¡¯s eight mission areas. These pillars include:  Providing nutrition support from pregnancy to birth and beyond;  Connecting everyone in this country with healthy, safe, affordable foods  Developing, translating, and enacting nutrition science through partnership; and  Prioritizing equity every step of the way. Leveraging the momentum of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, we are also doing our part to implement the National Strategy (, 201 ) on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. This whole-of-society strategy was designed to end hunger, improve nutrition and physical activity, and reduce diet-related diseases and disparities. And the Biden-Harris Administration remains focused on the Strategy. At a recent White House event, partners pledged nearly $1.7 billion in new commitments cultivated through the White House Challenge to End Hunger and Build Healthy Communities. Our efforts to advance food and nutrition security also integrates the Secretary¡¯s goal to make MyPlate a household name. As I explain in this video, MyPlate has been our national symbol for healthy eating for more than a decade. MyPlate.gov provides the guidance, tools, and resources that translate the - Dietary into actionable steps anyone can use. We are making our MyPlate materials more culturally, contextually, and linguistically responsive. And we work with more than rategic Partners across a variety of sectors to use common messages to communicate to consumers that it¡¯s never too early or too late to start eating healthy. We even launched a MyPlate Instagram, which is loaded with healthy eating tips and recipes. Agriculture Secretary Vilsack Celebrates Progress on Tackling Food and Nutrition Insecurity As we celebrate the power of nutritious food, we are proud of all we¡¯ve accomplished over the last two years, but we know we can do more and do better, together. Please explore our innovative tools and stay connected. We look forward to working together to help everyone in this country access nutrition education through MyPlate.

Unique Varieties at the Headquarters Garden Written by UW-Madison Department of Horticulture and Seed to Kitchen Collaborative There are many interesting varieties around the Headquarters People¡¯s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Visit the tabs below to learn more.  Plant Breeding 101  Have you ever been to the produce aisle and wondered how there got to be so many different types of lettuce? You might be surprised to learn that broccoli, kale, cabbage, and brussels sprouts all come from the exact same plant species. The incredible diversity of produce we have today has been developed over thousands of years, as plants evolved with and alongside humans. Early farmers and foragers would save seeds from plants that had desirable characteristics ¡ª like big fruits or big leaves, excellent flavor, or the ability to store over the winter¡ª and plant those seeds again in the spring, repeating the process season after season. Today, the science of selecting and reproducing certain plant traits is sometimes known as plant breeding.  There are several different ways of breeding plant varieties:  Open-pollinated varieties are those whose characteristics remain stable across generations. Older varieties, also known as heirlooms, are examples of open-pollinated varieties that can be saved in your garden from season to season. These varieties will continue to display the same characteristics of the previous generation. You can even select seeds with your own ideal traits!  Hybrid varieties are created by cross-pollinating two plants from different inbred lines. To develop hybrid varieties, breeders first take two populations of plants with desirable characteristics and reproduce them until the characteristics are stable. Then, they cross-pollinate the two populations to create an offspring that has the characteristics of both populations. Unlike seeds saved from open-pollinated varieties, seeds saved from hybrids often look very different from the parent plants, and instead display a wide diversity of traits that were present in the original populations.  Genetic engineering allows breeders to change individual traits in plant varieties by editing, inserting, or deleting gene sequences using different molecular techniques. There are not very many crops with genetically engineered varieties on the market today, although many are used in commercial farming of corn, soybeans, cotton, and sugar beets.  There are lots of interesting varieties around the People¡¯s Garden, and each one has a unique story about where it came from. Scan the QR code on the variety sign to learn more.  Beit Alfa Cucumber  Native to present day India and southern China, the cucumber has been a staple in Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines for thousands of years. Early cucumbers were likely quite bitter due to protective compounds in the cucumber skin which discourage insects and other pests from eating them. Over the years, plant breeders have selected varieties for less bitterness and better flavor, bringing to the table the cucumber we recognize today.  In the s, plant breeder Hanka Lazarson began working on an improved cucumber at the Beit Alfa kibbutz in northern Israel. She started with the local Damascus variety, which ¡°tasted good,¡± but produced cucumbers that were unevenly shaped and sized. So, she set out to develop a variety that was more uniform in appearance. As she worked to identify plants that made right-sized fruits, she realized that the increased uniformity also contributed to better flavor and texture. In a journal entry, she wrote, ¡°Our studies showed that if the cavity space of the cucumber is greater relative to the thickness of the shell. It has a juicier flavor and finer texture.¡±  The kibbutz knew they had a great cucumber on their hands, and in , Lazarson started distributing the seeds of the new variety in the Middle East, and quickly, around the world. Since then, hundreds of heirloom and hybrid varieties have counted Beit Alfa as an ancestor. Of the variety she¡¯d defined, she wrote: ¡°Productive variety, excellent taste and high yield: these indicate the type we called Beit Alfa Cucumber.¡±  Beit Alfa cucumbers are small, sweet, prolific, and can be harvested in short order, usually about 55 days from planting. Commonly referred to as a ¡°burpless¡± variety, Beit Alfas have thin skin, few seeds, and lower levels of cucurbitacin, the compound that made early cucumbers so bitter. They are also adaptable to many different growing environments, making them a popular choice among home gardeners.  Nativity Seeds, ¡°Damascus Cucumber To Beit Alfa Cucumber,¡±   Black Beauty Zucchini  The 20th century was a time of massive growth for the seed industry, which used snappy marketing to promote all types of new and interesting fruit and vegetable varieties. For all the pizzazz, it could be difficult for farmers and home gardeners to determine just which new varieties were actual improvements on the seeds they may have already had. Enter the All-America Selections, which rely on a panel of judges and controlled trials to determine the best new varieties on the market.  Black Beauty Zucchini is one such award winner, crowned in for being one of the earliest-ripening and longest-producing varieties of the dark-skinned zucchinis. Black Beauty was bred by John Scarchuk, a plant breeder at the University of Connecticut. Scarchuk received a degree in botany from UConn and began working for the University¡¯s Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station in . He served in the U.S. Army during World War II and returned to Storrs, where he spent the rest of his career. Each state has an Agricultural Experiment Station, designated and funded by the government to promote agricultural innovation across the country and to bring new and useful plant varieties to the American public. During his time at SAES, Scarchuk bred 7 All-America Selection winners, including Candlelight ornamental peppers, Dark Opal basil, and Table King squash. Of Black Beauty, the New York Times in wrote: ¡°This new variety with a heavier crop and longer season will bring added praise. Black Beauty can be picked when merely the size of a big dill pickle or when large as a cucumber. The flesh is tender, sweet, and buttery¡­ The more that is picked, the more that is produced.¡±  Hamilton, Robert. ¡°Tomorrow¡¯s Plants on 7 County Plots.¡± The New York Times,   Hastings, W. Ray. ¡°All-America Flowers Add Vegetables for ¡®57.¡± The New York Times,   P¨¢palo  While many of the fruits and vegetables we eat result from decades, and sometimes centuries, of breeding and selection, other foods on our plate are not that far removed from those we can find in the wild. Porophyllum ruderale is one of those species, a green herbaceous plant that grows extensively across the Americas, especially in disturbed soils.? Because the herb is used by many different cultures, it has many names, including summer cilantro, killi (from Quechua killki?a), cilantro boliviano, and yierba porosa, which refers in Spanish to the large pores on the leaves that release a strong smell when crushed. Perhaps its most common name in the United States, p¨¢palo, comes from the Nahuatl word for butterfly: papalotl. You may recognize other Nahuatl words in our culinary vocabulary, like xococatl (chocolate), tomatl, (tomato), ahuacatl (avocado), chian (chia), and even ch¨©llip¨­ctli (smoked chiles, or chipotle).  Indigenous Americans have used p¨¤palo for centuries as a flavorful, fresh addition to foods and as a medicinal herb, and its existence was an important part of the prehispanic diet. Many people still harvest p¨¢palo from wild sources or introduce it to certain locations, where it is left to establish itself. More recently, p¨¢palo also has been introduced as a cultivated crop on both small and large farms. Farmers who plant and tend p¨¢palo tend to favor plants that are shorter stature, less pungent, and have small, round, well-formed leaves, and the seeds from varieties that carry these characteristics are considered prime examples of the species. For this reason, cultivated p¨¢palo tends to be smaller and less fibrous than its wild relatives¨Ca reminder that humans and the foods we eat are constantly evolving with and alongside one another!

The Boss Pumpkin: An Interview with Plant Breeder Lindsay Wyatt  Anyone who has picked out a pumpkin for carving probably has ideas about what makes an excellent Jack O¡¯ Lantern: a perfect shape, dark orange coloring, maybe a nice, sturdy handle. When Johnny¡¯s Selected Seeds set out to develop a new Halloween pumpkin, plant breeder Lindsay Wyatt had her eye on many of those same things.  ¡°We take on yield and uniformity and color,¡± she said. ¡°The handles also have to be strong enough for someone to pick up a pumpkin by the handle and not break.¡± Importantly, she wanted to breed a pumpkin that was prolific enough for commercial growers to sell at the grocery store. ¡°But we also wanted a pumpkin that would be really nice and lovely for someone to grow in their garden for their kids to carve for Halloween,¡± she added.  At the Johnny¡¯s research farm in Maine, Wyatt and her team make over 70 new hybrid combinations every year, selecting the parent varieties that have desirable traits, and combining them via hand pollination. The next year, they grow the resulting hybrids to determine which combinations produce results that meet their goals. At harvest time, they invite the entire farm crew to walk the field and place a flag near their favorites, like an experimental pumpkin patch.  From the beginning, she knew one variety in particular would be a winner. ¡°It was so good the first year, we grew extra the next year to make sure it wasn¡¯t a fluke. It was almost hard to believe,¡± she said.  When it came time for the crew to place their votes, there were indeed a lot of flags clustered around one plot. The crew was so enthusiastic about the variety, they thought it should have a name that recognized it for being outstanding in the field. ¡°Someone basically said, we should name it The Boss,¡± she laughed. ¡°And we were all like, yeah, that¡¯s the name now.¡±  And where did The Boss get its good looks? Wyatt nods to the late University of New Hampshire professor Dr. Brent Loy, who developed over 80 squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin varieties over his long career. ¡°One of those lines is a big part of The Boss¡¯ genetics,¡± she said. ¡°So this definitely would not be possible without public plant breeding.¡±  Herself an alumna of a public plant breeding program, Wyatt originally studied biology in college before learning about the Plant Breeding Department at Cornell University. Growing up, she had worked summers in her father¡¯s nursery and always wondered where all the different colored petunias came from, but it wasn¡¯t until she started looking for graduate school programs that she realized there was a dedicated field of study for creating new and interesting plant varieties.  As for how she made the leap from petunias to pumpkins, she chalked it up to serendipity and the projects available at Cornell and later, at Johnny¡¯s Seeds. ¡°And then,¡± she added, ¡°I find that once you start working with any crop, you start to love it.¡±  Berkeley Tie Dye Tomato: An Interview with Plant Breeder Brad Gates  If you¡¯re lucky enough to visit a Berkeley Tie Dye plant when it¡¯s fruiting, it may be obvious how this pink and yellow and green-striped tomato came by its name. In fact, according to tomato breeder Brad Gates, the exchange that dubbed this famous heirloom went down with no words at all.  ¡°I was selling tomatoes at the farmers¡¯ market in Oakland, about a mile from Berkeley, and a guy wearing a tie-dye shirt came over and held the tomato to the middle of his chest. He gave me this funny look like, ¡®Hey, it looks just like my shirt...¡¯ I didn¡¯t realize what a pivotal scene was playing out in those few seconds.¡±  Now, Berkeley Tie Dye is known around the world for its groovy looks and gourmet flavor. But when Gates started selling tomatoes, he didn¡¯t even know just how much diversity existed in the crop.  ¡°I started working on a Saturday for a friend doing the farmers market about 25 years ago,¡± he said. ¡°I was expecting to show up and have all these red tomatoes to sell. But there were all these yellow and pink and purple ones and people were asking questions about them. I had to force myself to step outside my comfort zone and start tasting them.¡±  The experience had so intrigued Gates that he decided to grow tomatoes full-time. He started with dozens of heirloom varieties to find the tomatoes that grew well, tasted good, and produced prolifically. ¡°We would get left with a bunch of them at the farmers market and others would sell out,¡± he said. Naturally, he began saving seeds from the varieties that did well.  ¡°With heirloom varieties, you can save your own seeds,¡± he said. And because tomatoes are self-pollinating, you¡¯ll often get a similar tomato year after year. ¡°But once in a great while, you¡¯ll get a natural cross-pollination, and a couple of plants show up that aren¡¯t what they¡¯re supposed to be.¡± As he was growing thousands and thousands of plants for the market, Gates took some of the new crosses he was seeing and began to grow them out, too. ¡°And that was how I got into breeding tomatoes,¡± he said.  Fortunately for the world he did, because he was just about ready to hang up his farmer¡¯s hat and get a different job. But as he saw people¡¯s reactions to the new varieties he was breeding, he decided to stick with it. ¡°I had the thought, ¡®At one point, I¡¯m the only person in the world holding Berkeley Tie Dye.¡¯ And every restaurant I go to, everyone says, ¡®Wow, these tomatoes are amazing. So I was thinking, ¡®Well, the world shouldn¡¯t be without this.¡¯¡±  Gates sells mostly seeds and seedlings now, and you can find varieties he¡¯s bred in farms and gardens from sea level to seven thousand feet. In fact, he says, when someone grows open-pollinated seeds and saves them from year-to-year, they¡¯re creating adaptation to challenging environments.  The diversity preserved in the process will ensure that people can feed themselves in all these different places, he added. ¡°I¡¯ve had people tell me that one of my varieties was the last producing tomato plant in a summer in Tucson, and I¡¯ve had people have good results growing close to the San Francisco Bay, where it¡¯s always cool and foggy.¡±  ¡°Having diverse genetics and being able to select again and again in your area, it¡¯s one of the best things for people who want to grow a garden,¡± he said. ¡°It doesn¡¯t take a white coat and a biology degree. Even a home gardener can grow something unknown or something special that you can¡¯t get at the store.¡±  All it takes, according to Gates, ¡°is common sense and determination to grow a decent number of plants for a decent number of years.¡±","This article features two plant breeders, Dr. Brent Loy and Brad Gates, who have developed new varieties of squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin, as well as tomatoes. The article highlights the importance of public plant breeding in developing new crop varieties, citing Dr. Loy's work on over 80 different lines. It also features an interview with Brad Gates, a tomato breeder who has developed several new heirloom tomato varieties, including the famous ""Berkeley Tie Dye"" tomato. Gates recounts how he started selling tomatoes at farmers' markets and was surprised to find a wide diversity of colors and flavors in the crop. He began saving seeds from the varieties that did well and eventually started breeding his own tomatoes. His work on heirloom tomatoes led him to develop new varieties, such as Berkeley Tie Dye, which is prized for its unique appearance and flavor. The article also touches on the importance of preserving genetic diversity in crops, particularly through open-pollination and seed saving. Gates notes that when people save seeds from year to year, they create adaptation to challenging environments and ensure that there will always be diverse genetics available for future generations. Some key points from the interview with Brad Gates include: * The importance of public plant breeding in developing new crop varieties * The diversity of heirloom tomatoes and the potential for creating new varieties through breeding * The value of preserving genetic diversity through open-pollination and seed saving * The ability of home gardeners to grow unique or special varieties of plants using saved seeds * The importance of determination and common sense in growing a decent number of plants over several years.","There is no mention of Dr. Brent Loy, a plant breeder who has developed new varieties of squash, gourd, melon, and pumpkin, in the provided article text.

"FNS Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Mar 10,  This past February, I attended the Urban School Food Alliance winter meeting in Los Angeles, California, which included Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) sessions focused on child nutrition programs. Participants, which included food service directors from around the country, had the opportunity to ask questions about the child nutrition programs they administer, including the recent updates. Engaging with program leaders and seeing what child nutrition programs look like ¡®on the ground¡¯ is important to us. In addition to learning from the group, the meeting was a reminder of the many partners we have that share a common goal of continuing to elevate the role that healthy meals play in schools and for our children¡¯s future. We spent a day at the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) observing their warehouse and kitchen operations, and meeting with school officials. We also got a taste of the delicious meals LAUSD prepares for students. California was one of the first states to implement a statewide Universal Meals Program for all school children after the expiration of federal waivers during COVID, which allowed states to serve school meals at no cost to students. I commend the California state legislature and all state, county, and local anti-hunger advocates that helped to make this happen.

"Posted by the Food and Nutrition Service's Western Regional Office in  Food and Nutrition  Aug 02,  The first week of August, farmers markets across the nation celebrate National Farmers Market Week, highlighting their role in supporting healthy communities, food systems and stimulating local economies. Throughout the pandemic, farmers markets and USDA partners worked hard to remain safe, accessible outlets for healthy food, as well as a vital marketing outlet for small and mid-sized farmers. Farmers markets put rigorous safety plans in place and the Ecology Center fought to ensure that farmers markets were classified as essential businesses while sharing best practices around pandemic response with the broader farmers market community.

"Acting Deputy Chief, Forest Service Research and Development in  Forestry  Oct 04,  Access to high-quality water will be a defining feature of the 21st century. Record heat waves and drought are not only leading to more frequent and intense wildfires but are also putting one of life¡¯s most valuable resources at risk: the water we drink. A new Forest Service research report describes how extensively public drinking water systems rely on national forests and grasslands. Water use per person has been declining for decades; however, a variety of factors such as population growth, food production and ecosystem conditions under a changing climate are contributing to overall greater demand for water ¨C especially in certain parts of the country. In the West, national forests and grasslands supply drinking water to almost 90% of the people served by public water systems. Some western cities, like Aspen, Colorado, and Portland, Oregon, are more than 90% dependent on national forests alone for their drinking water. The story is similar in the eastern U.S., though most of this water is supplied by private forests. Still, more than a century of research has demonstrated that forested lands provide the cleanest and most stable water supply compared to other lands. Within the lower 48 states, more than 99% of people who rely on public drinking water receive some from forested lands. This report is the first of its kind to measure how individual national forests and grasslands contribute to surface drinking water supplies while accounting for networks of pipelines and canals that divert water from the source to areas of high need, also known as ¡°inter-basin water transfers.¡± These inter-basin transfers are incredibly important sources of drinking water, especially in the West, where cities like Los Angeles receive more than two-thirds of their water from forested lands in California and Colorado. By showing where our drinking water comes from at a fine scale, this report supports USDA¡¯s Wildfire Crisis Strategy, and work supported by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act. It helps land managers prioritize forests and watersheds for hazardous fuels reduction, watershed management, and restoration treatments that protect people, communities and resources across the country.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Sep 06,  The transition from military to civilian life can be challenging, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Military Veteran Agricultural Liaison (MVAL) offers assistance to veterans that can lead to permanent employment or help in starting an agriculture-related business. After 23 years in the Army, retired Major Gloria Cirulli, former Inspector General, found her new mission serving her country as a regional hiring coordinator with the U.S. Forest Service. She learned about USDA opportunities through the Department of Defense (DOD) SkillBridge program, which allows service members to gain civilian work experience during their last 180 days of active duty. For potential employers, DOD SkillBridge creates opportunities to access and leverage the world's most highly trained and motivated workforce at no cost. As a result of DOD SkillBridge, Cirulli reached out to several federal agencies about career opportunities, and one of the responses she received was from USDA MVAL Monshi ¡°Ram¡± Ramdass. The MVAL helps connect veterans with federal and civilian agricultural programs and information about how veterans¡¯ education benefits can be used to start careers in agriculture. The MVAL also advocates on behalf of veterans in interactions with USDA staff to ensure that personnel understand the proper implementation of new veteran farmer programs. ¡°We discussed my resume and background over the phone, and Ram said he would share my resume with USDA agencies,¡± said Cirulli. ¡°He called me back and let me know that Forest Service Program Manager Deborah Beighley would be in touch.¡± Beighley, who works on the agency¡¯s Recruitment and Talent Acquisition Management Team, has tapped into DOD SkillBridge to recruit and hire interns and new employees. ¡°I¡¯m a believer in the program¡¯s potential benefits for both the interns and the agency,¡± she said. ¡°We¡¯ve already onboarded two additional interns and are in the process of onboarding one more!¡± ¡°We were looking for someone skilled in project management who could navigate and build connections, someone who would bring a fresh, outside perspective to the work we were doing,¡± she continued. ¡°Gloria did all that and more.

Mushrooms with names like ¡°chicken in the woods¡± are popular with attendees to the Girdwood Fungus Fair on the Glacier Ranger District in August, and the Cordova Fungus Festival on the Cordova Ranger District in September. During the Girdwood festival, Mohatt addressed the competiveness of mushroom hunters and their desire to keep their best hunting spots secret. She also described how to find those special mushrooms that can be worked into culinary masterpieces and how to avoid those that can cause gastrointestinal distress ¨C or worse. The festival included mushroom hikes and dye-making classes. A Fungus Fair Formal was held in the Alyeska Resort Ballroom with a five-course gourmet meal highlighting and featuring different ways of using and enjoying mushrooms.

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  Mar 02,  FSA Administrator Val Dolcini speaks at the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic. I recently attended the National Pheasant Fest and Quail Classic in Des Moines, Iowa, where I met with sportsmen, farmers, young people, wildlife biologists and others who are committed to strengthening wildlife habitat throughout America. It was exciting to see firsthand the passion for the native and restored grasslands and woodlands that typify the rural American landscape. I had the honor of speaking to the group, where I highlighted the 30th anniversary of USDA¡¯s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).? CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, is designed to reduce soil erosion, improve water and air quality, and provide habitat for wildlife. Interested landowners can establish long-term USDA-approved grasses or trees in exchange for USDA helping with the cost of establishing the plants and providing annual payments for 10 to 15 years. The covers along fields, streams and rivers prevent soil and nutrients from washing into waterways, reduce soil erosion that may otherwise contribute to poor air and water quality, and provide valuable habitat for wildlife. Since its enactment in , CRP has prevented more than 8 billion tons of soil from eroding, protected more than 170,000 stream miles with riparian and grass buffers, and provided more than 100,000 acres of bottomland hardwood trees and nearly 300,000 acres of flood-plain wetlands.? It has also created more than 250,000 acres each for duck nesting habitat and upland bird habitat. Although this is a federal program, this 30-year record of accomplishment was not achieved by USDA alone.? Partnerships with state, local, and nongovernmental organizations are the foundation upon which these important achievements have been built. Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever¡¯s President and Chief Executive Officer (left) and FSA Administrator Val Dolcini sign an agreement establishing a framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including Farm Service Agency and Natural Resources Conservation Service, to maintain and enhance the productivity of pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitats on private and public lands. That¡¯s why I joined Howard Vincent, Pheasant Forever and Quail Forever¡¯s President and Chief Executive Officer, in signing an agreement to continue the longtime framework of cooperation between Pheasants Forever and USDA agencies, including the Farm Service Agency (FSA) and the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), to maintain and enhance pheasant, quail, and other wildlife habitat on private and public lands.? These joint efforts include habitat conservation and restoration, scientific assistance, educational materials, and research collaboration. In addition, this five-year commitment helps support Pheasants Forever¡¯s Farm Bill biologist program at local USDA offices nationwide. Given the strong relationships Pheasants Forever has with farmers and ranchers across the country, including their significant contribution toward the successful sage grouse and lesser prairie chicken initiatives launched by USDA, we are pleased to renew our partnership. On behalf of my colleagues at USDA, I want to thank everyone who plays a role in making conservation programs like CRP so successful, and for helping make rural America, with its diverse flora and fauna, its abundant natural resources and its beautiful natural landscapes, better than we have ever known. CRP was made possible through the Farm Bill. To learn more about the Farm Bill or the Conservation Reserve Program please visit www.usda.gov/farmbill or www.fsa.usda.gov/conservation.

"KY Rural Development, Public Information Coordinator in  Rural  Aug 22,   Dozens of people gathered in Monticello, Ky., on Wednesday to break ground on a project in which five local families began the process of building their own homes. Great partnerships can lead to great projects ¨C and this event highlighted several strategic partners that worked incredibly hard to make it happen, including USDA Rural Development, Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation, Southern Tier Housing Corporation, the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises (FAHE) and the families of Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Yvonne Hernandez, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. Five families will become homeowners thanks to Rural Development¡¯s Mutual Self-Help and 502 Direct Loan programs. The families, from left, are Yvonne Hernandez, Pedro and Omaira Ruiz, Mary and Silvino Castillo, Brenda McGuire and Patsy Perdue. This project began several years ago when Kentucky Highlands received a Rural Development Section 523 Mutual Self Help Housing grant for $250,000 in April . That money was designated for technical assistance to help 12 families that wanted to help build new homes. The selected families also were approved for Rural Development 502 Direct Loan funds, in addition to forgivable loans from FAHE, to pay for the cost of building the homes. The self-help housing ¡°sweat equity¡± concept is not new. Organized self-help housing started with the Quakers a number of years ago. This became a tradition of rural people, who had the determination and help of neighbors, to construct barns, homes and schools that became American¡¯s rural communities. The Section 523 program is used primarily to help very low and low-income households build their own homes and is targeted to families who are unable to buy clean, safe housing through conventional methods. Families participating in a mutual self-help project perform approximately 65 percent of the construction labor on each other¡¯s homes under qualified supervision, and the reduced labor costs make it easier for the families to own a home. Another great advantage of this program is that mortgage payments can be ¡°rolled into¡± the loan for families who can¡¯t afford to make them while the house is being built.

"Administrator, Farm Service Agency in  Conservation  May 01,   Farmers and ranchers were among the first to practice conservation. It¡¯s not surprising when you think about it. They¡¯ve always understood the importance of caring for our land and water, and they depend on our natural resources for their livelihoods. They¡¯re at the forefront of our country¡¯s efforts to keep the land healthy, productive and resilient. And we¡¯re proud to partner with them in that effort. This year, we¡¯re celebrating two more conservation milestones: the 30th anniversary of USDA¡¯s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation; and registering the 1 millionth acre in CRP¡¯s State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE) initiative. The 1 millionth acre is part of the Coteau-Drift SAFE, located in North Dakota. The state has a total of four SAFE projects, covering over 122,000 acres.? The projects are helping a wide range of species ¨C from pheasants, grouse, prairie-chicken, grey partridge, deer and other game animals ¨C flourish and grow. The Coteau-Drift SAFE is designed to register more than 69,000 acres in the state¡¯s Missouri Plateau and Drift Prairie region to support waterfowl, shorebirds and terrestrial birds.? Through SAFE, state agencies, nonprofit conservation organizations, and even local groups work together to identify at-risk wildlife, and to submit proposals to USDA for review.? Once approved, agricultural producers within an approved SAFE area can voluntarily enroll acres in 10 to 15 year contracts. In exchange, USDA provides annual rental payments, incentives, and cost-share assistance for establishing plant species that attract wildlife. There are now 98 SAFE habitat partnerships in 37 states and Puerto Rico. And the numbers don¡¯t end there. Each year, through CRP programs, we work with hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers to implement voluntary conservation practices on their operations. CRP, one of the largest private lands conservation programs in the nation, provides significant economic and environmental benefits to hundreds of rural communities. CRP initiatives, like SAFE, encourage federal, state and local partnerships, showing us that when we all work together, everyone benefits. Visit www.fsa.usda.gov/conservation to learn more about our conservation efforts and how you can be part of the movement.? Farmers and ranchers who want to offer land in SAFE and CRP can contact a local FSA county office.

"Farm Service Agency Administrator in  Conservation  Nov 13,  Sample FSA County Committee election ballot. This is a great time of the year for the Farm Service Agency (FSA), not just because of another successful American harvest, but because of the opportunity for agricultural communities throughout the country to vote for officials to represent them on FSA County Committees. In my first year as FSA Administrator, I¡¯ve traveled to 32 states and visited with farmers and ranchers from California to Maine. I know firsthand the impact of successfully delivered farm programs in rural communities all across this great nation. Working with county committee members while serving as FSA state executive director for California and now as Administrator, I have a deep appreciation for the essential role these farmer-elected committees play in connecting FSA with the needs of local producers. County committees have been making a difference for producers for more than eight decades.? They were originally established back in to ensure that local producers could provide input to the federal programs that offered financial assistance to farmers.? Today, nearly 7,700 FSA county committee members serve nationwide by applying their knowledge and judgment to make important decisions on commodity support programs, conservation programs, indemnity and disaster programs, emergency programs and eligibility.? Each county committee has three to 11 elected members who serve three-year terms and one-third of county committee seats are up for election each year. Producers elected to committees have always played a vital role in local agricultural decisions. They are essential to the daily operation of nearly 2,200 offices across the country. It is a valued partnership that helps us better understand the needs of the farmers and ranchers we serve. That is why I am encouraging all eligible producers to vote during this year¡¯s county committee elections. Through your vote, you are selecting someone from your county who will provide critical local input on FSA programs.? The elections began Nov. 9, with the mailing of ballots to all eligible producers. Ballots must be completed and returned to the county office or postmarked by Dec. 7 to be counted. Voters who did not receive a ballot this week can pick one up at their local FSA office. To learn more, visit www.fsa.usda.gov/elections.? Make your vote count!

As rural communities search for new and viable economic approaches, it is becoming clear that one core component of many successful rural communities is the presence of vibrant arts and cultural opportunities. Last month I had the opportunity to speak about rural arts initiatives and how USDA Rural Development is engaged with local communities and private foundations to provide awareness of our infrastructure programs and how they can assist in supporting local cultural strategies. At the Americans for the Arts annual meeting I had the honor of representing USDA on two panels where our Rural Development programs were part of the mix.? The sessions included discussion of ArtPlace, a consortium of national and regional foundations, and their efforts to support rural communities. Projects in Lanesboro, Minnesota and Ajo, Arizona are recent ArtPlace grantees, and we had the opportunity to explore ways in which USDA¡¯s infrastructure programs might be able to leverage this new boost of philanthropic support as these communities work to demonstrate how cultural development is an essential ingredient for rural communities in the next generation. One recent example demonstrating strategic alignment between foundations and USDA is an artist housing project in downtown Minot, North Dakota.?? The Magic City Lofts received an ArtPlace grant in to help complete construction of the building.? And this June, one of the new tenants in the building, the Turtle Mountain Tribal Arts Association received a $97,000 USDA Rural Business Enterprise Grant for technical assistance associated with establishing a storefront gallery for tribal artists in the new building. The conference also allowed USDA to discuss our various programs and those of other federal agencies.? Our ongoing collaboration with the Partnership for Sustainable Communities is one way the Obama Administration is supporting rural areas. Last year¡¯s Rural Jobs Accelerator grants were a call to promote regional approaches to economic development, and one of the successful grantees involved a regional cultural strategy in SW Virginia centered on the Crooked Road Heritage Trail.? The project involved funding from USDA, the Economic Development Administration, and the Appalachian Regional Commission. Construction continues at the Sonoran Desert Retreat Center in Ajo, Arizona which was a recent recipient of an ArtPlace grant from national foundations. USDA has also provided funding to the Center over the years, including a community facility grant for the courtyard garden in foreground. Photo courtesy of Tracy Taft. A similar set of conversations was had at the Rural Arts and Culture Summit in Morris, Minnesota where the Center for Small Towns at the University of Minnesota-Morris, played a gracious host.?? Organized by Springboard for the Arts¡¯ field office in Fergus Falls, this remarkable gathering involved over 200 arts leaders focused on ensuring that rural arts and culture remain a viable component of the state¡¯s rural communities.? The Summit was another example of how philanthropies, such as the McKnight and Mardag foundations, are key partners in supporting the rural cultural economy. One project that caught my eye was the Franconia Sculpture Park in Taylors Falls, Minnesota.? ?Visiting Franconia is a remarkable experience.?? Artists-in-Residents use their time onsite to build large sculptures that are then placed on display for free public viewing on a 20 acre site amidst the farmland.? Franconia, and its employees and artist residents, though more importantly its thousands of visitors, provide a noteworthy boost to the rural communities of Taylors Falls, MN and St Croix Falls, WI, the latter of which is home to a vibrant local performance theater, the St Croix Festival Theater. ??These engaging destinations struck me a wonderful places to help urban visitors gain a greater appreciation of how cultural enterprises help sustain rural communities. ¡°Franconia Sculpture Park in Taylors Falls, MN is a jewel amidst the farms and provides extra economic boost to the surrounding rural communities as well as cultural enrichment to both local residents and visitors from the Twin Cities.¡± Photo courtesy of Franconia Sculpture Park.

"In Charles City Iowa, USDA Officials Listen to Advice from Business Leaders at White House Roundtable Event  Access to capital, cutting edge technology and more responsive government programs will help drive rural innovation, according to participants at a White House Business Council roundtable in Charles City, Iowa yesterday. Facilitated by USDA Rural Utilities Service (RUS) Administrator Jonathan Adelstein, the forum drew a group of rural business leaders from around the region. They raised issues ranging from the length of time it takes to process passport and visa applications to new regulations on banks and financial institutions. Adelstein, who is one of the Obama Administration¡¯s leading advocates for rural broadband, heard an extensive discussion of the shortcomings of rural broadband in Charles City. At the same time, rural telephone cooperatives described their success working with RUS to improve their systems. Charles City Mayor Jim Erb told Adelstein there exists a ¡°rural-rural¡± divide in which some communities receive exceptional broadband service while others do not.

"The Program The Farm Bill created the Program to help underserved farmers, ranchers and foresters who have historically experienced limited access to USDA programs and services. The Farm Bill expanded the Program to include veterans. The objective of the Program is to show USDA¡¯s commitment to ensuring that underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters can equitably participate in USDA programs. Grants are awarded to community-based and non-profit organizations, higher education institutions and eligible tribal entities with at least 3 years of experience in working with socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers or veteran farmers and ranchers. Individual farmers and ranchers are not eligible to apply for Program grants. Because of differences in demographics, culture, economics, language and other factors, there is no one single approach to identifying solutions that can benefit underserved and veteran farmers, ranchers and foresters. Program partners are based in local communities and rural areas where they serve a critical role in maximizing USDA¡¯s outreach efforts by identifying systemic barriers that need to be removed and working to increase equitable participation in USDA¡¯s programs and services. Projects funded under the Program include, but are not limited to, conferences, workshops and demonstrations on various farming techniques and other efforts to connect underserved farmers and ranchers to USDA local officials to help communities increase their awareness of USDA¡¯s programs and services.

Do foods like pumpkin, apples, soups, casseroles and baked goods come to mind? Here are four recipe ideas to bring nutrition and seasonal flavors to your table:  Roasted Root Vegetables: This recipe is packed with fiber, vitamins and minerals. Get potassium from the potatoes and rutabaga, vitamin C from the turnips and sweet potatoes, and vitamin A from the carrots and sweet potatoes.  Lentil Soup: Warm up with soup as the weather gets cooler. One cup of cooked lentils provides nearly 18 grams of plant protein and 16 grams of fiber to help keep you full between meals.  Pumpkin Pancakes: Pumpkin is a fall favorite for kids and adults! These pancakes use one cup of whole wheat flour to add more fiber compared to all-purpose (white) flour alone. Try topping them with yogurt, fruit or nuts.  Banana Oatmeal Cookies: Baking is a fun family activity, especially when it is too chilly to get outside. With no added sugar, these cookies are sweetened naturally from bananas and raisins, which also provide potassium. These recipes are just some of the many flavorful and nutritious options that could be enjoyed this fall.

"ARS Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Jan 17,  It may be winter, but it is still possible to access fresh, locally-grown produce. How? With aquaponics. Americans and people living around the world can grow crops year-round in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of their regions¡¯ climate or season. It also has the added benefit of supplying fresh fish to the local food system. ¡°Aquaponics is a blend of aquaculture and hydroponics, and is the most rapidly growing segment of global agriculture,¡± said Carl Webster, research biologist at the Agricultural Research Service¡¯s (ARS) Harry K. Dupree Stuttgart National Aquaculture Research Center in Arkansas. The aquaponics system begins with tanks where fish are grown ¨C usually tilapia, channel catfish, and hybrid striped bass. In these tanks, bacteria breaks down fish waste (feces and ammonia) into natural fertilizer. Farmers then irrigate their plants with this fertilizer in a hydroponic growing chamber. Plants raised using aquaponics typically include crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers. The result of aquaponics is a steady supply of fresh fish and vegetables that are available in local communities throughout the year and are grown in just about any environment ¨C from an abandoned inner-city warehouse to a climate-controlled facility in the middle of a desert. Additionally, aquaponics does not just benefit local communities; it also serves as an innovative and invaluable tool in addressing some of the world¡¯s most pressing challenges like hunger and climate change. ¡°According to the United Nations, there will be more than 9 billion people living on our planet by . We need to be smarter about how we grow food,¡± said Benjamin Beck, research leader at the ARS Aquatic Animal Health Research unit in Auburn, Alabama. ¡°Minimizing the space used to grow food and/or growing more than one crop at the same time could help relieve pressure on land production of crops while still providing a locally-grown source of food.¡±  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  Agricultural Research Service  ARS  USDA Science  fish  aquaculture  hydroponics  aquaponics  sustainable farming  You May Also Like  USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians¡¯ Engines  Meet Mari Gomez¡ªPublic Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community  Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",What are some innovative ways to grow crops year-round in various environments using aquaponics systems?,"* Growing crops like lettuce, spinach, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and peppers * Minimizing space used to grow food by growing multiple crops at the same time * Growing crops in a soilless hydroponic environment regardless of climate or season * Using abandoned inner-city warehouses or climate-controlled facilities in deserts as aquaponics systems"
"Posted by Agricultural Research Service Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Nov 23,  For many families, a Thanksgiving meal would not be the same without the sweet, tart goodness of cranberry dishes. A project funded by USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) at Oregon State University (OSU) is working to ensure that staple stays on the table. ¡°Weeds ¨C moss in particular ¨C are a big challenge to cranberry production, but the number of herbicides labeled for use on cranberry is relatively low,¡± said Cassie Bouska, associate professor of practice with OSU Extension Service. ¡°We lack effective controls for weeds that can, and ultimately will, take over a cranberry bed and drastically reduce production.¡± Research from Washington state found that increasing moss pressure reduced yield by at least half. With decreased cranberry yields and lower prices, some growers have struggled to break even in recent years.  ¡°That impacts the economic stability of farm families and rural communities,¡± Bouska said. ¡°An economically sustainable farm can move forward and find ways to improve its environmental sustainability.¡± A cranberry bed is a complete mat of cranberry vines ¨C 100% ground cover. Established weeds are difficult to control and hand weeding is time-consuming and expensive. As a result, the research team is studying various weed control tools and techniques to tackle troublesome weeds and may be closing in on a breakthrough. ¡°We¡¯ve tested some products that are very effective at controlling moss, while causing minimal or no damage to the cranberries,¡± Bouska said. ¡°Next year¡¯s field work will provide indications of whether there are additive effects of year-on-year applications. We¡¯re optimistic that we have some good candidates.¡±  Ensuring farming stays viable and profitable for our producers is essential.

"Release & Contact Info  Fact Sheet  Release No. .21  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  On November 2, at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), the United States and United Arab Emirates officially launched the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate (AIM for Climate) alongside 31 countries and over 48 non-government partners. In remarks at the World Leaders Summit, President Biden announced that the United States intends to mobilize $1 billion in investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years . Previewed at President Biden¡¯s Leaders Summit on Climate in April, AIM for Climate is a pioneering initiative uniquely focused on increasing investment and enabling greater public-private and cross-sectoral partnerships, intended to both raise global climate ambition, and underpin transformative climate action in the agriculture sector in all countries. AIM for Climate has already begun to bear fruit, garnering an ¡°early harvest¡± of $4 billion in increased investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over five years. AIM for Climate partners are mobilizing this investment to close the global investment gap in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Climate-smart agriculture is an approach that helps to guide actions needed to transform and reorient agricultural systems to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes, while adapting and building resilience to climate change and/or reducing/removing greenhouse gas emissions. AIM for Climate seeks to create incentives for, and mechanisms for maximizing the impact of, new investments toward an agriculture sector that is ready to face a changing climate. Government partners are providing the crucial foundation of AIM for Climate, through a wave of public investment in climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation. Other sectors, including business, philanthropy, and other non-government partners are invited to build upon that foundation with ¡°innovation sprints¡± ¨C investments in specific, impactful, measurable, expedited efforts ¨C or by providing critical knowledge for identifying investment gaps, challenges, and opportunities. AIM for Climate has three primary objectives:  Demonstrate collective commitment to significantly increase investment in agricultural innovation for climate-smart agriculture and food systems over five years ;  Support frameworks and structures to enable technical discussions and the promotion of expertise, knowledge, and priorities across international and national levels of innovation to amplify the impact of participants¡¯ investments; and  Establish appropriate structures for exchanges between Ministers, chief scientists, and other stakeholders as key focal points and champions for cooperation on climate-related agricultural innovation, to engender greater co-creation and cooperation on shared research priorities. AIM for Climate focuses on increasing and accelerating investment in, and other support for, climate-smart agricultural innovation in the areas of:  Scientific breakthroughs via basic agricultural research through national-level government and academic research institutions;  Public and private applied research, including through support to international research centers, institutions, and laboratory networks; and  Development, demonstration, and deployment of practical, actionable, and innovative products, services, and knowledge to producers and other market participants, including through national agricultural research extension systems. AIM for Climate government partners announced at COP26 include:  Government Partners  Azerbaijan  Australia  Bahamas  Bangladesh  Brazil  Burkina Faso  Canada  Colombia  Denmark  Finland  Georgia  Ghana  Honduras  Hungary  Ireland  Japan  Kenya  Republic of Korea  Israel  Lithuania  Mexico  Morocco  New Zealand  Philippines  Romania  Singapore  Sweden  United States  United Arab Emirates  United Kingdom  Uruguay  Ukraine  Vietnam A full list of partners and more information on AIM for Climate is available at www.aimforclimate.org. Participation in AIM for Climate is voluntary. Joining AIM for Climate as a Government, Innovation Sprint, or Knowledge Partner does not imply? endorsement of or partnership between the participants; rather it entails an intention to support the goal and objectives of AIM for Climate.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Office of Partnerships and Public Engagement in  Equity  Initiatives  Oct 11,  Georgia native Topeka Ham found a new calling serving the American public through the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) after 26 years in the South Carolina Air National Guard. ¡°I helped fulfill my mother¡¯s dream of joining the Air Force by becoming the first military enlistee in my immediate family,¡± said Ham. ¡°I wanted to continue government service after I retired, and the doors opened in an area that I didn¡¯t even know existed.¡± As her Air Force career began winding down, she began looking into opportunities to continue her federal career in the civilian sector. She reached out to the USDA¡¯s Military Veteran Agricultural Liaison (MVAL), Monshi ¡°Ram¡± Ramdass. ¡°I sent my resume, and within an hour I was contacted about an opportunity with the Agricultural Research Service in South Carolina,¡± said Ham. ¡°Ram told me about the SkillBridge program, where I was approved by my military supervisor to intern for four months with the research facility. I was blessed and offered a permanent full-time job.¡± The Department of Defense¡¯s SkillBridge program allows transitioning veterans to receive their military paycheck while interning with USDA across the U.S. and/or at USDA headquarters in Washington, D.C. to gain valuable civilian work experience. Ham says her military experience, where she honed her administrative and multitasking skills, helped prepare her for her current position as a program support assistant at the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Coastal Plains, Soil, Water and Plant Conservation Research in South Carolina, which she now calls her work family. James Dann, Administrative Officer for the ARS, connected with Ram for help in filling USDA positions vacated during the pandemic. Dann knew USDA had a Military Veteran Agricultural Liaison from word of mouth, so he reached out about hiring veterans. ¡°Through Ram¡¯s assistance, I have successfully hired three veterans, including Topeka, utilizing the Veteran Recruitment Appointment Authority hiring process,¡± said Dann. ¡°All three candidates are on track to have successful and rewarding careers with USDA.¡± As the MVAL, Ram can assist veterans and military spouses by connecting them with opportunities available through the USDA Veterans Employment Program and the Military Spouse Employment Program, helping them to align their skills, knowledge and career goals with an USDA occupation and agency. Veterans can contact their supervisor or the USDA Target Center for reasonable accommodation needs upon employment.

"USDA, FNS and written by Hannah Benson, Project Bread Program Manager in  Food and Nutrition  Mar 08,  Several studies consistently link poor access to food to poor health outcomes, including heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Project Bread, a Massachusetts¡¯ nonprofit focused on permanently solving food insecurity, teamed up with MassHealth to pilot the Flexible Services Program, or FSP, to bolster food security and meet nutritional needs from birth throughout childhood and beyond, improving health outcomes at every stage of life. Since April , over 7,000 MassHealth members (ranging in age from 0 months to 64 years) with complex health issues were given an array of food resources, including gift cards for groceries, cooking supplies, refrigerators, cooking classes, transportation assistance, and nutrition education. A recent evaluation of 491 clients, who engaged in the program between November ¨C October , significantly improved their diet and health as follows:  25% became food secure  Fruit and vegetable consumption increased by 3.5 servings per week  SNAP enrollment increased by 12.4%  99% reported that participation in FSP improved their health Project Bread employs 11 nutrition services coordinators to serve MassHealth clients across several languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Cape Verdean Creole, Haitian Creole, Arabic, and Vietnamese. These coordinators help address racial inequity in underserved communities, as these communities are disproportionately affected by social and economic barriers to good health. The program has made life-changing improvements for many participants. When John A. in Gardner, MA lost his job as a cook at age 52, his diet and his health deteriorated, impacting his ability to regain employment. FSP resources gave John the opportunity to take back his diet and his future. ¡°Not only has this program helped me financially in terms of paying for groceries, but the cooking shows [hosted by Project Bread chefs and nutritionists] have reignited my passion for cooking. Now, food is medicine to me,¡± said participant John A. To learn more, access Project Bread¡¯s Food Security is Health Care Impact Report.

These initiatives can be tailored to specific community needs and contexts, but they share the common goal of addressing food insecurity and improving nutritional outcomes through agricultural means."
"USDA Equity Commission Communications Lead in  Equity  Initiatives  Mar 14,  As a Latina woman, raised in a black community by a single white mother, Poppy Sias-Hernandez understands how access to equitable support and resources can have a life changing impact. In , Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer appointed Sias-Hernandez as the first-ever Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer (EIO) in the Executive Office of the Governor. In addition to her role as the Chief EIO, she also serves as the Executive Director of the Office of Global Michigan. In February , Sias-Hernandez became one of 15 members appointed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Equity Commission. Appointees serve two-year terms and bring a unique understanding of their individual fields and professional niches. The commission and its two subcommittees ¨C the Agriculture Subcommittee and Rural Community Economic Development Subcommittee - are tasked with evaluating USDA programs and services and recommending ways USDA can reduce barriers to access by implementing transformative changes. Sias-Hernandez credits gaining access to an affordable community college education with changing her life¡¯s trajectory. After high school, Sias-Hernandez moved to California to live with her father. There, she was able to take community college classes for $15 per credit hour, a complete departure from Michigan where community college was not financially accessible or feasible. This opportunity allowed her to become the first in her family to receive a college education, which included a bachelor¡¯s degree from University of California at Berkley and a master¡¯s degree in Organizational Change Leadership from Western Michigan University, where she received a Thurgood Marshall Fellowship. Her first class at Berkely was titled ¡°Women of Color in the U.S.¡±. According to Sias-Hernandez, that¡¯s where she did a lot of early thinking regarding issues concerning equity and inclusion. The experiences and knowledge gained from that course have been formative over the course of her personal and professional life. Sias-Hernandez credits the young female professor teaching the course with recognizing that the material had ¡°lit a fire within her¡±. Sias-Hernandez explains, ¡°She said to me, ¡®This is going to be a challenge in life. Are you ready? You are going to have to find a way to drive the change you want to see while understanding that you will likely never see it.¡¯¡± These words became the foundation to Sias-Hernandez¡¯s life. ¡°That was so formative and has been throughout my life because it is the truth,¡± said Sias-Hernandez. ¡°I still have that mindset. How do you keep showing up with love, integrity, and generosity knowing you¡¯re not always going to see the change you are working for?¡± As a professional, Sias-Hernandez has devoted much of her 20-plus year career to building and creating equity. During the pandemic, Sias-Hernandez partnered with other Michigan state government departments to build a migrant community response model to provide access to healthcare, financial assistance, and other resources to impacted farmworkers. One of her partners in this project, the Michigan Secretary of Agriculture, encouraged Sias-Hernandez to apply for the USDA Equity Commission. Initially, Sias-Hernandez was apprehensive about a potential role on the Commission, but says she quickly discovered how much good work was possible. More than six months into the work, she says she¡¯s impressed by the collective expertise of the Commission, and the group¡¯s willingness to collaborate and share their individual gifts, talents, and lived experiences. ¡°I am loving this Commission. I am loving the learning; I am loving the high level of commitment,¡± she said. ¡°It¡¯s the right formula to create terrific momentum and you have these Commissioners who are just super committed to doing good work.¡± From Sias-Hernandez's viewpoint, the work of the Equity Commission creates systems that are accessible to all population groups. ¡°Sometimes you hear equity talked about through an individual lens, referenced as meeting people where they are,¡± said Sias-Hernandez. ¡°But I really think about equity through a systems level lens and through a population level lens.¡± Sias-Hernandez describes governmental systems and programs like a current in a stream. ¡°These systems should be designed to keep people in the current. But what actually happens is that some people have to swim upstream to access the current, because it really wasn¡¯t made for them,¡± she said. ¡°My vision for equity is that we are creating a current that captures all people; that anyone can step into the stream and swim with the current rather than having to struggle against it.¡±  Category/Topic:  Equity  Initiatives  Tags:  equity  USDA  You May Also Like  Reflections from the Road in Pennsylvania: Charting the Path Forward with Urban Agriculture and the Next Generation  Dr. Jennie L.

"-Young, Under Secretary, Research, Education, and Economics & USDA Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Feb 28,  As I reflect on Black History Month, I think about the tremendous accomplishments and contributions made by Black Americans. I think of the past, present and future to acknowledge how far we¡¯ve come, where we are now, and the challenges ahead. For me, one the most concerning challenges still facing Black Americans is the disproportional high rates of cancer and chronic diseases. With the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting half of all African American adults have some form of cardiovascular disease, and that Black men and women have the highest rates of dying from cancer ¨C something must change. This issue hits very close to home for me. Growing up in Georgia, food was a part of my communities¡¯ culture and heritage. Food brought people together, the dishes were delicious, however they weren¡¯t always good for our health. This led to many of our staple dishes being loaded with excess sodium and calories. Unfortunately, it was this approach to eating that left many of my family members ultimately fighting heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, and cancer. As jarring as this may seem, this is just one of many similar stories shared by Black Americans. Recently in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I heard similar experiences echoed by Black community members at a listening session at Southern University. This listening session was the first in a series hosted by USDA¡¯s Agricultural Science Center of Excellence for Nutrition and Diet for Better Health (ASCEND for Better Health) to discuss how food access, nutrition security, and diet affect health outcomes in underserved communities. ASCEND for Better Health is a new USDA initiative that aims to reduce the burden of diet-related chronic diseases, like cancer, by enhancing precision nutrition research and sharing that research with the communities it impacts. ASCEND for Better Health also supports President Biden¡¯s Cancer Moonshot to end cancer as we know it and is tied to the goals laid out in the White House National Strategy on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health. As we step into National Nutrition Month tomorrow, I am hopeful for the future health and wellbeing of Black Americans thanks to initiatives like USDA¡¯s ASCEND for Better Health. A brighter future is ahead in which healthy, nutritious foods are accessible to all and specific nutrition advice is available so everyone can live long, high-quality and prosperous lives.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service Office of Communications in  Research and Science  Jul 08,  According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 5.8 million Americans aged 65 or older live with Alzheimer¡¯s disease, and that number is projected to nearly triple by . Fortunately, USDA-funded research may have found a tasty way to slow disease onset. A study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that diets high in flavonoids may protect cognitive health. Flavonoids are plant nutrients known for their antioxidant, antiviral, and anticancer properties and are found in berries, tea, dark chocolate, and other foods. ¡°Alzheimer¡¯s disease is a significant public health challenge,¡± said Paul Jacques, nutritional epidemiologist at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. ¡°Given the absence of drug treatments, preventing Alzheimer¡¯s disease through a healthy diet is an important consideration.¡± Jacques¡¯s study, which followed 2,809 people for nearly 20 years, revealed that diets high in fruits and vegetables showed significant promise to quell the onset of Alzheimer¡¯s. ¡°Our study showed that individuals with the highest intakes of flavonoids were more than 50% less likely to develop Alzheimer¡¯s disease, relative to those with the lowest intakes,¡± he said. ¡°Plant foods, such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds are good sources of flavonoids.¡± According to Jacques, flavonoid-rich diets help more than just Alzheimer¡¯s disease and related dementia. ¡°The bottom line is that there are many reasons to consume a healthy diet, including lower risks of cardiovascular disease and some cancers. We can now add protection of cognitive health and prevention of Alzheimer¡¯s disease to that list.¡±  Category/Topic:  Research and Science  Tags:  Agricultural Research Service  ARS  USDA Science  Massachusetts  Nutrition  health  Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging  You May Also Like  USDA Nutrition Research Fuels Olympians¡¯ Engines  Meet Mari Gomez¡ªPublic Servant at USDA & Leader in Her Community  Shining a Spotlight on USDA Research, Education, and Economics Mission Area Employees",What agricultural foods rich in flavonoids have been found to potentially slow down the onset of Alzheimer's disease?,"Berries, tea, dark chocolate, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds are good sources of flavonoids that may help slow down the onset of Alzheimer's disease."
"and Jess Ryan, USDA-ARS Office of Communications in  Research and Science  May 30,  The U.S. cotton industry contributes 35% of the cotton exported globally. Cotton processing can require intense work and training, including the proper use of the cotton gins commonly used to speed up the cleaning process of cotton seeds, removal of foreign materials, and compression of the cotton into lint bales. In perspective, one bale of cotton can make more than 200 pairs of jeans or 1,200 t-shirts. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service shows 509 active cotton gins are currently operating in the U.S. Recently, the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the National Cotton Ginners Association (NCGA) partnered in an annual outreach program to provide cotton ginners education and training for industry workers. USDA-ARS research leaders and the NCGA Vice President lead the efforts with assistance from USDA-ARS scientists, NCGA member associations, land grant universities, industry partners, and stakeholder groups. ""These annual schools are a significant outreach program to the industry and a diverse group of workers,"" said Greg Holt, research leader at the Cotton Production and Processing Research Unit in Lubbock, Texas. ""The schools' curriculum emphasizes increasing ginning efficiency, turning out high-quality fiber, and focusing on improving safety."" The schools represent a successful coordinated effort between the USDA-ARS and stakeholders. The first school was held at the USDA-ARS Cotton Ginning Research Laboratory in Stoneville, Mississippi, in , after a group of industry leaders and USDA officials saw the need for a training program that would teach ginning operations and safety. The Western Ginners School at the Southwestern Cotton Ginning Research Laboratory in Las Cruces, New Mexico, started in , followed by the Southwest Ginners School in Lubbock, Texas, in . Since , approximately 10,625 students have attended all three schools. The schools cover safety, hydraulics, pneumatics, machinery settings, and moisture control. In addition, a total of 465 individuals have successfully completed the Certified Ginners Program that began in . The curriculum continues to evolve to account for industry changes. Decades of training provided by the Cotton Ginners Schools reflect USDA¡¯s commitment to working with partners to ensure producers have the support they need to increase cotton production and quality.

"USDA-NRCS Public Affairs Specialist in  Conservation  Dec 18,   Each day U.S. farmers and ranchers make thousands of management decisions, ranging from when and what to plant to weighing options for conserving their operation¡¯s natural resources. They depend on an array of experts, research and to inform these decisions. One of their sources is the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), USDA¡¯s primary private lands conservation agency. NRCS generates, manages, and shares the , technology, and standards that inform conservation decisions by farmers and ranchers, policy makers and others. Many of these are generated through co-produced science, delivered by the NRCS-led Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP). CEAP assessments are carried out at national, regional, and watershed scales for conservation efforts related to cropland, grazing land, wetlands, and wildlife. First funded through the Farm Bill, CEAP quantifies and on trends in voluntary conservation practices, and associated outcomes, over time. CEAP findings help guide conservation program policies and support conservationists, farmers, and partners in making informed management decisions backed by and science.

"ARS Office of Communications in  Health and Safety  Research and Science  Jun 07,  Today is World Food Safety Day, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has launched a sweeping new initiative known as the Salmonella Grand Challenge. The project brings together an elite group of ARS, university and food industry scientists from different specialties to fight Salmonella, a foodborne pathogen that sickens over a million Americans each year, sometimes fatally. The challenge complements the work being done by the Food Safety and Inspection Service to develop a more effective strategy to reduce human Salmonella illness linked to poultry. ARS¡¯ goal is to integrate its research to learn more about how and where Salmonella causes the highest risk of contamination to meat and poultry products. That information will help researchers develop better monitoring tools for meat and poultry producers to detect Salmonella contamination. Salmonella, the bacterium that causes the illness called salmonellosis, lurks just about everywhere ¨C on animals (including pets), in food, water, soil and even air. People infected by Salmonella suffer symptoms that can include diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting. Serious infections can lead to life-long health problems and even death. The ARS team will integrate its ongoing research by combining, standardizing and coordinating efforts to create harmonized datasets. This will help them identify larger trends, emerging threats and novel Salmonella mitigation strategies. That¡¯s a large task because there are over 2,500 types of Salmonella bacteria and their risks are different across all production systems. The research team will use machine-learning tools to manage and bring together this huge amount of . The collaboration will help researchers learn from each other and will hopefully lead to break-through discoveries. The Salmonella Grand Challenge will enable researchers to better understand Salmonella risk, develop accurate models, and develop tools for meat and poultry producers to monitor their operations. Ultimately, the team hopes their efforts will contribute to the Healthy People objective of reducing salmonellosis by 25%. This work helps drive USDA¡¯s commitment to ensuring a safe U.S. food supply.

"National Agricultural Statistics Service Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Mar 17,  The states that produce some of the most nutritious and most consumed commodities within each of the five food groups. Many people want to cultivate healthier eating habits and March, National Nutrition Month, may be a great time to start. USDA¡¯s Food and Nutrition Service¡¯s MyPlate website is a resource available to help get on (or back on) the nutrition track. MyPlate itself is divided into five major food groups ¨C vegetables, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy and fortified soy alternatives. But do you ever wonder where your food comes from, and how much our hardworking farmers and ranchers produce in a year? Here are facts about some of America¡¯s favorite, nutritious foods: According to USDA¡¯s Economic Research Service (ERS), the tomato is one of the most commonly eaten vegetables in the country. In , U.S. farmers produced 24.1 billion pounds of tomatoes with California producing more than 97%. Apples are also a big hit in the U.S.. In , our growers produced nearly 11 billion pounds, nearly 69% of which came from Washington state. The average yield from each of Washington¡¯s 172,000 total apple bearing acres was 44,200 pounds! For , check out the Non-Citrus Fruits & Nuts Annual Report. Wheat, a health-promoting grain found in many foods, is one of our largest field crops. In , U.S. farmers produced 1.8 billion bushels of it, with North Dakota producing more than 17% of the total. For animal protein, according to ERS, chicken still tops the list in American diets. In , 58.3 billion pounds of chicken were produced in the U.S., more than 14% or 8.3 billion pounds in the top producing state of Georgia. New will be available on April 29 in the Poultry Production and Value Report. Finally, there is dairy. Versatile and packed with important nutrients, fluid beverage milk is one of the most consumed dairy products in the country. Americans consumed more than 46.4 billion pounds, or 5.4 billion gallons, of it last year alone. At the farm level (milk produced and used in all dairy products), U.S. farmers produced a whopping 223.2 billion pounds in ; California was the No. 1 milk producer with 41.3 billion pounds.

"Release & Contact Info  Press Release  Release No. .23  Contact: USDA Press Email: press@usda.gov  WASHINGTON, Sept. 26, ¨C The U.S. Department of Agriculture today announced that it is giving an estimated 3,000 more school districts in high-need areas the option to serve breakfast and lunch to all students at no cost, by expanding the availability of the Community Eligibility Provision, commonly known as CEP. ¡°Today¡¯s announcement comes as we approach the one-year anniversary of the historic White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition, and Health, where the Biden-Harris Administration promised to advance a pathway to healthy school meals for all students,¡± said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ¡°USDA has taken an important step toward fulfilling that promise by expanding access to CEP. Increasing access to free, healthy school breakfast and lunch will decrease childhood hunger, improve child health and student readiness, and put our nation on the path to better nutrition and wellness.¡± CEP is a simplified meal service option that allows schools to provide meals at no cost to all students without requiring families to apply for free and reduced-price meals. Instead, school districts receive federal funding based on a formula using existing from SNAP and other programs, and local or state funds must fill any gap between program costs and federal support. Before this final rule, at least 40% of students had to live in households participating in certain income-based federal assistance programs, in order for a school, group of schools, or school district to be eligible for CEP. This final rule lowers that threshold from 40% to 25%. While this change in CEP applies across the country, it will be particularly impactful in states and school districts which commit to supporting healthy school meals for all students with their own funds. Eight states have taken additional permanent actions to make sure hunger is not a barrier to children¡¯s success, in addition to allowing eligible schools to participate in CEP. California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Vermont passed state laws allowing their schools to serve healthy school meals to all their students at no cost. In these states, schools that previously were not eligible for CEP can now take advantage of this final rule to experience more efficient, streamlined school meal operations as well as predictable federal funding levels. CEP ¨C and all models for providing healthy school meals for all at no cost ¨C is a win-win for schools, kids, families and communities and provides many benefits, including:  Lowering food costs for families;  Increasing food and nutrition security, especially for students from households that barely miss the cutoff to be eligible for free and reduced-price school meals;  Eliminating school meal debt;  Reducing social stigma for students who eat free or reduced-price meals, while other students pay full price;  Increasing student participation in school breakfast and lunch programs, which increases revenues and helps schools offer healthier meals; and  Saving time by simplifying program operations for hardworking school nutrition staff. ¡°Healthy school meals are an essential part of the school environment ¡ª just like teachers, classrooms and books ¨C and set kids up for success and better health,¡± said Stacy Dean, USDA deputy under secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services. ¡°More children are fueled for learning and development when they can count on tasty, nutritious meals at school. While there is still more work ahead to ensure every K-12 student in the nation can access healthy school meals at no cost, this is a significant step on the pathway towards that goal.¡± USDA is also supporting expanded access to healthy school meals by offering extensive financial support for schools, including providing:  50 cents more per lunch and 18 cents more per breakfast for school year -24, compared to last school year¡¯s base reimbursement rates, through annual inflation adjustments and Supply Chain Assistance;  $30 million in Healthy Meals Incentives grants to 264 small and rural school districts nationwide;  $30 million in Equipment Grants for states and school districts operating school lunch programs; and  Nearly $11 million in Farm to School Grants, serving 1.2 million children. USDA also continues to expand its Direct Certification for Medicaid Demonstration Projects, which ensure that eligible children in households receiving Medicaid benefits automatically receive free or reduced price school meals without their families filling out an application. The demonstration projects have been implemented in 38 states, and USDA continues to invite more states to participate. In school year -, 1.4 million students received free and reduced-price school meals thanks to direct certification through Medicaid.

"State Director, Southern New England, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 26,  As USDA Rural Development (RD) highlights National Cooperative Month, one worker owned co-op in Massachusetts stands out as a model for sustainability, collaboration, and local food system resiliency. The saying goes ¡°it¡¯s not easy being green.¡± But for Real Pickles in Greenfield, Massachusetts, the co-op wouldn¡¯t have it any other way; they went green in with the addition of solar panels on its roof. Real Pickles Cooperative of Massachusetts RD assisted with the effort, providing $20,000 through the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). The 18.06kWH PV Solar System on the roof of the business was installed by neighboring worker owned solar co-op, PV Squared, and replaced 100 percent of the pickle co-op¡¯s energy needs at that time. So how did this green, innovative co-op come about? Two decades ago, Dan Rosenberg saw a need. Most pickles in the area were being produced with vinegar and preservatives. The old-fashioned pickle that Grandma used to make- naturally fermented with naturally occurring live cultures- was missing from local grocery store shelves. Determined to bring them back, Dan brought some veggies home from an organic vegetable farm where he worked and began making pickles the old-fashioned way. He was soon joined by wife and business partner, Addie Rose Holland, and Real Pickles launched in . They processed their pickles at a business incubator kitchen created by Franklin County Community Development Corporation, which provided a venue for making value-added foods with local farm ingredients. In , Real Pickles moved into their own building and expanded their operations. Today, the co-op sources its produce from eight locally owned farms and the future looks bright. Addie said, ¡°Real Pickles is rooted in this community and it has been supported by this community for the last 21 years. Becoming a worker owned cooperative helps to maintain jobs in our community and continues the cycle of local economic development.¡± When asked for her favorite pickle pun, Addie said, ¡°We¡¯re kind of a big ¡°dill.¡± We couldn¡¯t agree more.

Over 200 members of the Somali Bantu community of Lewiston, Maine, make the short drive out to Liberation Farms a few times each week to tend their crops. Visitors to our farm often comment on how few weeds they spot between stalks of corn. It¡¯s not magic, we tell them: our farmers are constantly in friendly competition to see who can have the best-looking plot. Like a large-scale community garden, Liberation Farms allows families to grow food for themselves. We want to feed our kids the foods that we grew up with in Somalia, like corn, greens, and goat meat. Working together, we can make this happen in a way we never could have individually. In , support from community partners helped us move our farm operations onto a single property where we have room for everyone ¨C and a herd of goats, too! Many people in our community are supporting large families through hourly-wage jobs. Since high-quality produce is otherwise unaffordable for us, growing for ourselves at Liberation Farms is a path to financial savings and food independence. We also use the SNAP and WIC programs to give our community and others much-needed nourishment, boosting the health and cultural connections of younger generations. Liberation Farms is also growing our Iskaashito program, through which farmers work together to sell vegetables at our farmers markets and farm stand. People beyond the Somali Bantu community are buying everything from cornmeal to tomatoes from us, and we encourage them to use food stamps to turn just a few dollars into a fresh basket of veggies. We are so excited to see what the future brings now that we have found a home here in Maine.

"AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow, Office of the Chief Scientist in  Research and Science  Dec 20,  Years ago, I spent my days watching pecan roots change the color of solutions from clear to red as they reduced iron for uptake. It may not sound exciting, but that was the topic of my undergraduate research internship at USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Children¡¯s Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) in Houston, TX, under the direction of my mentor, ARS scientist Dr. Michael Grusak. Dr. Grusak taught me to consider the link between the laboratory and society. His lab focused on improving crop mineral uptake, which could benefit society by increasing the nutritional value of crops for humans. The emphasis on this connection between plant biology and society stimulated my interest in plant biology and, eventually, led me to pursue my own Ph.D. in plant physiology and genetics. Now, that summer job has led me back to USDA as a Science and Technology Policy Fellow through the American Association of the Advancement of Science in the USDA Office of the Chief Scientist, where I work directly to connect science to society. In my new role, I¡¯m able to use science to inform agricultural policy making decisions by collaborating with others in USDA to develop science-based solutions to emerging issues, especially those related to improving agricultural resilience in response to climate change. As an undergraduate intern, I was excited to contribute to ARS research, but never imagined that the roots I put down at CNRC would lead me back to USDA, supporting priorities that help advance American agriculture and aid in an all-of-government approach to mitigate and adapt to climate change. ARS internship opportunities support future generations of the agricultural workforce.

"Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Nutrition Security  Jun 22,  The Food and Nutrition Service¡¯s Mid-Atlantic Region recently joined forces with the New Jersey Department of Agriculture to recognize Programs for Parents, a Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) sponsor in Essex County, NJ, with a regional CACFP Achievement Award for their creative and dedicated efforts to promote nutrition security among children. Their program emphasizes meal quality, nutrition education, and the overall wellness of its childcare providers, children and parents/caregivers. Programs for Parents uses a variety of communication tools, shared in both English and Spanish, to translate the dietary into easy-to-use materials for childcare providers and families. Targeted Facebook posts focus on the importance of incorporating fruit and vegetables into food patterns, watching sugar content, and reading nutrition labels. They recently established a CACFP Facebook group where local childcare providers can share healthy recipes and ideas while also receiving nutrition and wellness tips. Programs for Parents uses their monthly newsletter, ¡°Child Care Matters,¡± to educate providers, parents and stakeholders on the value of good nutrition in early child development. A recent article discussed studies that have shown kids who eat breakfast have better attention spans and included a list of good morning foods for kids. Programs for Parents also offers hands-on learning to their communities. A registered dietitian nutritionist facilitated a virtual cooking class for providers last fall. The program sent providers three recipes in advance and provided them with a $25 gift card to offset the cost of ingredients they purchased to use during the class. Participants learned to make tasty turkey burger sliders and healthy snacks for children. Last year Programs for Parents also launched incentive grants of up to $ for CACFP providers, enabling them to purchase kitchen and food prep items such as refrigerators, freezers, crockpots, and utensils to help providers make healthy snacks and meals. Nearly all of the providers participated, and CACFP enrollment increased by 25%. The Programs for Parents CACFP program, operating since , is a great example of the inroads that early childcare providers can make into better health and nutrition for children and families in need.

"APHIS Legislative and Public Affairs in  Animals  Dec 04,  Bats are crucial to the wellbeing of our natural ecosystems, but also have the potential to spread disease. APHIS Wildlife Services and the One Health Commission recently sponsored a student infographic contest to help change the narrative on bats. Lately, when we hear about bats in the news it's often in the context of emerging infectious diseases. Yet, despite potential public health threats, bats are extremely important to the health of our natural ecosystems. Zoonotic diseases, or zoonoses, are those diseases that can be transmitted between animals and humans. To help educate young adults about the importance of bats to our environment, as well as the potential for some bats to transmit zoonoses, such as rabies, USDA Wildlife Services (WS) and the One Health Commission (OHC) recently sponsored an infographic competition among college students. An infographic is a creative collection of images, charts, and minimal text to present or other information. ¡°To ensure participating college students had a good understanding of the issues surrounding bats and disease before they started designing their infographics, we developed a 5-minute video explaining the One Health approach and why it is key to addressing wildlife diseases like rabies.¡± states Alison Barbee, a biological science technician with the rabies research project at the WS National Wildlife Research Center. The One Health approach emphasizes the interconnectedness of people, animals, and the environment. It also encourages experts from multiple disciplines to work together locally, nationally and globally to achieve the best health for all three. The control of human rabies deaths and exposures through the vaccination of animal reservoirs, such as domestic dogs and terrestrial wildlife, is considered an example of a successful One Health approach. WS, OHC, and other agencies are building upon that success to address concerns about bats and the spread of rabies, as well as other diseases. ¡°If we are going to successfully manage bat rabies and other novel viruses for the benefit of bats, people and the environment, we need to better understand how these pathogens are maintained and spread in bat populations,¡± states Barbee. ¡°We also need to effectively communicate that information with others.¡± Winning infographic on bats and rabies created by Colorado State University graduate student Brooke MacNeill. The winner of the infographic contest was Brooke MacNeill, a graduate student in the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Colorado State University. MacNeill¡¯s infographic focused on the role of bats in the environment, and what is being done to prevent the spread of rabies from wildlife to people. Her design targeted students in grades 6 through 12 and was created in both English and Spanish. She received a $500 cash award and her design was shared with natural resources, public health, and One Health practitioners around the globe. The runner up was Stephen Nachtsheim a graduate student in Biomedical Communications at the University of Toronto. His design focused on the benefits of bats and their population declines due to various diseases. He received a $100 cash prize.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Jan 27,  The Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program helps vets repay qualified student loans for service as food animal veterinarians in selected areas of the country. (iStock image) This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA¡¯s rich science and research portfolio. A solid education is crucial to those seeking careers in animal science. However, many student loans can be burdensome. But a student loan payment the size of a mortgage couldn¡¯t stop someone who has wanted to be a veterinarian since they learned to talk. Dr. Annie Bowes is one of those people. After acquiring the knowledge to begin her dream career, Dr. Bowes was left with overwhelming debt.? Luckily for this Idaho-based veterinarian, she wasn¡¯t left alone to repay it. In , she received assistance through the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP) a program funded by USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). Through VMLRP, NIFA may repay up to $25,000 each year of student loan debt to eligible veterinarians. ?In return, qualified veterinarians must agree to provide food animal medical care for three years in certain high-priority veterinary shortage situations.? VMLRP has helped 245 veterinarians since the program¡¯s inception in . ¡°I am thankful for this assistance,¡± Bowes said. ¡°It allowed me to establish myself in a rural area where it¡¯s difficult to be successful. I am now able to treat animals at six to eight different farms per day and have more than 600 repeat clients.¡± Veterinarians are critical to America¡¯s food safety, food security, and to the health and well-being of both animals and humans. Studies indicate there are significant shortages of food animal veterinarians in certain areas of the country. A leading cause for the scarcity in this profession is the heavy price tag that four years of professional veterinary medical training carries, which leaves current graduates of veterinary colleges with an average debt of $162,000. Bowes owns Aspen Veterinary Service, a mobile service treating large animals, as well as an Emergency Clinic with a staff of 15 and more than 10,000 repeat customers. Dr. Tim VanDerPloeg is another veterinarian using USDA¡¯s assistance to expand rural veterinary services. VanDerPloeg will open Veterinary Center of Somerset, in Kentucky, soon. Pulaski County, where the clinic will be located, is the third largest cattle county in the state of Kentucky.? The clinic will have a 2,300-square-foot large animal facility in addition to the 3,400-square-foot small animal facility. ¡°Although recipients of the loan repayment assistance are only to commit to three years of veterinary service in a designated shortage area, veterinarians like Bowes and VanDerPloeg suggest that the impacts from this funding and connections to their service areas go well beyond three years,¡± said Gary Sherman, VMLRP national program leader with NIFA. Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"APHIS Intern in  Animals  Plants  Apr 19,  The new face of USDA/APHIS Veterinary Medicine, Dr. Jack Shere, is also a familiar one. Dr. Jack Shere, a long-time employee of USDA¡¯s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), was recently named USDA¡¯s Chief Veterinary Officer leading APHIS¡¯s Veterinary Services program. Dr. Shere joined APHIS in and has held a variety of field and leadership positions ¨C serving as the area commander during the exotic Newcastle disease outbreak in and spending many weeks in Iowa during the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza outbreak where he represented USDA and Secretary Vilsack.? Dr. Shere also spent several years in private veterinary practice prior to joining APHIS. Asked about his goals for Veterinary Services under his leadership, Dr. Shere explained that the program has faced with budget changes over the past several years, which has reduced our field force and the ability to respond as quickly as we would like.? He¡¯s committed to moving the program forward and addressing those needs.? ¡°The challenge is to re-strengthen and build us back to what we used to be.¡± Dr. Shere will bring his enthusiasm for learning to his new role.? While he already has many degrees ¨C B.S. in Biology and Chemistry, M.S. in Education with a minor in counseling, doctorate in Veterinary Medicine, and Ph.Ds in both Poultry Science and Microbiology ¨C Dr. Shere wants to continue to be a lifetime learner.? ¡°There¡¯s always new knowledge out there, and you can always acquire more.? It¡¯s just fascinating to know how much you won¡¯t ever know!¡± But what brought him to the veterinary field was his love of caring for animals.? As a child, he would often take wounded animals home to take care of, and Dr. Shere said his mother ¡°never knew what she would find in [his] top dresser drawer.¡±? A few years later, he made the conscious decision to become a veterinarian when dealing with his family¡¯s German Shepard puppy, which had become increasingly ill.? On a Friday evening, the puppy had a violent seizure.? The family vet said he was closing his office for the day, and recommended that the animal be euthanized on Monday morning if it was still alive.? Dr. Shere¡¯s father was left in a terrible position, and decided to put the animal out of its misery that night.? While heartbreaking, it prompted Dr. Shere to resolve that after becoming a veterinarian himself, he would always go and help an animal if he was called ¨C ¡°So when I was in practice, if anyone called me, I would go, no matter what the time.¡±?

"Deputy Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service¡¯s Livestock and Poultry Program in  Food and Nutrition  Health and Safety  Dec 15,  USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and Purdue University have developed a series of training videos that illustrate proper sanitation assessment techniques to evaluate shell egg processing equipment. While the practices in these videos are in facilities that have USDA grading, they are valuable for any shell egg facility wishing to learn more about good sanitation techniques. To support emerging needs across the egg industry in recent years, AMS reviewed its internal procedures to assess equipment sanitation in shell egg processing plants. The agency visited over 30 shell egg processing facilities across the country to assess equipment sanitation and consistency. In order to document and share findings, AMS partnered with Purdue and ARS to develop this educational video series. The videos take the viewer through each phase of shell egg processing and explain how to inspect each component of the facility for sanitation effectiveness. The 18 videos are a great resource for shell egg processing facilities by illustrating what clean machines and facilities should look like prior to daily verification by USDA grading personnel.

HACCP is a food production, storage, and distribution monitoring system for identification and control of associated health hazards using definitive scientific tests. Its purpose is to prevent contamination of food products during processing. USDA photo. Today kicked off ¡°Get Smart about Antibiotics¡± week in the United States and the World Health Organization¡¯s World Antibiotic Awareness Week in . During this week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its other federal partners want to remind families and communities about the importance of responsible antibiotic use in both humans and animals, to help reduce the development of resistant bacteria. This week, we also celebrate the 20th anniversary of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS).? Through NARMS, USDA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborate on everything relating to antimicrobial resistant bacteria.? ?Since , USDA¡¯s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) have been active participants in this combined federal surveillance program. So, what is antimicrobial resistance?? As you might recall, in , Dr. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin, a drug that revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections. In the years following, penicillin and the discovery and therapeutic use of other antibiotics, we have relied on antibiotics to treat and cure a variety of illnesses - in both humans and animals, across the globe. The use of these drugs has aided in the development of resistant strains of bacteria. Unfortunately, this development means that some previously treatable forms of bacterial infections are now resistant to the antibiotics that were designed to treat them. It is estimated that the decrease in effectiveness of antibiotics, results in more than two million U.S. cases of antibiotic resistant infections, annually. Some of these types of infections might require longer hospital stays and are more costly to treat successfully.? As scientists, we call this problem antimicrobial resistance (AMR). ?Dr. Fleming even raised this concern in after receiving the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of penicillin.? The AMR threat in humans and animals is becoming an increasing problem and requires the adoption of a One Health approach. ?This approach is founded on principles that recognize that the health of people and populations are linked to the health of animals and environments. For example, antibiotics are used in food-producing animals to prevent illness, limit the spread of infections in a herd or flock, and treat diseases. ?Because antibiotics are administered to animals, food products derived from them can serve as a vehicle for the movement of resistant bacteria to humans, just as antibiotics administered to people can affect the environment, including the environment of animals. The One Health approach brings together the expertise of physicians, veterinarians, environmental scientists, and other public health professionals so that problems can be identified and actionable solutions are developed that can minimize the emergence and spread of AMR. World Antibiotics Awareness Week USDA is uniquely positioned to contribute to the body of knowledge about resistant bacteria through the collaboration and ongoing work of experts both within and outside of the Department. For the last 20 years, ARS and FSIS have partnered alongside FDA and CDC to collect and define AMR bacteria in meat and poultry products. Through the NARMS program, ARS and FSIS continually monitor changes in AMR bacteria from animal meat through the FSIS regulatory testing program and from animals through the new cecal sampling surveillance program. ?The sampling results from these two programs help to identify new or changing resistant bacterial patterns and show comparisons between bacteria found in animals used for food and bacteria important in human medicine. This information is critically essential for scientists to understand how resistant bacteria emerge and spread. In , USDA in collaboration with its public health partners began using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to further characterize AMR bacteria in real-time. WGS is a process that can determine the DNA sequence of bacteria collected from food animal samples. This method allows scientists to understand similarities and differences between bacteria with greater detail than ever before. The information gained from WGS helps USDA and NARMS monitor AMR bacteria with more accuracy and to identify more specifically the types of bacteria that cause foodborne illness. Despite USDA¡¯s long history of significant activities and investments in AMR, including its strong twenty years of NARMS collaboration as well as USDAs¡¯ own AMR Action Plan (, 322 ); a considerable amount of work remains to be done to address knowledge gaps in AMR and for further strengthen the current programs. To achieve the greatest public health impact, USDA must continue to coordinate and leverage expertise across many areas. And to ensure that effectiveness of antibiotics is preserved for treating both people and animals and that it is extended to future generations, USDA, other federal agencies, industry, and academic partners are working together to better understand the role of animal production environments in the development and spread of AMR bacteria.?

"Posted by U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell in  Forestry  Dec 19,  The Paisley Ranger District of the Fremont-Winema National Forest in Oregon worked with numerous partners to complete a large-scale multi-year restoration project that covered 15 miles of the Chewaucan River. The project included adding vegetation to eroding stream banks. (U.S. Forest Service) I am proud to announce that we exceeded our ecological restoration goals for Fiscal Year . This was no small feat. A lot of great people across the U.S. Forest Service worked hard to make it a reality. We did substantial homework and planning, and then based on that we made strategic investments across all agency programs to help us create resilient forests, grasslands and watersheds while sustaining communities. This work reduced the wildland fire threats to communities and firefighters and minimized the risk of forest pests and climate change, while supporting American jobs and rural economies. That is a fantastic combination. The results of this hard work are nothing short of amazing.? The projects we carried out lessened the threats to communities by reducing hazardous fuels on 1.7 million acres in the wildland urban interface, sustained or restored watershed conditions on 2.9 million acres and resulted in 2.8 billion board feet of timber volume sold. Impressively, we did all this despite simultaneously facing a government shutdown, as well as rising costs of fire-fighting that drain resources from our work across all program areas. On a personal level, these accomplishments reflect how much members of our Forest Service community are committed to improving the forests and grasslands that have been entrusted to us by the American people. For these reasons, I could not be more proud of everyone who has come together to make restoration such a success in the past year.

"DVM, Chief Veterinary Officer of the United States, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Dr. Kis Robertson-Hale, Chief Public Health Veterinarian of the United States, Food Safety and Inspection Service in  Animals  Apr 27,  April 30 is World Veterinary Day: a day to celebrate veterinarians, their work and their impact. Although the importance of veterinarians is hardly a secret, people often forget that veterinarians¡¯ work goes beyond clinical care of animals. USDA employs more veterinarians than any other department in the federal government, with positions located across the nation and associated territories. The breadth of roles that veterinarians fill at USDA illustrates their versatility. Veterinary epidemiologist, emergency responder, laboratory diagnostician, and public health veterinarian are just some of the roles that USDA veterinarians fill every day. Resilience is the theme of this year¡¯s World Veterinary Day. From USDA¡¯s perspective, there could not be a more appropriate theme. From responding to the COVID-19 pandemic to inspecting livestock and poultry slaughter facilities to combating animal health threats like the recent detections of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, USDA veterinarians are on the frontlines protecting public health and animal health every day. Their contributions in both areas preserve an essential resource: a food supply that is both dependable and safe. As a nation, we can¡¯t be resilient¡ªin all senses of the word¡ªwithout that. Beyond ensuring a safe and dependable food supply, preparedness is key to staying resilient in the face of animal or human health threats. USDA works with state and tribal partners and other federal agencies in a collaborative effort known as One Health to protect animals, people, and the environment, which are all connected. The interplay of humans, animals, and the natural world affects diseases in animals and humans, and what we learn could help prevent or limit the next outbreak of diseases transmitted from animals to people, or even the next global pandemic. USDA veterinarians play a key role in the One Health approach. USDA veterinarians protect Americans and their animals every day. They make sure our country has a safe and dependable food supply and is prepared for whatever animal or human diseases may come.

"Food Safety Education Staff, Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA in  Health and Safety  Mar 14,  Plan for spring cleaning, a checklist for a food safe pantry and fridge. The refrigerator and pantry are where most people store their food. But these storage areas may also be one of the less frequently cleaned places in your home, which could be hazardous to your health. The refrigerator is one of the most important pieces of equipment in the kitchen. Without it, our food would spoil and could make us sick. Refrigerators should be set to maintain a temperature between 34¡ã and 40¡ãF to preserve our foods. Setting the refrigerator temperature too low will cause your refrigerator to work overtime and could also freeze some of your foods. Many of today¡¯s advanced refrigerators have built-in thermostats that measure their internal temperature. If your fridge does not have a built-in thermostat, you should keep an appliance thermometer inside in a visible place to monitor the temperature. Here are some tips to make your fridge (and your home) more healthy and safe:  Clean spills immediately ¨C Clean surfaces thoroughly with warm, soapy water; then rinse. Do not use solvent cleaning agents or abrasives, as these may allow chemical fumes/tastes into your food and ice cubes and make them unsafe to eat.  Store leftovers safely ¨C Throw out perishable foods that have spoiled and no longer can be eaten. Leftovers like meatloaf, pizza or casseroles shouldn¡¯t be left in the refrigerator more than four days. Refrigerate raw poultry and ground meats for no more than one to two days.  Clean the exterior ¨C Keep your refrigerator free of dust and lint. Clean the condenser coil several times a year with a brush or vacuum cleaner to remove dirt, lint or other accumulations to ensure efficiency and maintain proper temperature. Cleaning your pantry will save you money by keeping you aware of what you have and help you avoid a pantry insect infestation. It will also ensure your foods are safe to consume. Here are some tips for a clean, bug-free pantry:  Check your cans ¨C Discard cans that are leaking, rusted, bulging or badly dented. Never use food from cracked jars, jars with loose or bulging lids, or any container that spurts liquid when you open it.  Throw out any food you suspect is spoiled ¨C Never taste food to determine its safety. Wipe off sticky containers, along with crumbs and spills on your pantry shelves with all-purpose cleaner, vinegar, or warm soap and water.  Check the dates on your foods ¨C ¡°USE by¡± date indicates that perishable products should be consumed by the date listed on the package or discarded once the date has passed. ¡°BEST if Used By¡± date informs shoppers that after the specified date, the shelf-stable product is safe to use or consume, but has exceeded the window of its optimal taste or performance. High-acid canned food such as tomatoes, grapefruit and pineapple have a shelf life of 12 to 18 months beyond their listed dates. Low-acid canned food such as meat, poultry, fish and most vegetables can be kept for two to five years beyond their listed dates ¡ª if the can remains in good condition and has been stored in a cool, clean and dry place. If you have questions about storage times for food or beverages, we recommend downloading our smartphone and tablet application, the FoodKeeper. With more than 150,000 downloads for Android and iOS smartphones, the FoodKeeper is quickly establishing itself as the quick reference go-to guide for safe food storage and preparation.

"White House Fellow in  Food and Nutrition  Apr 02,  A local WIC staff member holds her sleeping baby as she listens to the peer counseling instructor. March is Women¡¯s History month, a time when we highlight everything woman.? In the midst of farming and biofuels, research and forestry would you believe that the USDA also finds time to promote breastfeeding?? The answer is absolutely!? You already know that the agency supports a myriad of nutrition programs to help make America¡¯s children healthy and hunger-free.? Research has shown that there is no better food than breast milk for a baby¡¯s first year of life. Breastfeeding provides many health, nutritional, economical and emotional benefits to mother and baby. Since a major goal of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC) Program is to improve the nutritional status of infants, WIC mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their infants. WIC promotes breastfeeding to all pregnant women as the optimal infant feeding choice, unless medically contraindicated.? So what exactly is WIC doing to support breastfeeding?? The answer is a lot! WIC moms and babies who exclusively breastfeed receive an enhanced food package for a longer duration than non-breastfeeding mothers. Exclusively breastfed babies do not receive formula in their package. Breastfeeding moms can receive breast pumps, breast shells, and other nursing supplies to encourage increased initiation and duration of breastfeeding.

"USDA Center for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships in  Initiatives  Jun 20,  Josepha preparing amaranth greens for a recent dinner put together by some of our gardeners from Burundi. Every month, USDA shares the story of a woman in agriculture who is leading the industry and helping other women succeed along the way. In honor of World Refugee Day, this month we hear from Josepha Ntakirutimana, a refugee from Rwanda who settled in Tucson, Arizona in . Josepha is now an invaluable part of the Tucson New Roots Program which brings together refugees and their community around production and nutrition education activities. Josepha¡¯s journey to Tucson is a long one ¨C as for any refugee, the memories are sometimes painful. When she was a girl, at the age of 12, Josepha started helping her mom at a local farm before school. Later, she worked on a farm during school holidays and, when she was married, her family had a small plot in town where they could grow vegetables and grains to help reduce food costs. After the war, when she left Rwanda and entered into a refugee camp in Malawi, agriculture continued to help her and her family survive. There wasn¡¯t enough food but she was able to start a garden and grew amaranth, squash, and carrots. Being able to carry out this activity in the refugee camp was a welcome change of pace to the camp life, which was hard and full of uncertainty. Gardening also allows for refugees to have access to fresh food, which is welcomed in refugee camps, where food is very limited in amounts and variety.  Now, Josepha considers it a ¡®great joy of living¡¯ to be able to garden and grow her own vegetables in her new home of Tucson. Agriculture is a thread that connects Josepha¡¯s past, present, and future ¨C and is a veritable lifeline. Her refugee story is a real inspiration. Like all the refugees the IRC works to help resettle in the U.S,. she is a survivor, and we are honored to be working with her to help refugees to start a new life in her community. The IRC has 29 offices and helps? 6,000 - 10,000 new arrivals each year in acclimating to their new communities. Over the past 10 years, the IRC has reshaped expectations for nutritional well-being among its refugee clients, and has developed a multifaceted food security and agriculture program called ¡°New Roots"" to increase the supply of and demand for fresh, culturally appropriate foods within immigrant and refugee communities To learn more about their work please visit www.rescue.org/ and follow on twitter at @theIRC. 1. Josepha, can you share your story with us? As a refugee, what was your journey to the United States like? I was a nurse for 21 years in Rwanda. In , there was a genocide in Rwanda. My husband, four children and I were displaced from southern Rwanda to western Rwanda. There I worked as a nurse at a Hospital with a humanitarian aid organization and my husband worked as an interpreter. Because the organizations trusted us, our coworkers became jealous and falsely accused my husband of participating in the genocide. My husband was summoned to the police station and put in jail. He was jailed in prison in southern Rwanda, where he spent nine years. I consider agriculture to be a very important aid during this tough time in my life. Alongside my career, I was practicing agriculture to be able to feed my children and be able to bring biweekly food to my husband in prison. My husband was freed from jail in , but we fled our country so he would not be detained again. We traveled to Malawi and ended up in a refugee camp. It was my first time outside of my country and it felt like going to hell. I was depressed and could not see my future. Much of the food was spoiled, but I fed my family beans, which were still safe to eat. To feed my family, I would ration the beans to the last month. Eventually, I started a garden of amaranth and squash and would mix the beans with the squash to make them last. After a few years, we moved to another refugee camp in Malawi where I could see people I knew from Rwanda. My mind was renewed. I started to go to school to learn English, tailoring, computer skills and counseling. To support my family, I worked in a tailoring shop. After getting a counseling certificate, I became a school counselor and started a group for unaccompanied minors. I created projects to help them make money while encouraging them to stay in school. After nine years in refugee camps, my family resettled in Tucson, Arizona. Fortunately, after 5 months my husband and I found caregiver jobs and I began interpreting for the IRC. Eventually, I became a Community Well-being Promoter and was able to combine my interpretation skills and my passion for food and agriculture. 2. How has your connection to agriculture changed depending on the country in which you live? The biggest difference is in climate ¨C the desert here is dry and hot ¨C Rwanda is dry and humid. Here there¡¯s use of irrigation systems, but in my native country, we depend only on rain.? I was able to raise animals for compost, but I am not allowed to do that here.? There are many plants that are new to me and each has its own season with new tastes, new textures. 3. What is the New Roots Program? The New Roots program helps refugees to become involved in agriculture and to grow their own food. We connect interested refugees to community garden space and provide them with seeds and other resources. We host trainings to help gardeners transfer their agricultural knowledge to the particular climate of the Sonoran Desert. We also enroll clients in public benefits (such as SNAP and WIC) upon arrival, and we implement a 3-module nutrition education with families in need. 4. Have you experienced culture shock? The trip to the United States was difficult; it was my first time flying. We were served new food in flight.? English was a problem because of the difference in pronunciation. My family thought the United States was cold but when we arrived in Tucson at night it was still 100¡ã F when we got off the plane. I had hoped to continue my nursing and counseling education in the U.S., but the cost of living is too high, making it unaffordable to also pay for my education.? Finding work is difficult in a new country and bringing in an income was my first priority.? 5. From which communities do you receive the most support and what have you learned from them that is the most valuable to you? Most of my support has come from International Rescue Committee and from an elderly Caucasian woman whom I met soon after arriving in Tucson.? We have become as close as mother and daughter and from her I can always receive help and advice. 6. Who are your role models? My mother, who just died in Rwanda, was a hard-worker and a confident lady who introduced me to agriculture.? I have her to thank for my love of agriculture. 7. Where do you see yourself in 5, 10, 20 years; how to get there? In five years, I hope to have developed my back yard into a large garden to raise enough food to feed my family with more that I can sell.? In ten years, I hope to have the mortgage on my home paid off.? In twenty years, I hope to be retired and able to enjoy my garden and my grandchildren. 8. What advice for young women interested in agriculture? Share experiences with others, listen to others and share knowledge, never give up their dreams, no matter what they aspire to be in this world. 9. What¡¯s best advice you receive from someone? To trust in myself. Learning doesn¡¯t stop: continue to learn in different ways as long as you are alive. To learn more and connect with other women leaders in agriculture across the country, we encourage you to visit?

Seventy years ago, when Nat ¡°King¡± Cole first regaled us about roasted chestnuts in The Christmas Song, not many Americans could actually enjoy the treat because American chestnut trees were in dire straits. The predominant tree in Eastern American forests was nearing the tail end of a 50-year blight that killed an astonishing three to five billion trees, making the species functionally extinct. Now, however, researchers supported by USDA¡¯s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) are working to restore the American chestnut and may be only a few years away from bringing back the iconic tree.

"Pacific Southwest Research Station, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Research and Science  Mar 08,  Barbara C. Weber in as director of the U.S. Forest Service¡¯s Pacific Southwest Research Station. (Photo courtesy Barbara C. Weber) As the oldest of 11 children, Barbara C. Weber is accustomed to being the ¡°first.¡± With top family ranking comes responsibility, and Weber had plenty of it. Growing up on her family¡¯s 160-acre dairy farm in Bloomington, Wis., Weber, along with her siblings, helped clean the barn, pick up eggs and tend to the animals.? Her innate curiosity and connection to nature led to her love of science. She was the first in her family to go to college, graduating from Viterbo College, a women¡¯s school in LaCrosse, Wis., with a degree in biology. She would go on to earn a master¡¯s degree in entomology at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul and a doctorate in zoology from Southern Illinois University. Few women ranked among the agency¡¯s scientific community when Weber joined in . She became the first woman scientist at the North Central Research Station¡ªwhich later became the Northern Research Station. But being first had its challenges. In , Jackie Robertson, a research entomologist at the Pacific Southwest Research Station became the first to head a research project. Five years later, Weber followed suit. But even as she gathered more experience and prestige in her career as a scientist, Weber was often reminded in both subtle and not-so-subtle ways that she was a woman in a man¡¯s world. She recalls one incident where she arrived with colleagues to a meeting to discuss a project she was spearheading. She was the only woman in the group. While the men mixed and mingled, no one paid any attention to Weber. ¡°They assumed that I was along for the ride, or that I was someone¡¯s wife,¡± Weber said. An embarrassed hush fell over the group when she announced that she was the project leader. ¡°It was fun for me to see their reaction,¡± Weber said. And while Weber managed to keep a lighthearted attitude most of the time, she did admit that at times, the unequal treatment¡ªa snub here, an inappropriate comment there¡ªoccasionally wore on her. But Weber never gave up and through her professionalism proved to be a promising leader. She would go on to work at Forest Service headquarters in Washington, D.C. as a legislative resources specialist, and later staff assistant for planning in the Office of the Deputy Chief for Research. Given all of her ¡°firsts,¡± it was only fitting that Weber become the Forest Service¡¯s first female director of a research station. She headed west to California to lead the Pacific Southwest Research Station in . ?While there, Weber was well-liked by station staff and highly respected for her ability to build consensus. Beyond the science, Weber was instrumental in improving workplace diversity. A consent decree, which specified hiring goals and affirmative action requirements helped pave the way for more women to join the Forest Service in California.? Under Weber¡¯s leadership, the research station received the Chief¡¯s Multicultural Award in . Today, about a third of the Forest Service¡¯s 498 research scientists are women. In , Weber returned to Forest Service headquarters in Washington D.C. to become the associate deputy chief of Research, a position she held until her retirement in . ¡°Barbara broke new ground in everything she did,¡± said Northern Research Station Assistant Director Hao Tran, who worked with Weber from -. ¡°Someone had to pave the way¡ªand she did, in a very elegant and understated way.¡±  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Research and Science  Tags:  Forestry  FS  International Women's Day  Pacific Research Station  Science  Women's History Month",What are some ways to improve workplace diversity in agricultural research stations?,"* Implementing consent decrees that specify hiring goals and affirmative action requirements * Setting aside time to discuss and address unequal treatment and biases, as Barbara C.

For these reasons and more, America¡¯s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. Texas Producer Changes his Mind about Leaving the Farm Jonathan Cobb had made up his mind. He was leaving the farm. ¡°I was disillusioned with farming in general because we were just pushing long days and chasing acres and it didn¡¯t seem like there was very much reward,¡± Cobb said. ¡°That quality of life was not very good. My wife was having to work a lot of hours full time and really support the family. Twenty-five hundred acres really didn¡¯t support two families, and we weren¡¯t living extravagant lifestyles by any means.¡± Then came the drought of . ¡°I thought, maybe this is a sign from God ¨C maybe we shouldn¡¯t be farming. Maybe we should move on to something else,¡¯¡± Cobb said. ¡°I was looking into moving down to Austin, Texas and being involved in some urban farming setups.¡± In time, he and his wife Kaylyn put their house on the market and prepared to move, abandoning a century-old tradition of Cobb family farming. Using diverse cover crops and diverse animal grazing, the Cobbs are building soil health on their farm. Photo: Ron Nichols. Shortly after making that painful decision, Cobb¡¯s father asked him to stop by and review some soil test results that had just arrived at USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service¡¯s office in Temple, Texas. But before he could complete the chore, Cobb found himself ""trapped"" in a soil health workshop featuring NRCS¡¯ Ray Archuleta and Willie Durham. Too polite to leave, he took a seat on the front row. Within minutes, Cobb was entranced by what he was hearing from the presenters and the presentation he was seeing with his own eyes. What he heard that morning from the soil health presenters rekindled a passion and love that conventional agriculture had nearly extinguished. ¡°By the end of the day I knew I was going to stay and be a part of the paradigm shift.¡± Cobb said. Since that fateful day, the Cobb¡¯s have downsized their farm from 2,500 acres to 450 and transitioned from row crops to cover crops with multi-species livestock grazing systems. ¡°We planted over a thousand acres of cover crops the very next year, got rid of all of the tillage equipment, and just dove in,¡± he says.? Cobb admits his farming operation is still evolving, but improving soil health remains the central goal. ¡°One very high priority is to help with the soil and building up the soil and the carbon in the soil,¡± he says. ¡°We will probably make thousands of mistakes but we¡¯ll learn along the way.¡± Whatever happens, he says, ¡°The goal is to build the soil.¡± While Cobb¡¯s new business model hasn¡¯t fully evolved, he and his family are already reaping some of the intrinsic rewards he fondly remembered as a child growing up on the farm ¨C like enjoying the smell of blooming clover in the evening and watching the sun rise on a warm summer day. ¡°If we can make a living and stay here then we couldn¡¯t ask for anything more,¡± he says.

"Deputy Under Secretary for Rural Development in  Rural  Oct 30,   NOTE: This week on the USDA Blog, we¡¯ve been featuring the stories of America¡¯s Harvest Heroes who, like farmers across the nation, are working this harvest season to secure the bounty of healthy food American agriculture is renowned for.

This blog focuses on two heroes of a different kind of harvest ¨C clean, renewable energy that is . I spent some time in Montana earlier this month to attend the Harvesting Clean Energy conference in Billings. We talked about options for continuing to support clean energy development, whether it's bio-based, geothermal, solar, or wind ¨C and how rural America fits in to the picture of clean energy development. Our Rural Energy for America Program was, unsurprisingly, a key focus by the participants. Having been reauthorized by the recent Farm Bill, Congress put REAP in a position to have very real impact on clean energy development in our rural communities. If properly leveraged with other programs, both private and public, and investment from the private sector ¨C the funding made available by Congress could conceivably have a billion-dollar impact on clean energy development in our nation. Red Lodge Ales owner Sam Hoffmann (middle) explains his brewery¡¯s thermal solar heating system to Montana State Director Janelle Gustafson (l) and Deputy Under Secretary Lillian Salerno (r). Hoffmann used the Rural Energy for America Program to purchase and install the thermal system. What strikes me the most is, how many of the projects to this point have been implemented. Rather than just the large complexes ¨C which certainly have their place in the overall picture ¨C rural America has responded by implementing small-scale projects, often at an individual business level, that have had noteworthy impact on the energy structure in their communities. While in Montana, I was able to see first-hand how these small scale projects have made a positive change on not just the carbon footprint and energy consumption of rural small businesses, but on their operational bottom line. I visited Red Lodge, Montana, a small community southwest of Billings that acts as a gateway in to Yellowstone National Park via the Beartooth Highway. Two particular businesses stood out for me, the Yodeler Motel, and Red Lodge Ales. Both companies had made investments in their businesses through the Rural Energy for America Program, and done so on a relatively small scale ¨C yet had seen a direct and positive impact on their operations due to the cost savings from the renewable energy sources. Harnessing the sun's radiant thermal energy to heat water, both the Yodeler and Red Lodge Ales have utilized the water in different ways to benefit their businesses. The Yodeler uses the heated water in their boiler to heat the rooms and common areas of the historic motel on the south end of Red Lodge. Mac Dean of the Yodeler Motel in Red Lodge, Mont. explains the thermal transfer system that supplies the motel's boiler with heated water, providing warmth to the Yodeler's rooms and common areas. Red Lodge Ales takes the pre-heated water, and superheats it to clean their brewing tanks, as well as maintain the necessary heat to brew their beer. It's a prime example of two different businesses using similar technology to harvest the abundant, clean, and free energy around us to benefit not only the businesses themselves ¨C and their bottom line ¨C but to benefit their community and the environment as a whole. I'm proud that USDA Rural Development could play a role in that.

"Deputy Secretary in  USDA Results  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Initiatives  Mar 08,  Rossie Fisher, co-owner of Brookview Farm in Manakin-Sabot, VA. March 8 is International Women's Day. Today, March 8th, is International Women¡¯s Day. What better day to recognize the incredible achievements of women in agriculture? Women have always played a key role on the farm or ranch. Traditionally, women often kept the books and ensured the solvency of the business while men ran the day-to-day production operation. That is still the case in many households, but these days, we are seeing more and more women take a lead role in farm operations as well. In ¨C the year of USDA¡¯s most recent agricultural census ¨C some 30 percent of farm operators in the U.S. were women. That¡¯s a 19 percent increase over the census. Fourteen percent of U.S. farms listed women as the principal operator in , meaning that women made the day-to-day decisions on the farm. (Women listed as farm operators, rather than principal operators, likely run the farm along with a partner or spouse). That¡¯s a 24 percent increase over . Individual states are showing even more involvement of women in farming. Arizona and New Hampshire have the greatest number of farms whose principal operator is a woman; one out of three New Hampshire farms is run by a woman, more than twice the national average. We know that American agriculture is constantly innovating to meet new demands. Women are part of a new wave of innovation in the industry. Women-operated farms tend to be very diverse, producing more vegetables, fruit and nuts, horticultural crops, poultry and sheep or goats than male-operated farms. They are also smaller on average, suggesting that they may engage in more direct-to-consumer sales or sell to local grocers, restaurants, or institutions. These strategies require new, creative business models and innovative production methods. And women are leading the way. As a historically disadvantaged group, women face unique challenges entering agriculture. I¡¯m proud of USDA¡¯s efforts to meet the needs of women farmers through training and business planning programs, mentorship opportunities, support for value-added product development, and our efforts to build strong local food systems through USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative. You can learn more about USDA¡¯s support for women in agriculture by searching for projects on the KYF Compass Map using the search term ¡°women.¡± Today, let¡¯s all take some time to thank women for their hard work on farms, ranches and in rural communities.

For these reasons and more, America¡¯s Harvest Heroes deserve our thanks. A towering, craggy McIntosh apple tree in the center of the orchard at Red Apple Farm in Phillipston, Massachusetts, has weathered 113 winters, borne many tons of crisp, tart apples and fed generations of customers. Planted in , it¡¯s the oldest commercially planted McIntosh tree in New England and possibly the country. Thanks to care by generations of the Rose family, that ancient apple tree still produces fruit today. Al Rose and his wife Nancy, who operate the fourth-generation farm, have introduced an innovative, modern growing system just a stone¡¯s throw from the century McIntosh. To ensure success in an area that sees its share of dry summers, the Roses sought the help of USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). ¡°It may be challenging, but I think we¡¯ve got a natural environment that¡¯s conducive to growing great apples,¡± said Al Rose. ¡°We have cold nights for a good part of the growing season, which are great for the color of the apples. Fall without apples in New England just wouldn¡¯t be the same.¡± A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ¡°We¡¯re at one of the highest elevations for orchards in New England ¨C 1,250 feet,¡± said Rose, standing in the orchard on a windy day. ¡°We have a wind turbine that¡¯s been cranking today. Between that and our solar panels, we¡¯re a red farm and a ¡®green¡¯ farm.¡± Red Apple Farm is protected under the state Agricultural Preservation Restriction (APR) program. ?Through a state grant program to help the viability of APR farms, Rose developed a business plan that called for planting an acre of trees in a new trellis system. ¡°We¡¯re not creating more land here; we have to be more productive on the land that we do have,¡± explained Rose.

Dave Bacon, NRCS Soil Conservationist, has been assisting Red Apple Farm for more than a decade. He explained that, in Massachusetts, the AMA program is used for drought mitigation. ¡°We didn¡¯t want to have an acre¡¯s worth of apple trees fail because there was no irrigation water available,¡± said Bacon. Al Rose stands near the McIntosh tree, planted in . Bacon explained that soil indicated that there was adequate ground water to create a pond, a more reliable water source than drilling a well. With well drilling, there is a risk that there won¡¯t be enough water to meet the plants¡¯ needs.? A micro-irrigation system was installed to deliver water from the pond directly to the young trees. This type of watering system conserves more water than a conventional overhead sprinkler system. ¡°As we slowly change to the newer high production, higher density plantings, it¡¯s going to make us a lot more successful for the current generation and future generations,¡± said Rose. ¡°If you want to do something right, get the experts involved,¡± said Rose.? ¡°NRCS has experts; they know how to do it and they know how to do it right.

"Associate Deputy Administrator for APHIS Animal Care in  Animals  Plants  Jul 14,  Dr. Morgan, pictured here with her horse, Belle, knew at a young age that she wanted to be a veterinarian when, on a road trip with her parents, she saw the horses in Louisville and Lexington. Hello, I¡¯m Dr. Andrea (Andy) Morgan, Associate Deputy Administrator of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)¡¯s Animal Care (AC) program. In , when I hadn¡¯t been out of vet school long and was working at a small animal practice, I got ahold of a brochure about APHIS¡¯ Public Veterinary Practice Career Program. I was interested in working not just with small animals but with other animals, too¡ªexotic animals and horses, to name a few. So I joined APHIS that year, and here I am, still working for the agency 26 years and many important experiences later. My current position involves a lot of strategic planning and working within the program to find ways USDA can be more effective with Animal Welfare Act and Horse Protection Act inspections. Before I joined the AC program, I held a number of positions in APHIS¡¯ Veterinary Services. I served as National Incident Commander for the U.S. response to an Exotic Newcastle Disease outbreak and National Coordinator for the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance program. The most memorable experience I¡¯ve had at APHIS was ensuring the U.S. Equestrian Team horses could travel to the Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. An unidentified equine illness hit New England that year before all of the ates. The European Union (EU) Commission wanted to ban the entry of all U.S. horses into EU Member States. I was a staff vet with APHIS¡¯ National Center for Import/Export, and I had to assure the EU that none of the Equestrian Team horses had been affected by the outbreak. Dr. Morgan shares her insights and perspectives with APHIS employees. For several hours, my EU counterpart Dr. Bernard Van Goethem and I were on the phone and faxing proposals back and forth. Keep in mind this was before e-mail was widely used. We were just two vets, hashing it out across the ocean. Dr. Van Goethem would share the proposals with EU Member States¡¯ Chief Veterinary Officers and get back to me. Eventually, we all agreed on a proposal. I was especially glad to learn that Irish, one of the horses that wouldn¡¯t have made it to Spain without those efforts, won the Olympic bronze medal in show jumping. It¡¯s the coolest thing to negotiate on behalf of the United States, or to make things happen in any number of ways when there¡¯s a problem to solve. Are there challenges when working as a public veterinarian? Always. But it¡¯s like swimming¡ªthere are no standard operating procedures¡ªyou have to just dive in. I¡¯ve learned a lot about myself and my core values in my time at APHIS. This is my legacy.

"APHIS Public Affairs, Riverdale, MD in  Animals  Plants  Feb 01,  Apollo the tiger after being confiscated by APHIS Each year, APHIS protects millions of animals nationwide that are covered by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA).? The Act, and accompanying regulations developed by APHIS, set Federal standards of care for animals that are bred at the wholesale level, used in research, transported commercially, or exhibited to the public.? Under the law, APHIS has the authority and obligation to confiscate any AWA-regulated animal that is in a condition of unrelieved suffering. When APHIS inspectors identify a suffering animal, they intervene quickly on its behalf and make sure the animal gets the care it needs.? First, inspectors will clearly explain to the owner what needs to be done, such as requiring the facility¡¯s veterinarian to tend to an injury or health issue, and then set a short deadline ¡ª usually 24 hours ¡ª for when corrective action must be taken. ?Under the AWA, if proper care is not provided by the deadline, APHIS must ensure that the animal is taken to a facility where it will receive humane care according to Federal standards. While confiscations are rare ¡ª APHIS has conducted nine in the past 3 years ¡ª they require a great deal of planning, effort, and teamwork to be successful.? ¡°It becomes a flurry of activity, and it¡¯s pretty intense,¡± says Dr. Laurie Gage, APHIS¡¯ field specialist for large cats. APHIS Animal Care handles the logistics of animal confiscations, such as locating a new home for the animal and transporting it there. ?USDA¡¯s Office of General Counsel establishes the legal basis for the operation and advises APHIS officials every step of the way.? APHIS¡¯ Investigative and Enforcement Services and USDA¡¯s Office of Inspector General provide security and, when necessary, arrange for a law enforcement presence at the confiscation site to see that the operation goes safely for all involved. Even though they know how emotionally intense and difficult the job will be, USDA confiscation team members work together to get the suffering animal away from its present situation and bring it to a better place.? It¡¯s a mission that¡¯s every bit as rewarding as it is challenging. ¡°It¡¯s incredible to put everything into motion,¡± says APHIS¡¯ Animal Care inspector Lori Linn. ¡°You hardly sleep for days before a confiscation.?

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jun 26,  The National Potato Board¡¯s efforts to increase economic growth and market viability for American potato farmers have had an impact on the industry. In , U.S. potato exports were a record $1.6 billion. America's ag promotion groups work to educate consumers, as well as research and promote our nation¡¯s agricultural products. Whether potatoes or pork, mangos or cotton, soybeans or almonds, ag promotion groups help consumers make informed choices and learn about new products. Although all ag promotion groups do have a similar goal and purpose ¨C to pool their resources to increase demand and long-term economic growth for their? industries ¨C they all accomplish this in different ways, tailoring their efforts to apply strategies that work best for each commodity. The United States Potato Board (USPB) is one of several national ag promotion groups operating under the oversight of USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS).? They are the central organizing force in implementing programs that increase demand for potatoes at home and abroad. This group provides the ideas, information, tools and inspiration for the industry to unite in achieving common goals. Anchored by a strong foundation of market and consumer research and analysis, the USPB domestic and international potato marketing programs include:?advertising, nutrition science, public relations, retail and foodservice marketing, and issues management.?Whether the potato is grown for fresh, frozen, chip, dehydrated or seed use, the USPB is dedicated to positioning potatoes as a nutrition powerhouse¡ªtruly, goodness unearthed.? And all of these efforts mean more economic growth and market viability for American potato farmers. For Fiscal Year (July ¨C June ), U.S. potato exports were a record $1.6 billion, an increase of 4% over FY12 The volume of exports increased 4% to 1,561,896 metric tons, or 66 million hundredweight at the fresh weight equivalent The volume of U.S. exports has increased 26% over the past five marketing years, led by a 62% increase in fresh, a 36% increase in dehydrated and a 17% increase in frozen For the first six months of FY14, the volume of exports of frozen products is up 2%, dehydrated is up 10% and fresh is up 2% The National Mango Board¡¯s (NMB) mission is to increase the demand for fresh mangos in the U.S. by conducting promotion, market and production research. The NMB accomplishes this through three core programs: marketing, research and industry relations. Understanding consumer purchasing behaviors is key to increasing mango consumption in the U.S. The NMB conducts ongoing consumer research to explore consumer awareness, knowledge about mangos, buying habits, barriers to purchase and many other facets of consumer attitudes relative to mangos. ?Results from their consumer research help create, support and guide marketing efforts and messages to increase mango demand. Demand is the most direct and practical way to monitor consumer purchasing behavior since it reflects all of the conditions impacting buying decisions. Most of the changes in the demand for mangos come from attracting new households to buy (market penetration) and far less in changing the number of mangos purchased (market intensity) per buyer. With NMB programs, market penetration increased from under 3% in to over 13% in . Mango availability per capita has increased 53% since to an estimated 2.87 pounds per year in . This means that increased mango sales are related to more consumers perceiving mangos as an option, and much of this is due to NMB¡¯s work.? Through market penetration more consumers are likely to make mangos a routine part of their diets.? By providing promotional information to increase consumer awareness of the fruit, NMB¡¯s efforts convince more potential customers to give them a try. Whether engaging in consumer research, nutrition education or advertising, ag promotion groups help America¡¯s farmers and agribusinesses navigate through marketing challenges, opening doors to new markets and broadening our food options. Results from consumer research conducted by the National Mango Board helps create, support and guide marketing efforts and messages to increase mango demand. Increased consumer demand means economic viability for mango producers, importers and businesses.

"Public Affairs Specialist, USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 28,  Dianilda Rodriguez of GR Management Corp., Arlene Zambrana from USDA Rural Development, and Maria Rodriquez-Collazo of PathStone stand in front of the completed Alturas de Casta?er housing complex in Puerto Rico. In the municipality of Lares, Puerto Rico, lies Alturas de Casta?er, a small, mountainous community that is home to 24 agricultores and their families. The agricultores - or farm workers - work hard year-round to produce coffee, bananas, root vegetables and citrus fruits that are then sold in local markets and to area restaurants. Before coming to the community of Alturas de Casta?er, many families lived in cramped conditions, sometimes with two or three other families.? Conditions were unsanitary and children were constantly sick.? Some homes did not even have roofs, and residents suffered dangerous exposure to the natural elements, including torrential rains during hurricane season. Alturas de Casta?er resident Maria Rodriguez and her husband recall renting a house that they could barely afford. The home was in disrepair, they had to use a ladder as a makeshift set of front steps to their home, and finding snakes and rats in their living space was commonplace. With the help of USDA Rural Development's Farm Labor Housing Program, the Municipality of Lares was able to build an affordable 24-home rental community, Alturas de Casta?er, dedicated solely to farm workers and their families. After moving into this community, living conditions improved dramatically for many residents. Residents like Jomar, an agricultor who uses a wheelchair for mobility; the closets and kitchen in his Alturas de Casta?er home were built for wheelchair accessibility. The community is quiet and clean, the children of the farm workers have a safe place to play, and the homes are well maintained by an experienced management company. It's affordable, too; farm workers living in this community are only to pay 30 percent of their income towards rent. Built in , Alturas de Casta?er was a product of a partnership between USDA Rural Development, Rural Opportunities Puerto Rico, Inc. (ROPRI), an affiliate of PathStone, the Puerto Rico Department of Housing, and the Federal Home Loan Bank. USDA and ROPRI have realized the success of the investment despite the significant challenges in planning and building a community in rural Puerto Rico. USDA and its partners are now looking forward to the development of self-sustaining community gardens which will also support a summer food program for children.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Food and Nutrition  May 16,  Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ¡°organic¡± really means can help consumers make informed choices. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ¡°Made with organic oats and cranberries.¡± A more generic statement like, ¡°Made with organic ingredients,¡± is not allowed. This is the sixteenth installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Deciphering food labels and marketing claims can be a challenge for the average consumer.? Companies use production and handling claims as a way to differentiate their products in the marketplace. Organic is one label that most consumers are familiar with, but understanding what ¡°organic¡± really means can help consumers make informed choices. USDA certified organic products have strict production and labeling requirements. ?The U.S. organic industry is regulated by the National Organic Program (NOP), part of USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service.? Certified organic products are produced without excluded methods such as genetic engineering or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). ?The organic standards are designed to allow natural substances in organic farming while prohibiting synthetic substances. There are four distinct labeling categories for certified organic food products ¨C 100% Organic, Organic, Made with organic ***, and specific organic ingredients.? There are also labeling requirements for organic livestock feed. Today, I wanted to talk more about the ¡°Made with organic***¡± category. Multi-ingredient agricultural products in the ¡°Made with organic ***¡± category must contain at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients (not including salt or water).? These products may contain up to 30 percent of allowed non-organic ingredients. ?All ingredients ¨C including the 30 percent non-organic ingredients ¨C must be produced without GMOs. If a product meets these requirements, its label may include a statement like, ¡°Made with organic oats and cranberries.¡±? A more generic statement like, ¡°Made with organic ingredients,¡± is not allowed. If an ingredient is identified in the ¡°Made with organic ***¡± statement, it must be a truthful claim. This means the product can only contain organic forms of that specific ingredient.?? For example, if the label states ¡°Made with organic corn¡± all raw and processed corn-based ingredients¡ªsuch as blue corn, corn oil, and corn starch¡ªmust be certified organic. The USDA organic regulations provide a set list of ¡°food groups.¡± All raw and processed forms of ingredients in that food group must be certified organic. For example, if a product states, ¡°Made with organic grains,¡± all ingredients derived from grains¡ªsuch as enriched wheat flour, corn oil, or oats¡ªmust be certified organic.? If a product contains both organic and non-organic forms of the same ingredient, they must be identified separately in the ingredient statement. ¡°Made with organic***¡± products can¡¯t use the USDA organic seal, but must identify the USDA-accredited certifying agent. You can look for the identity of the certifier on a packaged product for verification that the product meets USDA¡¯s organic standards.? Certifying agents are accredited by the USDA, and are responsible for ensuring that the USDA organic products meet or exceed all organic standards. The NOP recently put out final guidance on this labeling category to ensure consistency in labeling practices throughout the organic industry.? Consumers purchase organic products expecting that they maintain their organic integrity from farm to market, and USDA is committed to meeting these expectations.?

(USDA Forest Service graphic) In this time of widespread remote learning, USDA Forest Service Experimental Forests and Rangelands bring the mysteries of the forest to the classroom, even when it¡¯s at home. The Experimental Forests and Rangelands network offers lesson plans, videos and other educational material for kids of all ages to learn about things like bird migration, water temperature, or what influences survival of sugar maple seedlings. ¡°Experimental Forests and Rangelands are world-renowned for the depth and breadth of their science and contributions to forest and range management,¡± said Lindsey Rustad, current chair of the Forest Service national Experimental Forests and Rangelands working group. ¡°We are equally proud of our contributions to education and outreach in our efforts to introduce students of all ages ¨C K through gray ¨C to Experimental Forests and Rangelands through lessons and classroom activities.¡± Ellie¡¯s Log, set in H.J. Andrews EFR, is an award winning book and teachers¡¯ guide about phenology in a forest. (USDA Forest Service graphic) Experimental Forests and Rangelands are a vital resource for the Forest Service. Unlike scientific experiments carried out in laboratories, dynamic forest and range ecosystems are complex and not easily controlled. Studying them can be tricky. Fortunately, Experimental Forests and Rangelands offer access to natural testing grounds for exploring puzzling forest and range management issues, such as how to contend with invasive species, wildfire and climate change. The educational materials from Experimental Forests and Rangelands provide a window into some of the research that these sites make possible. Spanning ates, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, they offer an unparalleled opportunity to view local, regional and national environmental change at the continental scale. Besides their comprehensive scope and stunning diversity, another distinguishing feature of Experimental Forests and Rangelands, is the long-term nature of their mission. Some collection efforts stretch back more than 100 years and others are projected to continue for another two centuries. The value of this information is immense, as there are very few comparable opportunities to capture long-term changes on forests and rangelands. Until a few decades ago, scientists and managers could not have predicted they would need to understand the effects of a changing climate on our natural resources. Fortunately, we have the long-term records from Experimental Forests and Rangelands. By giving us the and tools we need to understand large-scale and long-term changes, they continue to help us solve global natural resource challenges.

"Economist at the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in  Food and Nutrition  Jan 13,  Families Projected to Spend an Average of $233,610 Raising a Child Born in . USDA recently issued Expenditures on Children by Families, . This report is also known as ¡°The Cost of Raising a Child.¡± USDA has been tracking the cost of raising a child since and this analysis examines expenses by age of child, household income, budgetary component, and region of the country. Based on the most recent from the Consumer Expenditures Survey, in , a family will spend approximately $12,980 annually per child in a middle-income ($59,200-$107,400), two-child, married-couple family. Middle-income, married-couple parents of a child born in may expect to spend $233,610 ($284,570 if projected inflation costs are factored in*) for food, shelter, and other necessities to raise a child through age 17. This does not include the cost of a college education. Where does the money go? For a middle-income family, housing accounts for the largest share at 29% of total child-rearing costs.? Food is second at 18%, and child care/education (for those with the expense) is third at 16%. Expenses vary depending on the age of the child. As families often need more room to accommodate children, housing is the largest expense. We did the analysis by household income level, age of the child, and region of residence. Not surprising, the higher a family¡¯s income the more was spent on a child, particularly for child care/education and miscellaneous expenses. Expenses also increase as a child ages.? Overall annual expenses averaged about $300 less for children from birth to 2 years old, and averaged $900 more for teenagers between 15-17 years of age. Teenagers have higher food costs as well as higher transportation costs as these are the years they start to drive so insurance is included or a maybe a second car is purchased for them. Regional variation was also observed. Families in the urban Northeast spent the most on a child, followed by families in the urban West, urban South, and urban Midwest.? Families in rural areas throughout the country spent the least on a child¡ªchild-rearing expenses were 27% lower in rural areas than the urban Northeast, primarily due to lower housing and child care/education expenses. Child-rearing expenses are subject to economies of scale. That is, with each additional child, expenses on each declines. For married-couple families with one child, expenses averaged 27% more per child than expenses in a two-child family.? For families with three or more children, per child expenses averaged 24% less on each child than on a child in a two-child family.? This is sometimes referred to as the ¡°cheaper by the dozen¡± effect. Each additional child costs less because children can share a bedroom; a family can buy food in larger, more economical quantities; clothing and toys can be handed down; and older children can often babysit younger ones. Food costs have decreased over the years thanks to increased efficiency in American agriculture. This report is one of many ways that USDA works to support American families through our programs and work. It outlines typical spending by families from across the country, and is used in a number of ways to help support and education American families.? Courts and state governments use this to inform their decisions about child support and foster care payments.? Financial planners use the information to provide advice to their clients, and families can access our Cost of Raising a Child calculator, which we update with every report on our website, to look at spending patterns for families similar to theirs. This Calculator is one of many tools available on MyMoney.gov, a government research and clearinghouse related to financial education. This year we released the report at a time when families are thinking about their plans for the New Year.? We¡¯ve been focusing on nutrition-related New Year¡¯s resolutions ¨C or what we are referring to as Real Solutions - on our MyPlate website, ChooseMyPlate.gov.? This report and the updated calculator can help families as they focus on financial health resolutions.? This report will provide families with a greater awareness of the expenses they are likely to face while raising children. In addition to the report and the calculator, we also have a dedicated section on ChooseMyPlate.gov that provides tips and tools to aid families and individuals in making healthy choices while staying on a budget.

"Director, National Grain Center, GIPSA in  Research and Science  Oct 29,  Sec. Tom Vilsack visited the grain grading laboratory of GIPSA's Board of Appeals and Review (BAR) and the Grading Service Laboratory (GSL) on October 23, . BAR staff explain their grading review process while BAR Chairman Jim Whalen looks on. The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration¡¯s (GIPSA) National Grain Center (NGC) was proud to host Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on Wednesday, October 23.? The NGC, located in Kansas City, MO, is home to the Federal Grain Inspection Service¡¯s (FGIS) Technology and Science Division along with staff from FGIS¡¯ Quality Assurance and Compliance Division and Field Management Division. The grain inspectors, scientists and engineers at the NGC provide a broad spectrum of grain inspection services and support within recently renovated state of the art laboratories.?? During the visit, NGC staff demonstrated how they oversee, develop and approve methods and instruments used for grain inspection that ensure the consistent standard of measuring quality essential to grain marketing. Members of the Board of Appeals and Review (BAR) and the Grading Services Laboratory (GSL) described their critical role within the grain inspection process.? When a grain quality factor is measured through sensory evaluation ¨C how the grain looks or smells ¨C all grain inspectors looking at and smelling the grain sample must be looking for exactly the same thing. Tom Weber, Leader of GIPSA's Trace Analysis Laboratory, explains the process of preparing and testing grain samples for the presence of pesticide residues as Dr. Tim Norden, Chief of GIPSA's Analytical Chemistry Branch, and Mary Alonzo, Director of GIPSA's Technology and Science Division, watch. The BAR¡¯s experienced eyes and noses establish the point where a quality factor impacts a grain sample¡¯s overall grade.? The GSL monitors the accuracy of individual grain inspection results while the BAR monitors the overall grain inspection results against the BAR¡¯s standard of performance.? Both resolve appeals of grain inspection results determined at the initial point of inspection.? The BAR¡¯s interpretation is USDA¡¯s final and binding determination. Equating the process to finding a needle in a haystack, Dr. Tim Norden described how specialized instruments allow his team to analyze grain samples for trace amounts of pesticides and mycotoxins. The results are often used to confirm that U.S. grain meets international limits for these harmful chemicals.? Dr. Norden also emphasized that evolving technology requires that his staff and laboratory constantly maintain their skills. The NGC¡¯s Biotechnology Laboratory develops and validates methods to identify genetic events in grain.? Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief, Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discussed the multi-step process used by her team.? Dr. Bell also emphasized the collaborative nature of biotechnology methods development.? GIPSA¡¯s Biotechnology Proficiency Program, now in its tenth year, collaborates with over 200 laboratories around the world to ensure their ability to accurately detect genetic events.? GIPSA also works closely with other USDA agencies with biotechnology programs. Dr. Tandace Bell, Chief of GIPSA's Biotechnology and Analytical Services Branch, discusses with Secretary Vilsack GIPSA's role in supporting agricultural biotechnology.  Test weight and moisture are the most commonly measured quality factors in all types of grain.???FGIS has developed a prototype for a training tool to improve inspector skills. Secretary Vilsack was able to see that technique does indeed make a difference while trying out a test weight trainer being developed by FGIS.? The test weight trainer measures a grain inspector¡¯s strike off technique against the approved standard.? New and experienced grain inspectors can use it to perfect their technique on this critical measurement. FGIS approved two instruments to measure moisture in all officially graded commodities over the past year.? The Unified Grain Moisture Algorithm (UGMA)-Compatible moisture meters offer improved performance under a wider range of conditions.? Dr. Dave Funk, GIPSA¡¯s Chief Scientist, developed the UGMA algorithm that is the basis of the measurement process of the new meters.? Dr. Funk recounted the development process, and demonstrated how the two machines offer equivalent results. The renovated NGC enhances GIPSA¡¯s ability to certify the accuracy and stability of instruments that measure various quality factors in grain. We all thank Secretary Vilsack for allowing us to show him how the NGC and FGIS support U.S. agriculture. TSD engineer Jason Jordon demonstrated to Secretary Vilsack the proper method for leveling off grain in the kettle used to measure test weight.

"Deputy Administrator of the National Organic Program in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  May 14,  Organic certification cost share programs puts organic certification within reach for farms of all sizes. It is of great value to organic farmers and supports the integrity of the organic label. Consumers are increasingly looking for organic products when they visit the supermarket.? Last year, organic products reached a record number of sales, accounting for over $39 billion in U.S. retail sales.? To meet consumer demand, the industry needs more organic operations to produce everything from organic milk to organic granola bars.? Thanks to support from the Farm Bill, USDA has two cost share programs that assist organic farms and businesses with about $11 million per year in certification assistance¨C making it possible for producers and handlers of all sizes to consider organic certification.? Cost share programs support certified operations across the organic supply chain by making certification more affordable. The USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) administers these programs through grants to participating states. In , USDA funding allowed states to issue nearly 10,000 reimbursements worth more than $6 million, helping the organic community thrive and grow.? ""The U.S. is currently experiencing an explosion of demand for certified organic products and our goal is to see that demand is met by U.S. farmers,¡± said Abby Youngblood, Executive Director of the National Organic Coalition.? ¡°We expect that the organic cost share programs will encourage more U.S. farms to certify and/or add another certification scope to meet this demand."" Cost share programs cover a wide range of certification-related expenses, and cover 75 percent of the cost of each certification, up to a maximum of $750 annually. Here¡¯s how it works: If you¡¯re not yet certified, contact a certifier and get certified. If you are already a certified operation, contact your state agency; Submit your information ¨C a short application and tax form, proof of certification, and itemized expenses; and Get reimbursed by your state agency. ¡°As a small seed company, the cost share program helped make becoming certified organic a reality for us,¡±?said Ken Greene, Founder of the Hudson Valley Seed Library. ¡°We are proud of our certification, what it means about our seeds, and are committed to increasing the diversity and availability of certified organic seed for organic growers.¡± Organic certification lets consumers know that the products they buy meet the USDA organic requirements.?

"Kentucky State Director in  Rural  Jun 09,  Tex Peyton's new home is shown under construction next to the old one. USDA celebrates National Homeownership Month each year in June, and we continue to shine the spotlight on projects across the nation. I wanted to illustrate the work we do to provide ladders of opportunity for rural residents who might not have such an opportunity without the support of USDA Rural Development. I had the pleasure of meeting one such person this week. His name is Tex Peyton and for the past 18 years he lived in a basic two-room house in Eastern Kentucky that lacked indoor plumbing. Thanks to a team of partners that includes USDA Rural Development, Habitat for Humanity, Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and Columbia Pipeline, Peyton now has an affordable energy-efficient house that he is proud to call home ¨C in the community where he grew up in West Liberty. Habitat for Humanity provided the labor to build the home while USDA, along with our partners at Columbia Pipeline and Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, provided the financing for Peyton to purchase it. The house is incredibly energy-efficient and features a Lennox mini-split HVAC system, low e-argon windows and above-standard insulation in the walls, ceiling and floors ¨C building components that will significantly reduce the monthly cost of heating and cooling the home. Persistent poverty counties in Kentucky, like Morgan County where Peyton lives, face challenges that are unique to rural communities. They are often geographically isolated, lack educational opportunities, have high rates of unemployment and are usually underserved ¨C qualities that impede economic opportunity and reduce quality of life. USDA places special emphasis on persistent poverty counties and utilizes a strategy of partnering public resources with local expertise to grow rural economies and create jobs in these poverty-stricken areas. It is because of this emphasis, and the hard work of all our partners, that we had the ability to help Tex Peyton ¨C and the privilege of celebrating with him as he opened his home to us this week. USDA has a proud tradition of assisting rural residents like Tex achieve the dream of homeownership that encompasses more than 60 years. We look forward to continuing that tradition.

"AMS National Organic Program Deputy Director in  Conservation  Jul 30,  To protect the integrity of the organic industry and its products, farms must certify that their operations are following USDA organic regulations. The USDA¡¯s Agricultural Marketing Service offers farms resources to help offset the certification costs. This is the seventh installment of the Organic 101 series that explores different aspects of the USDA organic regulations. Annual organic certification fees allow certifiers to carry out their responsibilities. These fees vary according to an operation¡¯s size and other variables. In light of that, the USDA organic cost share programs help to ensure that these costs don¡¯t discourage those wanting to pursue organic certification. The programs make certification more affordable by reimbursing producers and handlers for as much as 75%¡ªup to a maximum of $750 a year¡ªfor their certification costs. Eligible costs include application fees, inspection fees, travel for certification inspectors, and even postage. ¡°After I figured out how to apply, I found it to be easy,¡± said Gary Philbrick of Philbrick Farms, a Paso Robles, Calif., organization that is certified to produce walnuts. ¡°I just save my receipts and fill out the necessary form and send it in [to the state].¡± State governments administer the organic cost-share funds, appropriated by Congress under the Farm Bill. State governments, usually Departments of Agriculture, work with USDA to administer the program and distribute funds to growers, ranchers, and handlers that are currently certified to the USDA organic regulations. Applicants submit a short form along with proof of certification and an itemized invoice to their state agencies. The state verifies these applications before disbursing funds to eligible organic operations. The program is not competitive, so anyone who is eligible may apply for a reimbursement. ¡°I¡¯m a small farmer, and this program helps me a lot,¡± said Nancy Abramson of Rooster Ridge Farm, a 20-acre operation that devotes one-fifth of its acreage to growing everything from organic citrus to flowers to herbs. ¡°In the beginning, I had a huge fee [getting certified], but the cost share gave me two-thirds of it back. The paperwork is nothing. I think the program is fantastic, and it makes organic farming very affordable for small farmers.¡± Philbrick Farms, based in Paso Robles, Calif., harvests its certified organic walnuts in the fall. With the help of a shaker truck, walnuts fall to the ground and are collected to be sent to the processor for further handling. In particular, smaller operations like Philbrick Farms benefit from USDA¡¯s organic cost share programs, which reimburse producers for as much as 75% of their certification fees. Photo courtesy of Philbrick Farms. When it comes to organic certification, there are many things small growers or handlers have to consider. Affordability is important and often at the top of the list. Organic certification not only fulfills a desired method of farming, but also meets the increased consumer demand for foods farmed and handled organically. ¡°It¡¯s a huge benefit for me that I can advertise that I¡¯m certified organic,¡± said Abramson. ¡°There¡¯s such a marketing plus, and it gets [my product] into grocery stores that require me to be organic.¡± In addition to stocking grocery stores, Abramson takes pride in being able to market her products as organic when selling to consumers at the local farmers market and to the restaurants near her Santa Cruz operation. They all appreciate her organic spinach. The organic cost share program is one of many programs that USDA offers to support emerging, transitioning, or current organic growers and handlers.

"NRCS Oregon in  Conservation  Jan 18,  Sarahlee Lawrence inspects a row of organically grown flowers on her organic farm in the high desert of Central Oregon. Business is blooming for Sarahlee Lawrence and her organic food-and-flower-growing operation, Rainshadow Organics, in the Central Oregon high desert. The 28-year old organic pioneer is proud of her venture and credits USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) as a key component to her success. Lawrence approached NRCS several years ago to start the process of making her farm organic. NRCS helped her plan and implement a nutrient management program and address irrigation issues on both a two-acre vegetable-and-flower plot and a 25-acre field where she grows a mix of cover crops like wheat and clover. NRCS provided assistance to Lawrence through two Farm Bill programs. The Environmental Quality Incentive Program (EQIP) Organic Initiative is a nationwide special effort to provide financial assistance to National Organic Program (NOP) certified organic producers, as well as producers in the process of transitioning to organic production. And the Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP) is a cooperative program to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce energy consumption. Drip irrigation system made possible by the NRCS Agricultural Water Enhancement Program (AWEP). Lawrence is especially pleased with the newly installed drip irrigation system that supplies water to more than 100 varieties of produce and a colorful assortment of flowers on her two-acre parcel. ¡°I could not have afforded or done that by myself,¡± she explains. To be certified organic, a U.S. agricultural operation has to be approved by a USDA Accredited Certifying Agent. Applicants must comply with USDA Organic regulations and submit documentation on their property and farming practices. Transitioning to organic is often a lengthy process, as Lawrence knows. Fields may require preparation to support organic production, including the planting of cover crops, incorporating compost and other soil-enhancing practices. While it takes a while to transition an operation to a Certified Organic one, Lawrence is pleased with her progress. The market for fresh, locally grown food continues to expand in Central Oregon, and her customers include a local hospital, schools and restaurants. Over 100 different types produce are grown on this two-acre organic operation, ranging from beets and beans to cabbage and strawberries. She has also generated a new, dedicated client base through community supported agriculture (CSA). CSA is a way for consumers to directly invest in local farms and receive a regular delivery of fresh fruits, vegetables and other local products.

"Writer, Analytics Center of Excellence, Office of the Chief Information Officer in  Technology  Jun 17,  Hackathon participants use sensors and robotics to create solutions with USDA . Photo credit: BeMyApp The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recently took another step forward on its path to accelerate information technology (IT) modernization and improve how it designs agricultural services and interacts with agricultural producers. This spring, USDA joined technical experts, IT professionals, and application developers for the first hackathon at the Internet of Things (IoT) World Conference in Santa Clara, California. Working collaboratively, the hackathon teams developed new solutions to challenging issues affecting agriculture. What are Hackathons? Hackathons are typically multi-day events where programmers and designers engage in collaborative computer programming. ¡°The goal is not gaining unauthorized access to computer systems, or to necessarily produce a completely polished product,¡± said Andrew Brown, Soil Scientist at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and mentor at the hackathon. ¡°Rather, hackathons focus on innovation, collaboration, and rapid application development.¡± The hackathon was a fitting channel to address key challenges the USDA is working to solve. ¡°Hackathons are a great way to spur innovation and have the potential to solve real issues,¡± said Ted Kaouk, Chief Officer (CDO) for USDA¡¯s Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). ¡°Farmers and ranchers are using from satellites, weather forecasts, sensors, and other technology for more precise agriculture, which is helping to improve agricultural processes on their operation while increasing profits and providing even better protection to the environment.¡± USDA employees supported the hackathon by serving as judges and mentors for the competition. Inside the Hackathon Hackathon participants were challenged to use USDA¡¯s soil, geospatial, and water forecasting to develop IT products that addressed access to water resources and wise water use to support the sustainability, growth, and viability of agriculture. They were to consider the following in their solutions: limited use of broadband in the rural U.S., cybersecurity, and applying machine learning models to make -driven decisions. The hackathon event was preceded by a discovery interlude where participants explored water challenges in agriculture and brainstormed ideas on possible solutions given their shared knowledge of the domain, technology, , and other areas. A webinar one week prior to the event provided an overview of the hackathon and discussion of the datasets, and messaging application, Slack, was used where USDA mentors could answer questions regarding USDA , tools, and resources. The hackathon was a two-day event that included participation from eight teams ranging from two to seven people. During the event, each team gathered around a table to devise a solution while mentors walked around the room to check in, ask questions, and provide guidance. ¡°Mentors worked one-on-one with hackathon participants to help them conceptualize the challenge and apply the datasets,¡± said Brown. ¡°Most participants had an approach in mind and a general goal and needed help with conceptual aspects of interpreting the . Agricultural production systems have fundamental limits and unique considerations that make subject matter expert input very valuable. The mentor cadre¡¯s practical experience in agriculture and environmental problems was critical to helping teams keep their solutions in the realm of possibility.¡± By 1:00 p.m. on the second day, all code needed to be completed. In the afternoon, each team had three minutes to ¡°pitch¡± their solution. Of the eight groups that were formed, three finalists were selected to present their solutions on stage at the ¡°EcoCenter System Stage¡± located on the Expo Center floor. After the judges reviewed the presentations, Carlos Suarez, NRCS State Conservationist for California, announced ¡°Team Smart Ag¡± as the winner and presented them with the hackathon trophy. Team Smart Ag¡¯s Winning Solution Team Smart Ag developed a low-cost, low-power smart-farming solution that would enable farmers to use devices to monitor a variety of conditions, such as water needs for crops and livestock health. The open-source, conversational artificial intelligence (AI) platform includes a phone application that allows farmers to ask questions, such as ¡°Where do I need to water today?¡±. Team Smart Ag also created a 3D visualization of a hypothetical farm to provide a first-person view of the land, so farmers can locate runoff and areas that need water. In addition to winning the hackathon trophy, Team Smart Ag received prizes valued at $15K total, which included an interview with ITPro Today and opportunities to present their winning solution at highly-visible events at the conference. Hackathons as Part of IT Modernization Model The hackathon follows the White House¡¯s push toward IT modernization through the new Center of Excellence (CoE) model. The model has five focus areas: cloud adoption, IT infrastructure optimization, customer experience, service delivery analytics, and contact centers. USDA, which has been designated a CoE, is using this new model to support the improved use of IT resources throughout the department.

"NRCS Mississippi in  Conservation  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Jul 13,  The Stoltzfuses use high tunnels to lengthen the growing season for fresh fruits and vegetables. They built the first high tunnel on their own, and they liked it so much, they decided to build a second one with the help of NRCS.  For many farmers, the lessons of agriculture begin at a young age. This is true for Florence, Miss., farmer Kathy Stoltzfus, who says that her dad taught her what she knows when she was a child. She has fond memories of running barefoot through rice fields and the taste of freshly grown food. Now Stoltzfus and her husband, Bob, run a small farm in central Mississippi, where they raise fruits, vegetables and eggs. Her farming experience, coupled with his grocer experience, makes them a powerhouse at the Mississippi Farmers Market in Jackson, where they sell many different vegetables, including a variety of greens, broccoli, onions, radishes, peas, tomatoes, squash and zucchini. Their eggs are a hit, selling out every Saturday at the market. The Stoltzfuses started selling at the farmer¡¯s market as part-time farmers in , but two years later, the couple decided that they would leave their day jobs to farm full-time. While operating a small farm is hard work, they are happy with their successes and grateful for help from USDA¡¯s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency that helps private landowners implement conservation to protect the environment and improve productivity. They learned about NRCS from a fellow producer at the market who told them about the technical assistance and cost-share assistance offered by the agency. Through NRCS¡¯ Environmental Quality Incentives Program, their farm is on pace to be certified as organic as early as the end of this year. NRCS also worked with the couple to build a seasonal high tunnel to keep their fruits and vegetables safe from the cold weather and construct a wildlife fence to protect their crops from hungry deer and rabbits. Bob and Kathy Stoltzfus (center) are working with NRCS conservationists Malcolm Lowe (left) and Mark Scott (right) to make their Florence, Miss. farm more productive. High tunnels have a metal frame wrapped in plastic and are easy and fairly cheap to build. They are designed to extend the growing season into the cold months, helping to increase productivity, keep plants at a steady temperature and even conserve water and energy. NRCS funds high tunnels as part of USDA¡¯s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, launched in to help local food systems thrive. The Stoltzfuses plan to continue enlarging their operation. With 32 acres at their disposal, they hope to start a small beef cattle operation. Both say that they¡¯re doing what they¡¯re meant to do. Bob enjoys the quiet of the countryside, and Kathy is happy to have returned to her heritage. Learn more about the Environmental Quality Incentives Program Follow NRCS on Twitter.

"Director of National Organic Program in  Conservation  Sep 21,   The Department of Agriculture (USDA) was all ears on Tuesday as it opened up its hall to organic stakeholders to ask the question, ¡°What activities should the Department focus on to serve the organic community?¡± Many took the opportunity to respond. During a day-long listening session hosted by USDA, organic stakeholders shared their thoughts, concerns, praises, and requests with the department that administers the organic certification program and enforces the country¡¯s organic standards. The USDA¡¯s National Organic Program, part of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), currently serves a $29 billion industry on a budget of less than $7 million¡ªand the industry continues to grow amidst challenging economic conditions.

USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. This challenge served as an important backdrop for USDA to hear feedback from the community on how the agency could prioritize its resources and shape future workplans related to organic agriculture and markets. Anchoring the panel of listeners were Mark Lipson, organic policy advisor to the Secretary and key coordinator of the department¡¯s organic agenda, and myself, as well as a host of rotating officials who represented agencies like the Foreign Agriculture Service, which engages in trade negotiations to expand agricultural product exchange with other countries, and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, which administers the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP). A full spectrum of topics was covered during the day. Some shared their concerns about effects of genetic engineering on their businesses (genetic modification is an excluded method in the organic standards). Some emphasized the need to continue international negotiations that would facilitate trade and expand markets for their organic products. Some recognized the value of small farmers in organic sector innovation. Others highlighted the vital role of NOP enforcement in ensuring organic integrity. And still others highlighted the importance of engaging a new generation of farmers and expressed their support of programs that help alleviate the cost of certification. The wide range of topics and the people who shared them speak to the unique market value of USDA organic and the desire of organic stakeholders to protect the integrity of the seal. A transcript of the listening session will be available on the AMS website soon.

"Risk Management Agency Administrator in  Rural  Jul 21,   USDA¡¯s Risk Management Agency (RMA) and Farm Service Agency (FSA) working together have made great strides in making acreage reporting simpler for farmers and ranchers. ?The Acreage and Crop Reporting Streamlining Initiative (ACRSI), seeks to reduce the reporting burden on producers submitting to USDA. In listening sessions with producers last year, FSA and the Office of the Chief Information Officer found some common themes emerged: 1) Producers want to provide their information such as acreage reporting , just once, and expect USDA agencies to share the internally -¡®one-stop¡¯ reporting; 2)? Producers currently provide the same information multiple times; and 3)? Acreage reporting is inefficient and is not always accurate ACRSI will standardize requirements and automate the reporting process.?

"Legislative and Public Affairs, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in  Animals  Jun 01,  If you are moving this year from a location within the gypsy moth quarantine area to a location outside the quarantine area, please inspect outdoor household items for pests. This is a federal requirement for homeowners moving from gypsy moth quarantine areas. By complying with the law, you may also save a forest. Gypsy moths are destructive, invasive pests! European gypsy moth larvae feed on over 300 plant species including oak, aspen and elm. Gypsy moths have defoliated more than ates since . About 70% of susceptible forests have never been infested and are at risk. Male gypsy moths are brown and smaller than female gypsy moths, which are primarily white. Females lay fuzzy yellowish-brown egg masses from which caterpillars emerge bearing distinctive red and blue dots. Like many invasive insects, gypsy moths can spread long distances with human assistance. They are notorious hitchhikers and lay their eggs on patio furniture, grills, lawn mowers, children¡¯s toys, and other outdoor items. Larvae can hide on untreated firewood or other wooden items such as pallets and crates. The good news is you can help stop them. If you are moving, use the self-inspection checklist (, 3.6 ) and remove any insects or egg masses you find. To learn more about protecting your neighborhood and how you can help, visit USDA¡¯s Your Move Gypsy Moth Free website.

"Coordinator, USDA Caribbean Climate Hub in  Climate  Nov 09,  Four years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated the Caribbean, there is still an urgency to understand how to best prepare farmers and working lands for future hurricanes. Agricultural advisors are first responders and witnesses of hurricane impacts and strategies used in hurricane preparedness and recovery. A new study by the USDA Caribbean Climate Hub analyzes the experiences of agricultural advisors involved in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma and Maria in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to identify gaps in hurricane preparedness and recovery measures. ¡±Climate projections indicate the Caribbean will experience more intense hurricanes, which will increase the challenges to agriculture and food security. There is an urgent need to improve hurricane preparedness to minimize hurricane effects on the agricultural sector in the Caribbean,¡± said Dr. Nora ¨¢lvarez-Berr¨ªos, the study¡¯s lead author. The research team surveyed over 200 advisors from eight institutions who reported on the difficulties farmers face in the recovery process, including lack of supplies such as seeds, fertilizers and animal feed, lack of equipment and machinery for clean-up, impaired access to farms, and the need to expedite government assistance to meet farmers¡¯ needs. Importantly, advisors indicated that while farmers and ranchers do apply recovery practices, the application of short-term preparedness practices is limited, and long-term preparedness practices are generally uncommon. The advisors also reported on the challenges they face in assisting farmers, such as the inability to access farms, transportation issues, and lengthy times to reach farmers. They highlighted the need for more training and educational resources to improve hurricane recovery response, and more tools to help farmers cope with emotional distress post-disaster. The Caribbean Hub disseminates information on hurricane preparedness and best management practices to help reduce risks and mitigate hurricane effects.

"Pollinators like honeybees, butterflies, birds, bats and other animals are hard at work providing vital but often unnoticed services. They pollinate crops like apples, bananas, blueberries, strawberries, melon, peaches, potatoes, vanilla, almonds, coffee and chocolate. Pollinators by Numbers Three-fourths of the world¡¯s flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world¡¯s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. That¡¯s one out of every three bites of food you eat. More than 3,500 species of native bees help increase crop yields. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators like bees, butterflies and moths, birds and bats, and beetles and other insects. The Pollinator Partnership The Pollinator Partnership offers 32 different planting guides to improve pollinator habitat, each one tailored to a specific ecoregion in the United States. Each guide is filled with an abundance of native plant and pollinator information. Enter your zip code to find your planting guide. How Animal Pollination Works Pollinators visit flowers in their search for food (nectar and pollen). During a flower visit, a pollinator may accidentally brush against the flower¡¯s reproductive parts, unknowingly depositing pollen from flower to flower. The plant uses the pollen to produce a fruit or seed. Many plants cannot reproduce without pollen carried to them by foraging pollinators. Pollinators Are in Trouble You may have heard that bees are disappearing and bats are dying. These and other animal pollinators face many challenges in the modern world. Habitat loss, disease, parasites, and environmental contaminants have all contributed to the decline of many species of pollinators. Pollinators that can¡¯t find the right quantity or quality of food (nectar and pollen from blooming plants within flight range) don¡¯t survive. Right now, there simply aren¡¯t enough pollinator friendly plantings to support pollinators. Learn more about how USDA is helping pollinators. Learn more about these pollinators: Bats Butterflies Helpful Hint: Did you know dandelions are the first food for bees emerging in the spring. Leave them in your yard and feed the bees! Dandelion petals and leaves are also edible and can be used in salads. You Can Help Pollinators You can help pollinators in your garden at home. Pollinators make use of food and habitat anywhere it is found, whether on roadsides, in a schoolyard garden or a planter on a windowsill. Here¡¯s how:  Complete a Wildlife Assessment. One of the first steps in creating new habitat for pollinators is to first assess and evaluate your existing space. Habitat assessments can be great tools to identify practices where you can improve or confirm good practices you already have in place. The Xerces Society has several different habitat assessment guides for different types of landscapes or specific insects. The Habitat Assessment Guide for Pollinators in Yards, Gardens, and Parks is a great resource for small and urban sites, including urban farms. The Pollinators: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and Beneficial Insects: Farms and Agricultural Landscapes and two other great options for assessing agricultural lands. For more information on providing ground, stem, and cavity nesting sites and overwintering sites, be sure to check out Xerces guide on Nesting & Overwintering Habitat for Pollinators & Other Beneficial Insects.  Types of Habitat. There are several habitat opportunities and strategies you can use to invite pollinators into your urban farms, gardens, or yards. Pollinator habitat can beautify your space, increase native biodiversity, increase pollination services and biological control of ¡°pest¡± insects, and provide community engagement and learning opportunities. Often for smaller scale gardens in urban areas, plugs or transplanted plants from pots are preferred over pure live wildflower seeds.  Plant Native Plants. Native plants are considered the best choice because of their abundance of nectar and pollen in addition to being low maintenance, generally pest free, drought tolerant, and ability to control erosion. They are good sources of food and shelter for wildlife, and naturally beautiful.  Plant a continuous food supply. Make sure you have at least 3 different species throughout the spring, summer, and fall seasons to provide adequate food when pollinators emerge from and prepare for winter hibernation. Plant in groupings (clumps) of each plant species for a greater impact.  Include a diversity of plants. Different flower sizes, shapes and , as well as varying plant heights and growth habits, support a greater number and diversity of pollinators. Include a combination of native plant species, heirloom plants and herbs in your pollinator garden. Common herbs such as rosemary, oregano, basil, marjoram, and borage are excellent pollinator plants. Allow unharvested fruits and vegetables to bolt (go to flower) for added pollinator and beneficial insect food.  Limit or eliminate use of pesticides. A healthy garden with the appropriate plant species and an abundance of pollinators will support natural beneficial insects¡ªreducing the need for pest control.   Install bat boxes. Bats are also pollinators that need our help. Leave snags for habitat or install a bat box. Learn more about the benefits of bats!  Spread Awareness. Educate others about the importance of pollinators and share how you planted for bees, butterflies, birds and other animals at home.

The Biden-Harris Administration and Secretary Vilsack have made it a priority to better meet our federal trust and treaty responsibilities. Historically, the U.S. government played a significant role in the decimation of the buffalo population in the North American continent, with a policy of destroying buffalo in order to starve Native Americans into submission. We recognize the weight of these actions and our obligation to better support tribes in restoring buffalo across their lands. On Monday, June 6, my colleagues at FNS, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), Rural Development, Agricultural Marketing Service, and the USDA Office of Tribal Relations, and I were honored to be invited by the InterTribal Buffalo Council (ITBC) and members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to participate in a traditional buffalo slaughter and field harvest. ITBC is a coalition of 69 federally recognized tribes that has led the work to restore buffalo to Indian Country since . Our traditional harvest was led by Lisa and Arlo Iron Cloud who work with Makoce Agriculture Development, an Indigenous agriculture organization led by Nick Hernandez on Pine Ridge. Ms. Iron Cloud is also partnering with USDA¡¯s Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative to help create resources on sustainable, Indigenous food foraging practices. This ¡°hands-on¡± experience was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for which we are so grateful to Lisa, Arlo, the ITBC, and the Oglala Lakota Nation Tribal leadership to get a glimpse into the cultural, spiritual, and practical contributions of buffalo to the Lakota people. We saw first-hand the importance of providing opportunities for American Indian children to engage in hands-on nutrition education about buffalo and to be able to taste and regularly eat buffalo as part of their school meals. FNS has worked to address some of the barriers that make it challenging for schools to serve buffalo, but we recognize that we must do more. We look forward to continuing to partner with ITBC and tribal leaders to advance Indigenous food sovereignty priorities and restore buffalo in Indian Country.

"USDA NASS Public Affairs Specialist in  Research and Science  Jun 16,  Farming is hot! From sweet corn to watermelon and apricots to tomatoes, a lot is growing on the farm this summer. Millions of producers across our nation continue to work tirelessly to produce safe and delicious food. According to the latest Census of Agriculture, more than a quarter of these producers are new and beginning farmers, proving that many people are unable to resist agriculture¡¯s magnetic appeal. USDA defines a beginning farmer as anyone who has farmed for 10 years or less. In , the United States had 908,274 producers who identified as beginning farmers, and they accounted for 27% of the country¡¯s 3.4 million producers. How old are these new farmers? The average age of a beginning farmer is 46.3, much younger than the average age of all farmers . Without a doubt, the art and science of producing food attracts people of all ages. If we look for younger farmers, we find 26% of beginning farmers are under the age of 35. The under 35 age group represents only 8% of all U.S. farmers overall. Will more young people find a match in farming as time goes on? Look for an update in the Census of Agriculture. States with the largest share of beginning farmers are mostly on the east and west coasts. However, just as Texas is the state with the most farms and the most producers, Texas leads in the number of beginning farmers.

(U.S. Forest Service photo) More than 300 people gathered on in 25-degree weather to witness the harvesting of the 88-foot Capitol Christmas Tree from the Colville National Forest, the first step in its 5,ate to the U. S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. More than a dozen spotters and equipment operators manipulated the tree into position as the Mack Truck pushed the trailer underneath. The enormity of the Engelmann spruce became apparent as the tree floated above the trailer while a few extra feet from the trunk had to be removed. Every December, the Speaker of the House hosts a lighting ceremony on the U.S. Capitol grounds. With a simple flip of a switch roughly 10,000 lights bring the tree to life. But first it has to make the journey. The progression of the tree across the country may be tracked on the Capitol Christmas Tree website, on their Facebook page and @CapitolTree on Twitter.

The cost of moving the tree, providing ornaments and hosting various events is covered by a non-profit organization dedicated to the event. Forest Service employees provide support as part of their duties. The U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree is a gift from the people, and the commemorative ornaments are the result of a partnership between Columbia Cedar Inc. and Colville, Wash., High School.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 14,  In a staging area, workers carefully begin the process of wrapping the tree to protect it during the 5,000-mile journey from Colville National Forest to the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. (U.S. Forest Service photo) The 88-foot Engelmann spruce tree that will grace the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol as a gift from the people must first get from Colville National Forest in Washington State to Washington, D.C. That means careful packing with special attention paid to cocooning the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree so the thick branches stay intact and nothing hangs over the side of the trailer it is placed on. ¡°What does it take to wrap an 88-foot-tall Engelmann spruce?¡± said Franklin Pemberton of the Colville National Forest. ¡°Also a lot of hard-working volunteers, 4,000 feet of parachute cord with a 550-pound breaking strength and a huge building.¡± The tree wrapping process started at the harvest area on the Colville. Two large industrial cranes gently lowered the tree onto a custom-made cradle atop a special tractor trailer. ¡°The longest of the branches were tied up so they wouldn¡¯t drag on the road for the trip from the harvest site to the Newport (Wash.) celebration and then to the wrapping site,¡± Pemberton said. More than ate to help prep the tree for the journey. ¡°Once at the wrapping site, this is where the sticky, prickly and labor-intensive part of the process starts,¡± he said. ¡°Volunteers start to move the branches towards the center of the tree, using ratcheting straps to move the larger branches into place near the trunk so that the tree will fit inside its protective box trailer.¡± Keeping the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree from drying out is important during the 5,000-mile trip from Washington State to Washington, D.C. The end of the trunk is wrapped with a 40-gallon bladder that is refreshed throughout the trip. The tree needs more than 50 gallons of water each day to stay fresh. (U.S. Forest Service photo) Once those branches are tucked as close as they will go to the trunk, volunteers tie the branches in place with the parachute cord. While doing this, the trees pitch, or sap, covers the volunteer¡¯s hands, clothes and hair making for a sticky, but pleasant smelling ordeal. Once tucked away, the tree is cocooned by aluminum frame and plywood siding. Hoops straddle the top to provide support and protection for a decorative tarp. The only exposed parts of the tree can be seen through three viewing windows. Two of the windows will let onlookers see the top of the tree decorated with lights and a few of the thousands of ornaments created by children in Washington State. The third viewing area will give visitors a chance to see the 40-gallon bladder used to keep the thirsty tree moist and healthy along its trip. The tree will stop in 22 cities on the way to the Capitol. The tree is expected to arrive at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland on Nov. 24. On Nov. 25, the tree will be escorted into Washington, D.C. A tree lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 3. The tradition of a Christmas tree on the U.S. Capitol lawn began in . The first several years live trees were planted but did not thrive. In , the Capitol Architect asked the Forest Service for help. Since then, a national forest is chosen each year, and residents of the state where the forest in located work together with partners throughout the state to take care of a variety of logistical needs. The community buildup starts roughly a year in advance as a grass-roots community effort to give the gift to all Americans, which is why it is dubbed ¡°The People¡¯s Tree.¡± No tax dollars are used. However, Forest Service employees are assigned to help oversee the project. Follow the tree¡¯s journey. The Capitol Christmas Tree arrives in Colville, Wash. on its cross-country trip. The flatbed trailer is framed to keep the branches of the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree protected for its long journey from Washington State to Washington, D.C. Plywood completes the cocooning, and a special section at the top of the tree is equipped with decorated ¡°windows¡± to allow the public to catch a glimpse during stops along the way.

"Gopher Tortoise Habitats Thrive along Alabama's Gulf Coast  Longleaf pine forests once dominated the Southeast. But over the past two centuries, many of these forests have disappeared along with the wildlife that called them home. Recent efforts to enhance longleaf forests on private lands are helping the ecosystem rebound as well as wildlife like the gopher tortoise. The gopher tortoise is a keystone species of the longleaf forest, known for their deep burrows that provide vital habitat and shelter for not only itself but many other species.

"Posted by USDA in  USDA Results  Oct 22,   October 20 marked the official launch of the Combined Federal Campaign (CFC) at USDA for the Washington, D.C. metro area. Administered by the government¡¯s Office of Personnel Management (OPM), CFC is the world¡¯s largest workplace giving program. Since its inception in , federal employees have contributed more than $6 billion to the non-profit community. This year, USDA has set a goal of raising just under $2 million from its approximately 10,000 employees in the national capital area. The official kickoff on Tuesday morning was an exciting event in the Whitten Building patio featuring top USDA leadership and more than 20 CFC registered non-profit organizations. Secretary Tom Vilsack and Undersecretary for Research, Education, and Economics, Dr. Raj Shah, led off the event by speaking movingly about the ways that non-profit organizations touch all of our lives in critical and transformative ways. Dr. Shah spoke about incredible array of non-profits that participate in CFC, from groups doing lifesaving work fighting malaria in Africa to charities feeding hungry people right here in Washington, D.C. Secretary Vilsack spoke about his own birth in a Catholic orphanage, saying that he probably would not be here today if not for the nuns who took care of him and his birth mother. Both stressed the importance of giving generously this year more than ever, as the worldwide economic crisis has dramatically increased the needs of the non-profit community even as donations to the sector have fallen off. Secretary Vilsack emphasized that as federal workers, we have all been blessed with good jobs, and that CFC is a wonderful opportunity to share that blessing with people in need. After Secretary Vilsack¡¯s remarks, he officially opened the campaign by handing in his own completed pledge form. Dr. Shah and much of USDA¡¯s senior leadership followed suit, as the assembled USDA employees watched a video message from President Obama. The President encouraged all federal employees to give generously to CFC this year, as part of the same spirit of service and community that he has worked to strengthen across the country through United We Serve. As the first phase of the kickoff drew to a close, Bernadine Prince of FARMFRESH Markets spoke about her organization¡¯s work to promote locally grown food throughout the DC Metro area. When Ms. Prince finished her remarks, it was time for the attendees to sample some of the fresh, locally grown food from USDA¡¯s very own Farmers Market, such as apple cider and banana bread. Before attendees enjoyed the delicious and healthy refreshments, Dr. Susan McCarthy from the Agricultural Research Service, USDA¡¯s CFC Campaign Manager, launched the charity fair. This fair was an excellent opportunity for USDA employees to talk to representatives of a few of the thousands of non-profits represented in the CFC catalog. Employees who attended reported having a wonderful time and learning a great deal about non-profits doing great work in a wide variety of ways. The Secretary is hoping that all employees will join him in giving to the non-profit organizations of their choice. The size of the gift matters much less than the fact that each employee participates on some level.

It would be difficult for a traveler not to find a site worthy of a great painting or a great photograph. USDA Photo by Bob Nichols. One of the best destinations to visit in New England is the White Mountain National Forest, with its campgrounds, hiking trails, scenic drives, beautiful landscapes and world renowned fall foliage. The forest has recently been adopted by the National Forest Foundation as one of its “Treasured Landscapes,” for its on-the-ground restoration needs due to damage from flooding, woody debris, sediment and erosion caused by Tropical Storm Irene in . In , the Foundation launched its Treasured Landscapes, Unforgettable Experiences campaign to focus on building public-private partnerships in support of large-scale forest and watershed restoration across America’s National Forest System and community engagement. This campaign is concentrated in 14 iconic sites from Alaska to Florida, with the White Mountain National Forest becoming one of the campaign’s newest sites this year. “This new partnership with the Foundation, allows us to continue ongoing watershed restoration, repair trails and bridge damage, and address any spread of invasive plan species caused by the storm” said White Mountain National Forest Supervisor Tom Wagner. Perhaps your next stop during the fall or winter season will be the White Mountain National Forest. Whether you’re a returning or first-time visitor, you must explore this “Treasured Landscape” in New England. NOTE: Recent weather events have impacted some national forests on the East Coast. Campgrounds, roads and trails may be closed because of the storm. Visitors are advised to call ahead to the local ranger district office to find out about forest openings and closures before setting out on a trip.  The National Forest Service has waived fees during the Veterans Day Holiday weekend. To learn more click here.

"Shawnee National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jan 31,  The Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom. Youngsters will have an opportunity to enjoy the Shawnee National Forest, like the kids here at the Young Trekkers afterschool program. Photo used with permission. With declining budgets in the public school system, there has been a steady decrease in school fieldtrips in recent years. This plight further widens the disconnect between children and nature. To help bridge the gap between the schoolroom and the natural world, the Shawnee National Forest will offer a new school program this year called Naturalist in the Classroom.  The program will be piloted to third- through fifth-grade students in Union and Alexander counties located in southern Illinois, and will focus on two themes – forest ecology and wetland ecology. Forest Service employees will visit the classroom several times during the semester to cover topics, such as the role of water, the function of wetlands, forest functions, and tree identification, or subjects identified by the teacher.  Naturalist in the Classroom will culminate in a one-day field trip at a Forest Service site with Forest Service natural resource and conservation education professionals to show students how what they learned applies in the field and in national forest management. There will be hands-on activities and games from various national curriculums, such as Project Learning Tree, Project Aquatic Wild and WOW! Wonders of Wetlands will be used. Naturalist in the Classroom aims to strengthen and expand the Shawnee’s environmental education program, get kids outdoors, and assist local educators in meeting Illinois’ learning standards.  Schools benefitting from the program are located in areas with high unemployment and have some of the highest underserved populations in southern Illinois. “We are really excited about implementing this new program in local schools,” said Allen Nicholas, forest supervisor at Shawnee National Forest.  “There are so many barriers to getting children in the outdoors these days.  We hope the Naturalist in the Classroom project will be the bridge in getting kids into the outdoors, as well as connecting them to the expertise of our natural resource professionals.” The spring application deadline is Feb. 5; the fall application deadline is Sept. 5.

ARS photo  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from the USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. News by USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) indicates that moving dairy cows out of climate-controlled barns and onto the land may help to lessen the ecological impact of dairy farming without any corresponding loss of production. A team of ARS scientists in University Park, Pa., conducted a modeling study that evaluated how different management systems on a typical 250-acre Pennsylvania dairy farm would affect the environment.  The scientists collected a range of field and input it into their model to evaluate the environmental dynamics of four different dairy farms in all types of weather over 25 years. All four systems were set to produce the same amount of milk, adjusting for fat and protein, on the same land.  The model generated estimates for ammonia emissions from manure, impact on the soil including erosion and leaching of nitrates, and phosphorus losses from field runoff. Total emissions for the greenhouse gases methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide were 8 percent lower in year-round outdoor production than with cows tucked away in the barn.  Keeping dairy cows outdoors all year reduced the dairy operation’s ammonia emissions by about 30 percent. While barn-bound cows were estimated to each produce 22,000 pounds of milk per year, compared to only 13,000 pounds per foraging cow, the total amount of milk protein and fat produced was essentially the same.  That’s because the foraging cows produced milk that contained more fat and protein.

"Feed the Future: Together We Can  This week, USDA was honored to join forces with USAID and Islamic Relief USA to host the department’s 4th annual Iftar celebration. The event welcomed over 170 guests, including representatives from humanitarian organizations, faith-based groups and federal employees.  This year’s Iftar called attention to the importance of reducing food insecurity abroad with the theme “Feed the Future: Together We Can.” Iftar is an evening gathering held each year during Ramadan.  A time of spiritual cleansing in the Islamic faith, Ramadan is when Muslims fast, abstaining from food and water from sunrise until sunset. Iftar is the meal at which Muslims break their fast each night. For many Muslims, fasting is an act of empathy towards those around the world who go hungry not by choice, but instead by circumstance.

"Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics in  Research and Science  Nov 04,  Dr. Woteki works with 4-H members. The past eight years have been an extraordinary time for agricultural science, and for the application of new insights from other fields to enhance agricultural productivity and the overall agricultural economy. As the final days of this administration are approaching, it gives me a great deal of pride to look back at what USDA has accomplished in the areas of research and innovation. Scientific research is a fundamental part of our mission at USDA. But, ultimately, what's behind all the science is people – people who do the research and people who are affected by it. As USDA's Chief Scientist and Under Secretary for Research, Education and Economics, I've met and worked with both as I've traveled across the country and around the world. I've seen the dedication and innovation of researchers at a USDA laboratory in California as they developed uses for drones and laser-guided sprayers as part of a ""precision agriculture"" movement. Their work allows the wise, efficient application of water and chemicals – as well as increased crop yields – in drought-ridden areas. I've seen the confident, solitary efforts of a Cornell University professor in the field of urban aquaponics who, with USDA funding, proved that he can not only raise 10,000 tilapia in fish tanks housed in the unlikely location of a high school basement in midtown Manhattan, but could then recirculate the fish tank water to nourish a thriving edible garden a few floors up in the school building. And I've seen the eagerness reflected in the faces of two young girls taking part in 4-H National Science Day activities in the nation's capital, applying science and technology skills and equipping themselves to possibly become part of the next generation of leaders in agricultural science. These people, and so many before them, embody the commitment to scientific innovation that is a major reason why Americans have not had to worry about food security since the Dust Bowl days of the s. To learn more about USDA's important scientific work, I invite you to take a few minutes to take a look at our results over the past eight years in our USDA Medium Chapter 11: Food and Ag Science Will Shape Our Future. The 21st Century has been referred to as the “Century for Biology,” and we are witnessing the applications of our heightened understanding of genes and gene traits to enhance crops and livestock. These applications, in turn, have been integral to USDA efforts like the transfer of germplasm and new plant varieties to the private sector here in the U.S. We are helping, through USDA’s partnership with the Agency for International Development and the “Feed the Future” initiative, in delivering UG99-resistant wheat varieties and improving the nutritional content of legumes—two examples of how our research and innovation are being applied to help improve food security around the world. Our work has been informed by projections that our global population will reach over 9.5 billion people by the year . To adequately feed that number of people would require an almost doubling of the world’s current level of agricultural production and a reduction in food loss and waste, at the same time the amount of farmable land is decreasing. As we continue to learn about the effects of a changing climate, our focus is on sustainably intensifying agricultural production to deliver the array of foods to provide for good health and foods that are free of disease-causing pathogens and toxins. We have developed a vision of a bioeconomy that by the year will produce a billion tons of biomass – agricultural residues, grasses, energy crops, forestry trimmings, algae and other sources – that will provide alternative sources of fuel, energy and other bioproducts. We have also focused research on developing agricultural systems that will be able to provide all of these services and be resilient in the face of climate change. Over the last eight years. We have faced numerous challenges and the results have been remarkable. There is still much to do, but we have left a solid foundation for continuing USDA’s work to support the American agricultural economy, to strengthen rural communities, to protect and conserve our natural resources, and to provide a safe, sufficient, and nutritious food supply for the American people.

On November 22, the United States and Israel came one step closer to renewing agricultural research and development activities that could produce new knowledge and innovations beneficial to both countries and increase the economic bottom line for farmers and ranchers. Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy, director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and Edo Chalutz, executive director of the U.S.–Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund (BARD), signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to promote collaboration via NIFA among U.S. and Israeli scientists and engineers. BARD and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), USDA’s intramural research agency, have cooperated on research together since BARD’s inception. While the MOU does not obligate either agency to specific funding, it offers the framework for facilitating collaborations through the partnership that BARD and the U.S. government have shared since . “The United States and Israel have a shared stake in dryland agriculture, high-value horticultural crops, and pest management. There should be ample opportunity for American and Israeli scientists to jointly continue to advance these and other important areas of science,” Ramaswamy said. One example of cooperation between the nations is water and soil management. Efficiency in water use is of particular interest since the Israelis have worked for years in to develop drip irrigation and have grappled with issues of soil salinity. Many U.S. scientists are conducting similar research, so this may be an area where the MOU could strengthen or begin new collaborative efforts. “This agreement will facilitate many mutual benefits, and we look forward to getting started,” Ramaswamy said. “In fact, we plan to use this MOU as a model for building other important global partnerships.” Through federal funding and leadership for research, education, and Cooperative Extension programs, NIFA focuses on investing in science and solving critical issues impacting people's daily lives and the nation's future.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Aug 22,  USDA’s Agricultural Research Service and Purdue University researchers are working together to develop biological controls that protect against white grubs, which eat turf grass roots. During the U.S. Open held this summer in Erin Hills, Wisconsin, some of the world’s top golfers competed for a shot at becoming the champion (won by Brooks Koepka). The course’s meticulously groomed putting greens and fairways—like those of so many other golf facilities—are an inspiration to lawn-care enthusiasts near and far. But professional golf course superintendents and lawn-loving homeowners alike face a common foe: chubby, C-shaped pests called “white grubs,” which eat the turf grass roots. Unchecked, they cause brown spots or barren patches that mar the turf’s aesthetic value and even playability. Robert Behle isn’t an avid golfer, and you won’t find him competing with his neighbors for the best-looking lawn. But he does know a thing or two about insects—and even more about controlling them using their natural enemies. An Agricultural Research Service (ARS) entomologist, Behle specializes in ways to formulate naturally occurring fungi and other microorganisms into bio-based pesticides. In fact, he and Purdue University colleague Doug Richmond recently finished a three-year project funded by the U.S Golf Association (USGA) to evaluate the potential of the fungus Metarhizium brunneum to kill white grubs, the larval stages of Japanese, June, and other scarab beetles. The practice, known as “biological control,” is one that’s already found its way onto some golf courses. Indeed, a survey by the Environmental Institute for Golf found that 42 percent of 27-plus-hole golf facilities sometimes or frequently use biocontrol in their pest management practices. The researchers used an ARS patent-pending process called “liquid culture fermentation” to mass-produce the fungus and turn it into clay granules, which they applied at different rates to grub-infested turf grass plots at Purdue University. When they rolled back patches of the turf, a grizzly sight awaited them. Depending on the rates applied, 50 to 70 percent of the grubs lay dead beneath the soil, covered in a fuzzy growth that confirmed the fungus had infected and killed them—typically 7 to 10 days after exposure. An insecticide applied to different plots worked even faster, killing 95 percent of the grubs. However, when used in the fall, the chemical had lost some of its “punch” against larger-sized grubs compared to the fungus, which worked better with the cooler temperatures.  The findings, which the researchers published in a USGA annual report, could help golf course superintendents identify ways to use the fungus as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach, which combines judicious insecticide use with cultural, biological and other controls. Golfers needn’t be distracted by the prospects of this biocontrol fungus quietly working underfoot, though. Its absolute preference for infecting white grubs and other insect turf eaters means people, pets and wildlife won’t suffer the same fuzzy fate as these pests.

"International Programs Office, USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service in  Trade  Oct 20,  In Nigeria, NASS representatives Matt Deaton, Terry Holland and John Campbell worked with Kaduna State Agricultural Development Programme, National Bureau of Statistics Federal Department of Agriculture to develop a stronger national agricultural statistics program. Today the United Nations is celebrating the first World Statistics Day, to raise awareness of official statistics, which are premised on the core value of service, professionalism and integrity. As one of the principal statistical agencies in the U.S., the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) has been heavily involved in establishing and improving agricultural statistics systems in countries around the world since the end of World War II. Food insecurity, shortfalls in regional food production and lack of reliable information on the agricultural sector are major concerns in many countries. Improved agricultural systems can provide more and better information to address these issues. This is why, over the past 10 years, NASS international projects have been instrumental in helping more than 30 developing and emerging market countries in Africa, Central and South America, Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe to develop and improve their agricultural statistics programs. Using our experience in conducting the census of agriculture, NASS is currently working with the Armenian National Statistics Service and the Ministry of Agriculture to conduct a full count of agriculture in Armenia. It has been 90 years since Armenia conducted its last census of agriculture. The upcoming census will also be Armenia’s first since the country gained its independence in . In addition to the Armenian census of agriculture, NASS is also currently working with the governments in Georgia, Brazil, Mongolia, Nigeria and Serbia. Our agency is also gearing up to start a new project in Moldova. We work to provide all of these countries with technical assistance and training on a reimbursable basis in all aspects of statistical surveys and systems. The benefits of such assistance extend beyond serving the interests of the various countries. By helping other countries improve their agricultural statistics systems, USDA’s ability to assess world food and fiber production is also improved. Establishing strong working relationships with other agricultural statisticians around the world allows NASS staff to gather and develop new ideas for improving the U.S. agricultural statistics system, while exposure to other cultures and work situations enhances our employees’ abilities to solve problems.

"USDA Office of Communications in  Food and Nutrition  Sep 09,  A new poll shows that parents of school-age children overwhelmingly support national nutrition standards for all foods and beverages sold to students during the school day. For more information, visit: www.pewtrusts.org/SchoolFoodParentPoll. Click to enlarge. Over the past four years, USDA has worked closely with schools, parents, community leaders, and nutrition experts to ensure that when children go off to school, they are greeted by a healthier school environment.  According to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years, leading to an increase in obesity-related health outcomes in children, including cardiovascular disease, pre-diabetes, and bone and joint problems.  Improving school nutrition is vital to reducing childhood obesity, because many children consume half of their daily calories during the school day. Making the healthy choice the easy choice sets our nation’s children up for a lifetime of healthy choices, and supports a healthier next generation.  Recently, we’ve seen evidence that student acceptance of healthier meals is increasing across all grade levels.  Today, we are pleased to see the results of the latest poll by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the American Heart Association, showing that most parents support the healthier meal and snack standards implemented through the Healthy, Hunger-free Kids Act of .  Read more about the results of that study in this guest blog, from the American Heart Association. A majority of parents favor strong national nutrition standards for food and drink sold at schools, according to a poll released Monday by The Pew Charitable Trusts, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the American Heart Association. In addition, the poll found that parents would also like to see salt limited in school foods and more fruits and vegetables served. The poll, which was conducted in June among 1,112 parents, said that 80 percent of the parents said they were concerned about their children’s health. Seventy-four percent said they were concerned about childhood obesity, a major risk factor for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar and cardiovascular disease later in life. Currently, more than one third of children and adolescents are clinically overweight or obese. Among children ages six to 11, obesity rates rose from 7 percent in to 18 percent in . The rates increased from 5 percent to 21 percent during that same period for youth ages 12 to 19. Childhood obesity has been a major national focus, with federal agencies and advocacy organizations, including the American Heart Association, working on ways to curb the trend. The poll was conducted just weeks before the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued “Smart Snacks” standards on July 1, which mandated that school snacks must be a fruit, a vegetable, protein, dairy, or whole grain; have fewer than 200 calories; and be low in fat, salt, and sugar. The poll revealed that support for stricter school nutrition standards cut across racial and political lines. Sixty-eight percent of whites, 85 percent of Hispanics and 91 percent of African-Americans said they support the standards. Fifty-six percent of Republicans, 71 percent of independents and 84 percent of Democrats favored stronger standards. Only 22 percent of parents expressed that they strongly opposed higher school nutrition standards. Among the poll’s other findings: 72 percent favor national standards for school meals; 72 percent support standards for school snacks; 91 percent support requiring schools to include a serving of fruits or vegetables with every meal; 75 percent think salt should be limited in meals; 23 percent believed food sold a la carte at schools was nutritious, whereas only 8 percent believed the same of food sold in vending machines. Penny Kris Etherton, PhD, a professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania, said the findings are encouraging, but parents voicing support is just the beginning. “Schools and parents need to be on the same page about what the kids eat,” she said. “You can’t have one set of standards at school and another set of standards at home. It’s encouraging to see that parents are supportive of higher nutritional standards, but we need to educate across the board so that parents understand what this really means for how their kids should eat.” Reducing sweetened beverages can lower a child’s intake of “empty” calories, Kris-Etherton explained. However, some parents might believe fruit juice is healthy “when it’s really just sugar water. The child would be better off either drinking plain water or eating a piece of fruit to get the fiber and nutrients from the fruit. The challenge will be making healthy eating fun and interesting for kids.” The poll was conducted by Hart Research Associates and Ferguson Research.  Pew, RWJF, and AHA are jointly supporting efforts to ensure all foods and beverages in schools are healthy. The Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project is a collaboration between Pew and RWJF. Voices for Healthy Kids is an initiative of RWJF and AHA, with Pew providing additional expertise.

"USDA Economic : Building Blocks for Policy  About midway through USDA’s 150-year history, federal officials decided that economic research and analysis could be a valuable, objective tool in helping farmers – and policymakers - grapple with farm price and income issues. In , the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) – predecessor agency of USDA’s Economic Research Service (ERS) – came into existence. The Bureau began regularly producing agricultural market outlook (still an ERS staple), and - not surprisingly - its early work included analysis of agricultural policy impacts during the Great Depression. Although the BAE’s functions were dispersed throughout the Department in the s, they were assembled again into a single agency, the Economic Research Service, in .  I’ll touch on just a few highlights of ERS activities that illustrate the value of our agency’s work over the past century.  Mary Bohman, Administrator, Economic Research Service  Posted in  USDA Results  Apr 12,   Respond to this story",What role has the USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) played in helping farmers and policymakers navigate agricultural policy issues over the past century?,"The USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS) has played a key role in providing objective economic research and analysis to help farmers and policymakers understand farm price and income issues, as well as analyze the impacts of agricultural policies."
"Public Affairs Specialist, Foreign Agricultural Service in  Food and Nutrition  Trade  Apr 07,  Clemence, a teacher from Ogondougou School, displays the peanuts grown in the school garden to be used as a condiment in the meal provided by USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes). A group of schoolchildren wait patiently in line to get their lunch. This ritual takes place in schools all over the world. But for the children in Mali, a country ranked 160 out of 169 of the poorest countries in the world, this may be their one nutritious meal for the day. With the number of chronically hungry people surpassing one billion, a sustainable approach is necessary to answer the call of those in need. USDA’s McGovern-Dole Food for Education Program answers that call and works to not only feed the world’s hungry, but also improve the nutrition and education of children around the world. At noon each day, the students line up and eagerly wait for their turn to get their plate full of rice and split peas thanks to USDA (CRS/Carmen Matty-Cervantes). The McGovern-Dole Program supports education, child development and food security in low-income, food-deficit countries that are committed to universal education. It provides for donations of U.S. agricultural products, as well as financial and technical assistance for school feeding and maternal and child nutrition projects. Currently, USDA funds 36 active agreements with 17 cooperating sponsors in 28 countries, assisting more than five million beneficiaries. To date, the Program has provided meals to more than 22 million children. Since , Catholic Relief Services, with the help of the McGovern-Dole program, has played a large role in improving the lives of children and their families in Mali, a country with a population of more than 12.5 million. The United Nations recently reported that 10 percent of the total population was undernourished and that 38 percent of pre-school aged children are physically stunted. In light of Mali’s situation, this McGovern-Dole project has enhanced the welfare of targeted communities through improving access to food and education for children. By the end of the fiscal year, the CRS/Mali program had directly impacted the lives of over 45,000 individuals in Mali. In promoting the health of students, teachers, and school cooks, more than 5 million meals, as well as vitamins and medications, were distributed among 120 schools. Nearly 2,000 members of school management committees supported by the program participated in literacy sessions and radio broadcasts about the importance of education. Through these efforts, overall school enrollment in targeted communities has increased from 26 percent to 32 percent for boys and from 39 percent to 55 percent for girls since the program began in . In May , the Obama administration unveiled the Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative. The Initiative supports the international effort to increase the availability and accessibility of food and to improve nutrition and food safety. It serves as a springboard for broader economic development and food security. It also serves as a foundation for peace and opportunity in developing countries, which ensures our own national security. USDA is working with the U.S. Agency for International Development, the U.S. Department of State, and international organizations to help implement the Initiative. The McGovern-Dole program is one way USDA leverages its resources to support Feed the Future. The Program has played a critical role in enhancing the livelihood of Malians and will remain a bright spot in food assistance and education in communities around the world.

"USDA Pennsylvania Public Information Officer in  Rural  Feb 14,   Snow didn't stop the ideas from flying as members of the Northern Tier Regional Planning and Development Commission (Northern Tier) and their partners from Bradford, Sullivan, Susquehanna, Tioga, and Wyoming Counties met in Pennsylvania last month. Northern Tier is leading the regional group that was awarded the opportunity to participate in the Stronger Economies Together (SET) training and technical assistance program, sponsored by USDA Rural Development in conjunction with the Northeast Regional Rural Development Center and Penn State Extension. The SET program is a nationwide effort focused on working with regional groups to encourage and strengthen regional thinking and developing information and strategies to address issues affecting the region. The training will cover nine course modules on “Strategies for Building New Economic Opportunities” which will be completed by next year. Marcellus Shale was the topic, but the conversation wasn't about the money and jobs the industry has brought to the area. The conversation was about how to measure the economic impact of Marcellus Shale, keep the dollars in the region, and create a sustainable economy. The Northern Tier realizes the way to achieve sustainable results and best utilize area resources is regional collaboration. The foundation created on that snowy morning will be the building blocks of the region's future success. This effort is a great example of how Rural Development has brought leaders and stakeholders in several communities together to collaborate on how to improve the quality of their community.

"AMS Livestock, Poultry, and Seed Program Deputy Administrator in  Conservation  Jan 27,  Livestock correlations, like the one held at Penn State, are one way that USDA Market News ensures the accuracy and consistency in its . The correlation allowed reporters to compare live animal assessments and grades with the post-slaughter assessment and grades of the same animals. During its 100 years of serving the livestock industry, USDA Market News – part of USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) – has prided itself in creating transparency and clarity in the marketplace by allowing all industry stakeholders to have the same information about the market at the same time.  The entire agricultural supply chain relies on USDA Market News for timely, unbiased .  Without this free service, information would not be available to everyone equally, making USDA Market News a vital lifeline for America’s agricultural economy. Over the years, countless changes have occurred in the livestock industry – like the way that livestock standards are applied and the way market reporting is conducted.  To keep up with these changes, livestock correlations are held to assure the industry that all USDA market reporters are applying the USDA’s livestock grades and standards consistently and accurately. AMS develops, maintains and interprets USDA’s livestock grades and standards – like the Prime, Choice or Select grades used for beef.  USDA grades and standards ensure uniformity in products and quality, as well as in USDA’s market published across the nation.  Grades and standards provide a common trade language that ranchers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers are familiar with and rely on to buy and sell effectively. Recently, a group of market reporters from the Livestock, Poultry, and Grain Market News division attended a livestock correlation at Penn State University facilitated by its on-campus meats laboratory.  At Penn State, market reporters evaluated a pen of cattle and a pen of lambs and assigned the appropriate livestock quality and yield grade, while veteran market reporters spoke about the animals’ distinguishing qualities.  The Penn State campus offered a unique venue for the correlation, having a full meat processing and cutting facility right on campus. The next day, the market reporters returned to Penn State to correlate their live animal grade designations from the previous day to the same animal’s post-slaughter grade designations, comparing and correlating their findings to check consistency and accuracy in their findings. Livestock correlations are just one way that USDA Market News upholds its commitment to accuracy and consistency in its .  Market reporters understand that in order for their to be as meaningful as possible, a Choice grade steer in Georgia needs to be comparable to a Choice grade steer in Iowa, just as a Prime lamb in Pennsylvania has to be equal to a Prime lamb in Colorado. This uniformity, strengthened by the continuous work of market reporters, makes USDA Market some of the most trusted and respected in the world.

"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way from the Summit: How REE is Using New Strategies to Reach Even Newer Poultry Handlers  During a walk along tree-shading sidewalks in the “burbs”; you’re accustomed to seeing games of hopscotch, bike rides, and maybe even the occasional Golden Retriever. However, one residential backyard, nearly 6 miles from downtown Atlanta, calls into question whether this is suburbia at all. There were swings, a tree house, and even patio furniture. Yet one feature certified this was not your mother’s suburban home: over a dozen chickens living comfortably in a custom made “Coop de Ville.”    The rise of “backyard poultry” is one of many agricultural phenomena tied to a growing food consciousness and increased urbanization. And while USDA’s fundamental job doesn’t change, the Department does because the challenges do.  The recent cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at increasingly popular backyard chicken coops underscore this. While this concern was not clearly expressed in the Act of Congress that created the Department, the mandate was. USDA still works to “acquire and to diffuse…information” towards facilitating the protected growth of American agriculture. That service is what brought Research, Education, and Economics Undersecretary Dr. Catherine Woteki to this residence in Decatur, GA. Accompanied by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service officials and a man known best as the “Chicken Whisperer,” Dr. Woteki toured the site and helped to shed light on current HPAI research and important biosafety measures.

"Administrator, USDA Rural Housing Service in  Rural  May 12,  New home loan processing is saving customer and staff time, taxpayer money and lots of paper. (Click to enlarge) This has been the year of innovation at USDA Rural Housing Service. We are working smarter, faster, more efficient and environmentally conscious than ever before.  After years of brainstorming, planning, reengineering, testing, and training, RHS has realized its vision: the Section 502 Guaranteed Single Family Home Loan Program now operates paperless, and we’re saving more than we ever imagined possible. USDA’s Rural Development State field offices now transact business with private lenders via Web-based uploads and electronic signatures.  This means RHS and our private partners are no longer printing and sending hundreds of pages of paper back-and-forth every time a loan guarantee is used to help a rural American family buy their home. As a result, loan guarantees are processed faster and families move into homes more quickly. Postage fees will be eliminated and huge print jobs avoided for every one of the 140,000+ home loans USDA guarantees we will make in the coming year. Initial estimates show USDA Rural Housing Service will save 37,500 reams of paper every year now that we do more business in a paperless environment. More than 135,333 staff hours per year nationwide were being spent managing these paper processes. Staff will have more time to assist our customers, connect with potential partners and, of course, help more rural Americans buy their own homes through our 502 homeownership programs. All of the savings in time, paper and postage adds up to some serious savings of American tax dollars. In fact, we estimate RHS will save more than $4.2 million in just one year of using the new process nationwide.  This means we can allocate more time and money into oversight initiatives that will work to ensure lender compliance, and more adequately staff other Single Family Housing Programs to better serve Rural America. The people who work in the Rural Housing Service are proud of this milestone! But, as they like to remind everyone, RHS is just getting started.  Innovation projects of this sort have begun to touch every one of the Agency’s programs. RHS is advocating for the American dream of homeownership by working smarter, faster, more efficiently, and more conscious of the environment than ever before.

"Special Projects Coordinator, Arizona USDA Rural Development in  Rural  Jan 23,   “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.” Those words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. seem particularly prophetic for staff at USDA Rural Development in Arizona. As staff was planning for the federal Martin Luther King Day of Service, we received news that our friend on the USDA Phoenix building cleaning crew, Elia Zepeda, was ill and in the hospital. Within days she slipped into a coma and died. Elia’s cheerful personality greeted many USDA Rural Development employees at the Arizona State Office as they entered or exited the building each day. Although we never saw her in anything but her blue Goodwill uniform, it was clear that, although she loved her job, she was much more than a “cleaning lady.” Co-workers at Goodwill and so many of the workers for the federal agencies at the building where she worked were stunned and saddened by her passing.

The very heart of Stewpot is the noon meal its staff and volunteers serve each day of the year. This meal serves as the center of each day as well as the heart of the Stewpot philosophy. Rich and poor, black and white … all God's children come together over a nourishing meal. More than 120 people a day are physically and spiritually fed in the community kitchen and 50 meals are delivered to shut-ins in the area. Volunteers are always needed to lend a hand in the Stewpot Community Kitchen. USDA Rural Development employees began volunteering at Stewpot Community Services during USDA’s Martin Luther King, Jr. National Day of Service. “After volunteering in , staff has continued to support the organization by volunteering throughout the year. USDA Rural Development works each day to help rural communities, so we want to support organizations that offer assistance in their communities and who strive to help those in need,” said State Director for USDA Rural Development Mississippi, Trina George. Anyone is welcome to eat the Stewpot noon meal. Over 60,000 meals are served each year, and more than 7,000 volunteers serve in the community kitchen each year. Volunteers work as a team to make the plates for the Meals on Wheels program as well as the plates for everyone in the dining room. Volunteers serve the plates and drinks to everyone who has come to Stewpot for the noon meal. Approximately 10 volunteers are needed each day of the week to keep this rewarding ministry going. Stewpot, which began as simple soup kitchen, has developed into an organization offering several different programs – from shelter, to clothing, to counseling, to children’s programs.

"USDA Rural Development Utilities Service Administrator in  Initiatives  Rural  Technology  May 27,  Anita J. (Janie) Dunning, Missouri State Director, and Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator (center), painting the Ralls County PWSD No. 1 water tower A three day visit to Missouri, the “Show Me State” allowed me to join Janie Dunning, Rural Development State Director, to see how rural areas benefiting from infrastructure investments made possible through USDA Rural Development programs and American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (Recovery Act) financing. My trip started on Wednesday, May 18, , with a visit to Socket Telecom, LLC in Columbia, MO.   We learned of their progress on a $23.7 million Rural Utilities Recovery Act investment for high speed fiber-to-the-home broadband access to 2,700 homes, 36 critical community institutions and 270 businesses in Callaway County.  That afternoon, as a member of President Obama’s White House Business Council on “Winning the Future,” I facilitated a roundtable discussion with 20 community and business leaders of Mexico, MO, hosted by Frank Cordie of Mid America Brick. When you think of “bricks and mortar” for cementing economic development, there is no better place than in America’s heartland at a brick plant.  I gathered feedback on ways we can help businesses expand, create jobs, and improve the economic base in their area.  The roundtable was followed by a very interesting tour of the brick plant to see how the $10 million from the agency’s Business and Industry guaranteed funds was being used to bring this regional business icon back to life. Jonathan Adelstein, RUS Administrator; Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives; Jay Nixon, Governor of Missouri; Dan Strode, President/CEO of Ralls County Electric Cooperative. The next day, I joined Missouri Governor Jay Nixon for a “light up” ceremony at Ralls County Electric Cooperative (RCEC). They were celebrating the construction and hooking up the first customers of $19.1 million project, funded by USDA under the Recovery Act, to serve 4,600 households, 300 business and 58 anchor institutions in northeast Missouri.  I found most interesting is that the RCEC is reinvesting 10 percent of their earnings from the broadband investment for economic development opportunities for individuals and businesses in their service area.  This ceremony was followed by a working lunch to discuss other broadband opportunities with Damon Porter, Governor Nixon’s point-man on broadband. My next stop was to Ralls County Ralls County Public Water Supply District No. 1 to visit the site of water improvements including a new 250,000 gallon water tower.  Janie and I grabbed paint brushes and assisted with painting the water tower support.  Yes, that was a first for me. That evening the Missouri state office staff hosted me in a discussion with Barry Hart, CEO of the Association of Electric Cooperatives and other electric cooperative leaders to talk about partnering strategies to assist rural Missourians. My third day, included a tour of USDA funded Water and Wastewater projects in Howard County.  First stop was to a state of the art, environmentally friendly lagoon at the City of Fayette.  I was very impressed with this new technology and treatment of waste water.  One of the stages in the water treatment includes a process in a lagoon covered with a heavy duty rubberized material. I made a closer inspection of the rubberized material and verified that it was strong enough for opportunity for me to “walk on (waste) water”!  This may be a first for an Administrator. Jonathan Adelstein, USDA Utilities Administrator, walking on (waste) water at the City of Fayette lagoon. The next stop was to see another investment to the City of Fayette for improvements to their water system including the construction of a new water tower.  The last stop was for a celebration of strategies supported by President Obama and Secretary Vilsack for regionalization.  The Howard County Regional Water Commission was established as a regional water waste supply and treatment system to serve three public water systems in the southern part of Howard County including: the City of Fayette, the City of New Franklin and Howard County PWSD No. 1. It was definitely a packed three days but gave me a great appreciation for the hard work that the Missouri Rural Development staff perform in administering programs and “yes” they did “Show Me” some wonderful examples of our programs benefiting rural Missourians!

"Students Turn Science Teachers for 4-H National Youth Science Day  I went back to school yesterday. And my teachers were fourth graders. Fourth grade students at Hearst Elementary School in Washington, DC taught me and 200 other students about climate change, water quality and carbon footprints through the 4-H National Science Experiment.  All across the country and world, hundreds of thousands of students were doing the same set of experiments today as part of 4-H National Youth Science Day.  We saw how carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere and what its effects can be.  Watching students make connections between their actions and the environment was really exciting for me, and with a sixth grader of my own, it was fun to experience science with these students and get a glimpse of how empowering science can be for these youngsters.

"AMS Fruit and Vegetable Program Deputy Administrator in  Food and Nutrition  Jul 03,  In addition to purchasing blueberries for federal food distribution programs, AMS supports the blueberry industry through grant programs like the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council. Blueberries are often highly sought after because of their long list of health benefits and their sweet taste. Whether purchased fresh, frozen, or pureed, the blueberry has long been a staple in the diets of many people. Every July, the entire nation celebrates Blueberry Month by coming up with creative recipes and other unique ways to get their fill. Here at USDA, every month is Blueberry Month. One of the ways that we show our appreciation for our nation’s blueberry producers and processors is by creating more opportunities for people to enjoy this delicious fruit. Indigenous to North America, the history of blueberries can be traced all the way back to Native Americans, who added them to soups, stews, and even meats. Highbush or cultivated blueberries are grown on large bushes that are planted in rows. These blueberries are often sent to the fresh market. Lowbush or wild blueberries produce smaller sized berries and are pruned every couple of years. The majority of lowbush blueberries are processed into items like jams, jellies and baked goods. My agency, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), does its part to help more people eat these little blue dynamos.® Through our Commodity Procurement Program, we purchase frozen cultivated and wild blueberries. The purchases send this highly nutritious food to school children, families, and communities through federal food distribution programs like the National School Lunch Program. In , we bought nearly $17.9 million or 11.3 million pounds of frozen wild blueberries. This provided a reliable outlet for producers in places like Maine where 98% of the nation’s wild blueberries are harvested. As a result of this purchase, states like Maine can continue to strengthen their rural economies. Our purchases are also making a big difference in states like New Jersey -- the birthplace of the cultivated blueberry. The state’s blueberry industry produced more than 51 million pounds that  yielded nearly $81 million in revenue in . This was by far the largest revenue generator in the Garden State’s fruit and vegetable sector that year. In , AMS helped continue this trend by buying $18.4 million or 15.4 million pounds of frozen cultivated blueberries from growers across the country. In addition to our purchases, AMS supports the blueberry industry by offering grants to help it remain competitive in the marketplace. Classified as specialty crops, blueberries are eligible for grants through our Specialty Crop Block Grant Program. This program offers funds to states to support research and marketing projects that do things such as increasing crop yields. So, thanks to Specialty Crop Block Grant funds, several state agriculture departments can conduct research to mitigate the damage to its blueberry crops created by the Brown Marmorated Stinkbug and other invasive pests. Whether it’s July or any other part of the year, AMS is committed to supporting our nation’s blueberry producers and processors. We recommend that you add some color to your plate with some blueberries. The U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council’s website has some great recipes to get you started.

"Recreation, Heritage and Volunteer Services, U.S. Forest Service in  Conservation  Forestry  Mar 18,  An owl seems to plead for help after getting stuck in a vault toilet. A movement to save birds from serious injury and death garnered a Wings Across the Americas Award for the Teton Raptor Center of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and employees from several national forests. (Photo courtesy Teton Raptor Center) Small owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards. They prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death. The resolution that could save thousands of birds resulted in an award from Wings Across the Americas, a program of the U.S. Forest Service and its partners to conserve birds, bats, butterflies and dragonflies across all landscapes and boundaries. The project received the Habitat Management and Partnership Award, shared with Forest Service employees and the Teton Raptor Center in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Many public agencies use vault toilets to manage sanitary waste on their lands, and the ventilation pipes seem to attract the birds. The small owls enter the hole at the top of the vent, fall down the vertical pipe and land in the waste holding reservoir. The small size and weight of the birds make it impossible for them to gain any lift to escape. In , the Teton Raptor Center heard about the problem and decided to do something. Roger Smith, founder of Teton Raptor Center, said a photo of an owl peering up from the reservoir made him realize the need for “…a real, tangible conservation project that people could understand and commit to – preventing bird mortality from a man-made problem by covering the hole with a screen.” As a non-profit organization with a mission focused on conservation, education and rehabilitation, the Teton Raptor Center resolved to launch a public awareness campaign:  the Port-O-Potty Owl Project. Of course, it quickly gained the nickname “Poo-Poo Project.” Unbeknownst to Smith was the collaboration between Gerardo Chavarria, a Forest Service regional engineer based in Denver, and Greg Hayward, an agency wildlife ecologist working in Alaska. Hayward sought out Chavarria because he wanted an engineering fix to prevent the bird deaths. “His concern was contagious and provided a challenge for me to investigate if there was a cost effective way to screen the toilet vent stacks without too much negative effect on air flow out of the stacks.” he said. Chavarria used his engineering skills to design a screen that would not adversely affect the functional design of a vault toilet. In fact, his work helped to advance the quick fixes the raptor center sought on vault toilets on three national forests in Wyoming. Chavarria’s advance research determined the types of screen that would work, which allowed the raptor center and the Forest Service to immediately cap the toilet vents. Because the need and resolution were already pre-determined, Forest Service employees Joe Harper of the Shoshone National Forest, Tammy Fletcher of the Caribou-Targhee National Forest and Bernadette Barthelenghi of the Bridger-Teton National Forest could more quickly answer the raptor center’s call. Harper brought the awareness of what happened to the birds to the forest, and all vault toilets are now screened and any new toilets and pipes also will be screened. Fletcher helped to secure grant funding to purchase screens for the Caribou-Targhee and all participating land agencies within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. And Barthelenghi made the work possible on her forest and worked to ensure the project and solution were shared with all agency offices. Joe Alexander, forest supervisor on the Shoshone, said they partnered with community organizations to help install the necessary screens.  Local chapters of the Audubon Society and Boy Scouts engaged on this real world problem and helped to make a difference. “The Shoshone National Forest prides itself on being the leader in conservation,” Alexander said. “After implementation of these new toilets it became apparent that some small efforts could go a long ways in protecting our avian resources. The Wings Across the Americas awards were presented March 12 during the 79th North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference. Other award winners are: The Barto Fen Restoration Project on the Mark Twain National Forest in Missouri received the first Dragonfly Conservation Award for one of the largest and most genetically diverse populations of this dragonfly. The Monitoring and Conservation of Black-Backed Woodpecker in Burned Forests project received the Research Management & Partnership award. Since , several organizations, including the Pacific Southwest Regional Office of the U.S. Forest Service and the Institute for Bird Populations, worked to better integrate the habitat needs of the bird into forest management plans. The Bat Cave Gating Project on the Mark Twain National Forest also received the Bat Conservation Award. The forest is home to a large gray bat maternity colony, and the project’s goal is to protect the bats by closing nearby trails and installing chute gauges and flyover gates at entrances of bat maternity caves. The Migratory Shorebird Project: Connecting Communities of the Americas through Research for Conservation received the International Cooperation Award. The project looks at two species, the Western Sandpiper and the Pacific population of the Dunlin, measures their response to management actions, studies what influence population changes and educates people on the importance of wetland resources all along the Pacific Coast of the Americas.

"Forest Health Protection, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  May 05,  Removing mud and seeds from your shoes can help prevent the spread of invasive plants and animals. (Photo by Kim Lanahan-Lahti, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Forestry) For years now, the U.S. Forest Service has been encouraging visitors to our nation’s forests and grasslands, to not only enjoy all there is out there, but to play safe and play clean. One example of this outreach effort is the PlayCleanGo: Stop Invasive Species In Your Tracks campaign. PlayCleanGo has 130 partners, all fostering active participation in actions designed to interrupt recreational pathways of spread for invasive species. By becoming a partner, you can spread the message to stop invasive species in your tracks. “PlayCleanGo is designed to give outdoor recreationists a clear call to action to be informed and attentive in helping stop the spread of invasive plants and insects and improving overall forest health,” said Monica Lear, U.S. Forest Service Forest Health Protection Director. “These pests can expand like a different kind of wildfire, from forest to forest by unsuspecting visitors just looking for some fun and adventure.” From camping to fishing to hiking, getting outside and into nature is one of the many activities that our forests support. Outdoor recreation provides physical challenges, contributes greatly to the physical and mental health of individuals, provides economic benefits to communities, and has become an essential part of American culture. PlayCleanGo is helping these recreationists preserve the land they already love and enjoy. Through positive messaging, the program provides simple steps people can take to avoid accidently spreading invasive species.  This advice includes letting visitors know to stay on designated trails, remove mud and seeds from shoes and gear, and burn only local or certified firewood. For example, garlic mustard, an aggressive plant invader of wooded areas throughout the Northeastern and Midwestern US, can form dense stands and displace native species by competing for available light, nutrients and water resources. Garlic mustard seeds stick together when damp and adhere readily to small soil clusters, making it easy for them to stick to muddy boots, pant cuffs, and animal fur. Through easy actions like inspecting hiking equipment, clothing, and pets before going out on a hiking trail and conducting the same inspection upon leaving the trail, the PlayCleanGo campaign is helping slow the spread of invasive species. PlayCleanGo was launched by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in partnership with the University of Minnesota Extension, Minnesota departments of Agriculture and Transportation, and Explore Minnesota. Creating a new and successful awareness campaign, like Smokey Bear and his fire prevention message, depends on broad, frequent exposure to the public. For this reason, PlayCleanGo invites public and private organizations to join the effort by becoming a partner.

"The Buried Forest of Alaska's Kruzof Island: a Window into the Past  Seldom does one find a way to directly date a prehistoric volcanic eruption, but 11-year-old Blake LaPerriere opened such a door for excited scientists in Southeast Alaska. Last September, Blake, his parents, and his younger brothers were exploring a beach on southwestern Kruzof Island, part of the Tongass National Forest landscape and just west of Sitka, Alaska, where they live. Blake investigated a deeply incised creek behind a pile of beach drift where he found a standing burnt tree embedded in a tall bank of pumice. He brought it to his family’s attention, asking “Do you think that’s from a volcanic eruption a long time ago?” Curious, Blake’s father Zach took photos and sent them my way.

"AMS Deputy Administrator, Livestock and Seed Program in  Food and Nutrition  Oct 28,  USDA is as American as baseball and apple pie. Almost anything and everything about U.S. food – and in some respects, baseball – is somehow connected to USDA. Curious? Read on to see how USDA ties in to the World Series. “The Ryan Express” Delivers the Goods Major League Baseball Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan pitched 27 years in the big leagues, tossing a league record seven no-hitters. In that span Ryan was comfortably pumping 100 mile-per-hour fastballs past hitters until he was 40 years old, registering 95 mph on the radar gun until retirement. Nicknamed “The Ryan Express” for his baseball exploits, he went on to become a successful business owner. Ryan knows a good deal when he sees one. In he became a principal owner, president and CEO of the Texas Rangers baseball club. The team has made it to the World Series the last two seasons: losing to the San Francisco Giants in and participating in the thrilling, nail-biting autumn classic of against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ryan also knows the value of the USDA shield. He’s the head of the Nolan Ryan Guaranteed Tender Beef Program, a marketing program verified by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). AMS relies on university-researched and industry-recognized standards to determine which marketing claims it chooses to verify. Companies like Ryan’s can approach AMS and request the agency verify marketing claims such as “guaranteed tender” to assure customers that the products listed on packaging are exactly what they claim.  This is an important service to consumers who desire a certain quality of beef and want third-party assurance that their beef purchases meet exacting requirements. _________________________________________________________________________________________ USDA Certified – St. Louis (Cardinals) Style If you bellied-up at a local sports bar and ordered a plate of St. Louis Style ribs while watching the World Series, thank a former USDA employee for naming the cut of pork. In the late s Steve Olson, an agricultural marketing specialist in the USDA Livestock and Seed Program’s Standardization Division, wrote meat standards for the Agricultural Marketing Service’s Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS). Last June Olson shared his story about naming the cut of meat with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He explained how some butchers fancied carving off the breast bone and brisket bones from pork spareribs. “We did a survey to find out if there was a consensus for what this was called,” Olson told the Post-Dispatch. A majority of the respondents called it a St. Louis cut. “The only reason I went ahead and put the term into the IMPS is because I happen to be an avid St. Louis Cardinals baseball team fan, and they had just defeated the San Francisco Giants in a playoff,” Olson said. For more specifications, you can view the latest IMPS report. On pages 11 and 32, Item No. 416A is listed as “Pork Spareribs, St. Louis Style.” St. Louis ribs, ready to eat.

"Office of Communication, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Oct 24,  Bat Week graphic. By the time October comes around, store shelves are stocked with Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations. Bats are often situated among this imagery, whether as silhouettes in the background or as blood-sucking monsters. But bats are none of these things. They are primarily nocturnal, they make their homes in dark places, but there’s nothing scary about them. That is why Bat Week, October 24-31, is a time to celebrate bats, what they contribute to our society, and to dispel the myths that cause so much misunderstanding of these gentle, intelligent creatures. There are more than 1,300 species of bats worldwide, and they are diverse. Some, like Kitti’s hog-nosed bat, also known as the bumble bee bat, can be as small as your thumbnail and survives on insects. Others like the flying fox eat fruit and have earned their name due to their impressive size. Bats like this Mexican free-tailed bat feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. Photo by MerlinTuttle.org. There are three species of vampire bat among those 1,300. However, they live in Mexico, Central and South America; feed primarily on large livestock; and take about an ounce of blood in a feeding. Forty-seven species of bat call the United States home. Bats provide valuable services to us. Most feed on insects and play an important role in pest control on agricultural crops. The various species of beetles, moths, and other insects that often plague crops represent a tasty meal to a hungry bat. In fact, it is estimated that if bats were lost in North America, savings of up to $3.7 billion dollars annually would be lost due to increased pesticide requirements in agriculture. In one case, a Georgia pecan farmer was able to abandon pesticide use altogether after he built bat houses housing several thousand Mexican free-tailed bats. The Forest Service is looking into the role that bats play in pest insect control on the forest as well. Many insects, like bark beetles and gypsy moths, can be devastating to forests, and as voracious insect eaters, bats have the potential to help cull their numbers. Recognizing the role they play, the Forest Service has long been a champion of bat conservation. Over the last decade, the fungal disease white-nose syndrome has killed more than six million bats. While Forest Service researchers seek a solution to white-nose syndrome, the agency’s land managers explore improved ways to manage bat habitat. Within the 193 million acres of forests and grasslands that the agency manages, there are more than 25,000 abandoned mines that present both opportunity and hazard. Recognizing the potential of abandoned mines as ideal roosting, hibernation, or maternity sites, the Forest Service has constructed “bat gates” that provide a grating to keep visitors from stumbling into a potential hazard while allowing bats to fly freely. You too can make a big difference by planting bat-friendly gardens, building bat houses, and helping dispel myths about bats. Little Brown bats found in Maine with white-nose syndrome.

"Rural  Jul 19,   Story and Photos by Phil Eggman, USDA Rural Development, Washington State Office Donating a little bit of time can go a long way to making a big difference for people. Just ask the employees of USDA Rural Development in Washington State who, on July 13, donated two hours of their time at the end of a hectic day to make food packages for the elderly, young mothers, infants and children at the Thurston County Food Bank located in downtown Olympia. According to Thurston County Food Bank Executive Director Robert Coit, it was opportune that the Rural Development team were packaging food for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP), which is a USDA program that provides nutritious food ""packages"" designed specifically for the nutritional  needs of low-income pregnant and breastfeeding women, infants, children up to age six and elderly people 60 and older. ""It's a great program and helps us with our mission to eliminate hunger in Thurston County,"" Coit said, adding that the food bank serves 10,000 families annually, including 37,000 individuals, half of which are children, around the communities of Lacy, Olympia  and Tumwater. ""This was a great opportunity for us to help out in our local community,"" said Mario Villanueva, Washington State Director, USDA Rural Development. ""Too many Americans live in food deserts and lack access to healthy food.  USDA is a key partner in providing access to healthy food by administering the nation's nutrition programs, funding projects that provide underserved areas with greater access to fresh produce"" ""It was great!,"" said Becki Southworth, Multi-Family Housing Loan Specialist. ""I really feel like we were able to help our local community by not only what we do every day through housing, business and community programs, but by taking it up a level and getting out in the community, we were able to help meet another need, provide food to those that need it most.  I am so glad I was able to go and I would love to do it again."" ""I had fun and it felt great to know that we helped 210 families in just an hour and a half of work of great teamwork,"" said Housing Specialist Leslie Schmidt. ""It just shows how much you can help the community with just a little bit of our time."" In addition to helping out at the local food bank (an exercise the agency plans to repeat on a regular basis), Rural Development is participating in a summer food drive as part of the 2nd Annual ""Feds, Farmers, and Friends Feed Families"" (F5) initiative.  The Washington State food drive kicked off July 6 in Olympia and other area offices and will run through July 31. The food drive makes a big difference. Last summer, federal employees around the country donated more than 1 million pounds of nonperishable goods and daily essentials for those in need. The new goal for across the Federal government is 1.2 million pounds of non-perishable items.

"Agricultural Research Service in  Research and Science  Oct 31,  A wasp works its way out of an aphid mummy after developing inside as larvae. (Photo courtesy of the ARS Electron and Confocal Microscopy Unit) At Halloween, people revel in ghosts, goblins, and things that go bump in the night. Not all are in books or movies, though. There are plenty of creepy critters doing downright scary things every day in your own backyard. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, since many of these “monsters” are actually good guys getting the bad guys out of town; it’s just not always pleasant to watch. Fire ants are common in subtropical Southeastern states and have shown up as far west as California. These stinging ants are not just painful pests; they’re also a bane to agriculture, feeding on young plants and seeds, causing an estimated crop loss of $750 million per year. There are many ways to control or eliminate fire ants, but nature provides one that is tailor made for the silver screen! Enter the phorid fly, a natural predator of the fire ant. The fly swoops in on its target and deposits an egg into the ant. After hatching inside the ant, the maggot works its way into the ant’s head, where it lives for a couple of weeks, feeding on bodily fluids. The maggot then releases chemicals that eat away at the ant’s body until its head falls off. The maggot then stays in the severed head and feeds on brains until it reaches maturity and breaks out through the ant’s mouth. Like zombies? You will, if you don’t like cockroaches. The jewel wasp injects a serum into its victim, which “zombifies” the roach into submitting to its will. The passive zombie roach allows the wasp to lead it by an antenna into a nest, which quickly becomes a nursery after the wasp lays its egg. As with the phorid fly larvae, it feeds off its host until it reaches maturity. Mummies also abound in gardens and fields, courtesy of a pair of wasps. These wasps (Aphidiinae braconid wasps – pictured – and Pteromalid chaclid wasps) also deposit an egg inside the body of their prey, this time an aphid. The wasp larvae grow inside the aphid, which soon becomes mummified in that it turns inflated, rigid, and off-color. After the larva becomes an adult wasp, it chews its way out, leaving the mummy husk behind. “Husks are fun to collect and are routinely encountered in gardens,” said Matt Buffington, a research scientist with the Agricultural Research Service’s Systematic Entomology Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. “In fact, if you have them, it’s a good sign your aphid problems are being somewhat controlled.” Aphids are a scourge to crops and horticulture, where they suck on sap, which causes yellowing, stunting, distortion of plant parts, leaf mold, and, in cotton, poor fiber quality. Aphids can also transmit plant viruses. Not to be outdone, some bees (Trigona hypogea) make an appearance as scavenger vampires. “Instead of providing their young with protein from pollen, vampire bees gather protein from carcasses on the forest floor,” Buffington said. “Further, they have unique jaws for tearing into dead animal flesh and cutting it into pieces for transport and digestion.” There are plenty of other examples of insects that exemplify Halloween, but one of the spookiest is actually a mammal – the humble bat. If you can get past the vampire nature of some bats, you’ll find that many species of bats are great friends of plants; they pollinate, spread seeds, and feed on pesky bugs. So, on All Hallows’ Eve, as you’re greeting young ghosts and goblins doing their rounds of trick-or-treating, don’t forget about those beneficial creepy critters in your own backyard.

Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. When people think about keeping our homeland safe, they don’t usually think about animal diseases that threaten our nation’s economy and food supply, but USDA scientists do. Years of dedicated research on foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is paying off. A team of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and their U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborators received the DHS Secretary's Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award at a recent ceremony in Washington, D.C. The award recognizes outstanding leadership or service distinguished by achievements of national or international significance that improves our homeland security. The team successfully developed and licensed the world’s first molecular FMD vaccine for cattle—the most significant scientific accomplishment in FMD vaccine development in the past ates. Research leading to this award was initiated by retired scientist Marvin Grubman while working at ARS’ Foreign Animal Disease Research Unit (FADRU) at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Orient Point, New York. Grubman created a novel FMD vaccine, which was used as the foundation for this work. ARS scientists receiving the award were Luis Rodriguez and Teresa de los Santos at FADRU, and Laszlo Zsak at ARS’ Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia. Other FMD team recipients were Lawrence Barrett, Jeffrey Babcock, Michelle Colby, John Neilan, Michael Santillo and Christopher Schutta, with DHS’ Science and Technology Directorate at Plum Island; and Lavanya Ratnam and Robert Webb, with the Office of General Counsel in Washington, D.C. FMD is a highly contagious disease that affects cattle, swine and other cloven-hoofed animals. Infection can lead to critical economic consequences with potential severe losses in producing and marketing meat and milk.  Although the United States has not had an FMD outbreak since , the disease is still considered a serious threat to our nation's economy and food supply. “This award is an achievement for all of us in ARS and emphasizes the importance of the work we do every day,” said Rodriguez, FADRU research leader. “Our FMD research is part of our mission, but also part of our homeland security. This was a joint interagency collaboration that turned valuable federal research into a vaccine and a product.” DHS Secretary's Exceptional Service Gold Medal Award presented to a team of USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists and their U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) collaborators.

"DVM, Ph.D., USDA/APHIS Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services, U.S. Chief Veterinary Officer in  Animals  Oct 16,  Waterfowl fly at 40 to 60 miles per hour. Migrating mallards can cover 800 miles in 8 hours if helped by 50 mile per hour tail winds. We know you’ve heard it before: seasonal migratory patterns bring an increased risk of disease-carrying birds interacting with commercial or backyard poultry. But the health and safety of our U.S. poultry flock is important enough to make it worth repeating. Birds, particularly waterfowl like ducks and geese, can carry avian influenza without showing any symptoms or signs of disease. Because the risk of introduction never goes away, having strong biosecurity practices on poultry operations can help prevent the spread of infectious disease before it starts. The - U.S. Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak is never far from my mind. It forced us to reevaluate our preparedness and response capabilities, from a federal, state, and industry standpoint. Today, we are all better prepared to handle and quickly respond to avian influenza detections. Our Wild Bird Surveillance Program, which has been in place for more than a decade, is on-going. Since July , USDA and our partners have collected more than 90,ates. This improves our ability to detect these viruses and helps poultry producers and others make informed management decisions. The program also gives us a chance to learn more about the virus, including the make-up and transmission of various virus strains. We’ve taken these experiences and lessons learned from the -15 outbreak and developed Defend the Flock, an outreach program that offers commercial poultry growers important information to help put the best biosecurity practices into place. Defend the Flock provides multiple resources for poultry growers, including guidance on biosecurity basics, an assessment tool to help strengthen their biosecurity programs, and sharable materials to help everyone at their operations better understand biosecurity’s importance. Stay up-to-date on the latest biosecurity information by following on Twitter. Everyone who has poultry in their care can help defend the U.S. poultry industry by reviewing the following biosecurity basics. Together, we have made great strides in our preparedness and response capabilities. Protecting American poultry remains a top USDA priority. Biosecurity can stop the disease before it stops.

"Public Information Coordinator, Mississippi Rural Development in  Rural  May 03,   U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack joined Obama Administration Cabinet members Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Shaun Donovan, as well as Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate, Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills, and other state and local officials to tour areas in Alabama and Mississippi affected by last week’s tornadoes. After visiting devastated sites in Birmingham and nearby areas, the group crossed over to Mississippi, where they surveyed the damage done to Smithville, a town of approximately that was almost literally wiped off the map. In Smithville, Miss. the senior administration officials were joined by Mississippi’s USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George, who had made the trek from her home in central Mississippi in the pre-dawn hours on Thursday, the day after the tornado hit. State Director George viewed damaged areas in Maben, Amory, and parts of Chickasaw County on Thursday. She had monitored the tornado, keeping in contact with local officials as the tornado went through Mississippi on Wednesday. She linked up on Thursday morning with local USDA personnel in Oktibbeha County, arriving only hours after the tornado had passed through. She also toured damaged areas in Neshoba and Kemper Counties that afternoon. Secretary Tom Vilsack toured the area of Smithville, Mississippi and saw firsthand the heavy damage caused by the tornado. He is seen in this photo talking to one of the victims of the disastrous weather. Behind him is USDA Rural Development State Director Trina George of Mississippi. Secretary Vilsack and State Director George were two of a number of Obama Administration Cabinet officials, federal administrators, and local leaders to see the damage caused by tornadoes in Mississippi and Alabama. “It is heartbreaking to see this damage and to talk to the people who are victims of the tornado,” said George. “I was able to not only see the physical damages, but I was able to listen to some of the actual victims, many of whom had lost everything. However, I can report that USDA Rural Development has programs that can offer some relief to these unfortunate victims.” George cited USDA Rural Development programs such as funding to replace and repair single-family homes, shared community facilities and the water and wastewater systems in the damaged areas. “I want to make sure that people know about the availability of our programs, especially our single-family home loan and home repair loan programs, so that they can rebuild their homes and businesses and continue to have clean water.” George has a history of fast action on disaster relief. Most recently, she was on the scene the day after tornadoes ran thru Holmes and Yazoo Counties in and made sure that USDA Rural Development programs were a part of both the immediate and long-term relief efforts in those counties. Local officials in both counties credited George and USDA Rural Development for their fast work in making resources available, especially to the homeowners who lost their homes in that disaster. “These people have lost everything but their spirit. For them to see the highest officials in our nation’s government, including Cabinet secretaries and head of relief agencies coming to what is left of their town to see the damage personally,” Said George, “I can’t convey to ya’ll how uplifting that is to those people.

"Posted by Almanza, Administrator of the Food Safety Inspection Service in  Health and Safety  Oct 22,  USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service Administrator Al Almanza (fourth from left) was among the senior executives from 10 federal agencies who took part in the Interagency Import Safety Conference at Dulles, Va., on October 21, .  Yesterday I visited with FSIS personnel and 9 other federal agencies in Dulles, Virginia to focus on a critical element of food safety: protecting the public from unsafe imports. The Interagency Import Safety Conference was organized by the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to bring agencies together, improve cooperation, and build collaboration.  Our mutual goal with these efforts is ensuring the continued health and safety of the American consumer. I want to express a thanks and gratitude to those working to reach this goal to prevent foodborne contamination and protect consumers. Today marks us as one step closer to achieving our goal by focusing on food import safety cooperation. I would also like to thank our import inspection personnel who are working hard every day on the frontlines at keeping harmful imports from reaching the American public. In December of last year, the Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center opened here in Washington, D.C. to provide agencies with shared resources, analysis and expertise necessary to improving the safety of imports. This, among other initiatives proposed by the Food Safety Working Group, will provide an appropriate forum to address the concerns expressed by consumers about the safety of the food they’re serving their families. I was able to see today the commitment of our public health officials and import inspectors through innovative ideas and combined resources. I look forward to continue working across agency borders to fulfill our commitment to protecting public health.

"Public Affairs Specialist, Food and Nutrition Service in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  May 25,  Map of the dollar value of USDA Foods purchased in ; represent the states that are the largest sources of a particular type of USDA Foods. (Click to view a larger version) Do you know where your food comes from?  If you can pinpoint where your food was grown and produced, you can make more informed decisions to maximize quality, freshness, and nutritional value.  You can also help support local economies through your purchases.  The USDA Foods program takes this mantra to heart and publishes state of origin with procurement information on all USDA Foods every year.  As we like to say at FNS, “All USDA Foods are local to someone.” USDA Foods are 100 percent American grown and produced.  Each year, USDA procures more than 200 types of food, including meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, flour, cereals, and dairy products, totaling approximately $2 billion.  Organizations such as food banks, disaster and emergency feeding organizations, Indian Tribal Organizations, schools, and other feeding groups receive these USDA Foods for use in meal service or distribution to households through programs like the National School Lunch Program, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations. A recent report on the state of origin of USDA Foods found that USDA Foods procures food from more than three-quarters of all states.  California, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Illinois are the five states with the highest dollar amounts of USDA Foods purchases.  A number of items available through USDA Foods are sourced solely from one state.  For example, 100 percent of the strawberries purchased by USDA Foods in FY came from the state of California.  During this time, California schools received approximately 3.3 million pounds of this locally produced product through the USDA Foods program.  All of the wild blueberries came from Maine and all the catfish were purchased from Mississippi. States and schools can use this sourcing information and other purchasing trends available on our website to tailor their USDA Foods purchases accordingly, or they can simply purchase with confidence, knowing that all USDA Foods purchases help strengthen the American economy by supporting a local community somewhere across the country.

"National Forests of Florida, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jun 08,   Well into the wee hours of night, for five successive evenings, teams of scientists from across the southeastern United States waited and watched as bats in the Apalachicola National Forest swooped down to feed on their insect prey only to be captured in sheer mist nets. The scientific teams and U.S. Forest Service wildlife biologists were conducting bat surveys to test for white-nose syndrome and general bat healthiness throughout the region. This Seminole Bat is a medium-sized bat caught by Gary Libby, an ecologist on the Bat Blitz Team that examined bats to determine levels of health and/or disease conditions, May 22, . The Seminole Bat grows up to four and one-half inches long with a wingspan of up to 12 inches and can weigh up to one-half ounce. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby. Dubbed “Bat Blitz,” the 5-day event was hosted by the Florida Bat Working Group, which partnered with the U.S. Forest Service, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the University of Florida “We’re mapping locations where each species was captured to learn more about the types of forest and water bodies that each species is associated with here in the Panhandle,” said Assistant Professor Holly Ober of the University of Florida Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. “We'll also study the bat guano to determine which insects each bat species is feeding on.” Bat testing to date has confirmed a very low probability of local bats being affected by white-nose syndrome, a condition linked to the deaths of more than a million hibernating bats from New Hampshire to Tennessee. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the cause of the bat deaths remains unknown despite the continuing search to find the source of this condition by numerous laboratories and state and federal biologists. Each night, 12 teams of five biologists spread out across the forest and surveyed bats in places where they were expected to be feeding. “Because bats are active at night, few people see them, and even fewer understand or appreciate their importance in our daily lives,” said Micah Thorning, wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service. “For example, as the primary consumers of flying insects, bats play a crucial role in insect control.” The survey netted 246 bats of eight different species with the number of bats caught at one site totaling 57. The most widespread species caught were the Seminole Bat, Evening Bat, Red Bat and Southeastern Bat, but rarer species such as the Tricolored Bat, Big Brown Bat, Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat, and Brazilian Free-tailed Bat were also captured and tested. The event started in with the Southeastern Bat Diversity Network (SBDN) selecting Tennessee to host the first Bat Blitz. SBDN promotes, facilitates and organizes the event every year. The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is one of two of its kind caught on found on the Apalachicola National Forest during Bat Blitz, May 22, . The Rafinesque's Big-eared Bat is listed as a sensitive species and is a rare find on the National Forests of Florida. Photo credit: U.S. Forest Service photo by Porter Libby. “Planning a Bat Blitz takes a lot of time and effort -- most states begin planning one and a half to two years in advance,” said Ober. “We began a bit late, so we have been working feverishly for the past eight months.” Ober credited their success to the dedication of a core group of individuals from the Florida Bat Working Group, an organization of local, state and federal agencies and private partners.

"Director, SNAP Benefit Redemption Division in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Mar 29,   Last summer, the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), in collaboration with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), released  the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook.  The handbook assists farmers’ market operators and direct marketing farmers in determining the steps necessary to become authorized to participate in SNAP and, subsequently, the steps related to managing participation. It includes tips and on how to make the program work successfully for vendors and customers.  The handbook also features a list of resources, a glossary of important terms, and several case studies from farmers markets that have successfully implemented EBT technology.  AMS’s USDA Farmers’ Market Directory is available online to locate farmers’ markets that accept nutrition assistance program benefits. Collaboration through the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative led the USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS),to co-release, with the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), ""Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at Farmers Markets: A How-To-Handbook."" There are many benefits to making farmers’ markets more accessible to all communities, especially those who are struggling to make ends meet in these hard times.  The concentration of fresh and nutritious foods found at farmers’ markets and sold by direct marketing farmers helps introduce low-income households to a variety of healthy options.  As SNAP clients increase their demand for local produce, small farmers have potential to increase in their customer base.  Our goal here at FNS is to authorize an additional 200 direct marketing farmers and/or farmers’ markets to accept SNAP benefits and increase redemptions nationally by at least $750,000 each year.  We are on our way to reaching these goals.  At the end of Federal Fiscal Year () , according to AMS, a total of 6,132 farmers’ markets were operating around the United States.  This represents a 16 percent rise from .  Of this total, 1,611 farmers’ markets and direct marketing farmers were authorized by FNS and redeemed $7,547,028 in SNAP benefits.  This is a 263 percent increase in the number of authorized farmers and farmers’ markets and a 49 percent increase in SNAP redemptions over the previous five fiscal years. Under regular SNAP rules, EBT equipment is provided free of charge and the expense is shared by the SNAP state agency and FNS.  For farmers’ markets and direct marketing farmers that do not have access to a land line and electricity necessary for the standard equipment to work,  the markets may elect to use manual paper vouchers or purchase wireless equipment through a third party processor.  FNS reimburses states that wish to provide wireless equipment to farmers and markets at the rate of 50 percent of the cost of equipment as part of the administrative cost associated with benefit issuance.  Under a demonstration waiver, FNS allows markets to implement scrip projects that allow a farmers’ market to obtain one FNS authorization to accept SNAP benefits for all eligible vendors at the market by using a single point-of-sale (POS) terminal.  The scrip (paper, tokens or receipts) is purchased at a centrally-located POS terminal that accepts SNAP benefits and is exchanged for eligible food products by participating vendors.  Many markets also use this process for accepting credit and debit cards. FNS has conducted a congressionally-mandated cost benefit analysis to assess the feasibility of equipping all farmers’ markets nationwide with wireless EBT point-of-sale (POS) equipment.  This analysis focuses on requiring centralized operation of a single EBT terminal to issue scrip, as it is the most cost effective way to equip farmers markets and often the most practical way for markets to manage participation.  It is likely that most farmers’ markets will implement SNAP if funding is made available.   President Obama has included a request for $4 million in the budget to support this effort.

"Posted by Written by Katie Yocum, USDA Rural Development in  Initiatives  USDA Results  Technology  Jun 11,  While the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma is rich in cultural pride, identity and history, its remote location in the rugged terrain of Southeast Oklahoma has severely limited the tribe’s economic development efforts.  But a Broadband Initiative Program grant, made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, will enable Pine Telephone Company (PTC) to use innovative wireless technology to deliver affordable broadband service to portions of this rural, remote and economically disadvantaged region in Southeast Oklahoma. During World War II, the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma provided an invaluable service to the United States by pioneering the use of Code Talking, using the native Choctaw language, to prevent enemy forces from intercepting the transmission of army secrets. And in , the Choctaw Nation was awarded the Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest recognition of support of employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.  So while the Choctaw Nation has shown outstanding compassion for the nation and its tribal members, the local economies of Choctaw communities have suffered tremendously.  Of the five counties on tribal lands that will be served by PTC, all of them are plagued with unemployment rates that soar above the state average and a substantial proportion of residents living below the poverty line. PTC spent years testing broadband technologies that would offer reliable internet service to residents of this remote region, and they determined that advanced 3G technology presents the most viable solution. The system is designed to be scalable and to cost-effectively accommodate technology upgrades, so that it will remain viable for years to come. PTC’s system will offer service to nearly 5,000 households, 10 school districts, and 12 volunteer fire departments and ambulance services. With reliable, high speed wireless access, the region will be able to overcome their geographic isolation to stimulate the sustainable economic growth that it needs.  And offering quality internet access to key community institutions, like schools and public safety bodies, will mean better educational opportunities and enhanced health care and public safety for residents of this region. And in addition to the many benefits to be reaped by members of the Choctaw Nation, this Recovery Act project will also create more than 150 jobs over the multi-year construction period.

"APHIS Pleased With Animal Evacuations At Two Flood-Ravaged North Dakota Zoos  In late May, two zoos in central North Dakota were hit hard by flooding.  The disaster prompted the need for a swift evacuation of the animals.  In Bismarck, the Missouri River threatened to submerge the Dakota Zoo and its 500+ animals under as much as seven feet of water, and in Minot the Roosevelt Park Zoo was a potential target of the rising Souris River, which runs directly through the city. During the height of the flooding, APHIS’ Animal Care Program monitored coming from the zoos and kept abreast of river levels.  Inspector Amy Jirsa-Smith contacted zoo officials regularly. She was on-site at both facilities, and helped corral some animals at the Dakota Zoo so they could be transported to other facilities.  However, she is quick to point out that the zoo staff at both facilities, with the assistance of several cooperating state and local agencies, state veterinarians, four neighboring zoos and the National Guard, had everything under control.

Photo courtesy Ron Ploof Sometimes it can take a while to turn a good idea into a successful venture.  At USDA, we understand the value of research, and by providing resources to get things started at the local level, we often see amazing results that have positive impact for farmers, agribusinesses and consumers across the country. The Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program (FSMIP), administered by USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service, is one of the many ways that USDA makes an investment in the future of agriculture.  Funding practical research projects that focus on innovation and collaboration, FSMIP’s diverse projects reflect the unique marketing challenges and opportunities faced by different agribusiness sectors, local communities and regions.  Sometimes, by solving a specific problem within their state or local area, grant recipients end up addressing issues that have national or industry-wide impact. With the support of FSMIP funds in and , the California Association of Food Banks (CAFB), in partnership with the California Department of Food and Agriculture, was able to dramatically expand its Farm to Family program.  Among several positive outcomes was a pilot project to help food banks access nutrient-dense row crops. Crops like broccoli, cauliflower, and celery are often sorted and separated right in the harvest field.  Products that do not meet supermarket grade are usually left in the field and tilled under.  CAFB worked with two major growers to harvest cull products, providing a steady source of high nutrient vegetables to food banks.  Since the project’s inception, people in need have enjoyed over 8 million pounds of these crops, and food banks now have a regular, permanent supply of nutrient-dense row crops.  This project provides a model for other states seeking to provide a new market for produce growers while meeting a vital food need. A young girl in front of food donations in Oakland, California.

Photo courtesy Alameda County Community Food Bank With FSMIP funding, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team led by Ohio State University used surveys and case studies to evaluate the current marketing strategies and practices of Ohio food producers.  The goal was to determine if and how a web-based marketing system called MarketMaker improved the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.  MarketMaker is currently one of the most extensive collections of searchable food industry related in the country and contains over 400,000 profiles of farmers and other food related enterprises in 19 states and the District of Columbia. This investment continues to benefit Ohio food producers in numerous ways.  The FSMIP study was the first step in developing standardized protocols to evaluate the contribution of marketing tools on reducing transaction costs and leveling the playing field for local food enterprises on a national level. As a result, the Ohio Direct Marketing Team attracted additional funding to develop training modules such as MarketReady to prepare producers to enter new markets.  They also held “Meet the Buyers” forums to bring buyers and sellers together for targeted sales meetings, and developed maps, apps & mobile media marketing tools to help consumers find producers. In , the number of registered producers and users of Ohio MarketMaker increased significantly.  There were more than 5,000 visitors and 679 registered producers by the end of the year.  In , Ohio was one of two states recognized with the first National Food MarketMaker Innovation Awards, sponsored by Farm Credit.  Building on strong food industry partnerships, the “Get Connected” campaign engaged new organizations through customized promotional and educational materials. As a result, the number of registered MarketMaker users nearly doubled from to . The creation of “Get Connected” artwork and marketing resources will benefit the entire national MarketMaker network of states. There are many other tales of innovative and collaborative FSMIP projects, and this year’s projects are no different.  More than half of the 22 projects focus on increasing sales of meat products, aquaculture products, and fresh and processed produce in local and regional food systems. Other research topics include forestry, bioenergy and horticulture. I’m sure that over the next few years—as these great ideas continue to build and have a positive impact on American agriculture—we’ll have even more success stories to share.

"Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative Coordinator, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Nov 03,  Lesser prairie-chickens benefit from lands where a rancher is using prescribed grazing, according to a new report. Photo courtesy of Nick Richter. Habitat conservation practices make a difference for lesser prairie-chickens. That's the finding of a recent scientific study – the first part of a multi-year study – described in a new report from the Lesser Prairie-Chicken Initiative (LPCI). LPCI, led by USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), works with partner organizations and ranchers to improve habitat and address threats to the bird. Since , more than 1 million acres of habitat have been restored on working lands. NRCS works with partners to monitor the outcomes, which helps determine if conservation practices are making a difference, but accurately estimating wildlife populations can be challenging with uncommon, widely dispersed species like the lesser prairie-chicken. A recent study identified a new model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, and it shows encouraging evidence that NRCS-recommended conservation practices through LPCI are working and that large blocks of intact prairie are important to prairie-chicken conservation. The study assessed one year of from the annual aerial survey of lesser prairie-chicken lek sites conducted by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, and it looked at four factors that might impact site occupancy — patch size of native vegetation, percent of land cover managed with prescribed grazing; percent of land cover enrolled in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and density of primary roads. The research team intends to continue with a multi-year study that assesses additional variables. As the amount of land enrolled in CRP or using prescribed grazing increases, the likelihood that lesser prairie-chickens will occupy that land also increases. Lesser prairie-chickens face many threats, including habitat loss and fragmentation from row-crop agriculture, fire suppression, unmanaged grazing, development, and drought. The species currently occupies just 16 percent of its historic range. But in western Kansas, lesser prairie-chickens have reoccupied portions of their historical range and have even moved into areas outside that historical range. The range expansion coincides with former croplands enrolled and maintained as grasslands through CRP as well as native grasslands managed using LPCI prescribed grazing practices. A team of researchers tested whether there was a quantifiable link between land where ranchers are implementing LPCI prescribed grazing plans or have enrolled their land in CRP and the likelihood of prairie-chickens occupying a landscape. Their results indicate that these habitat conservation efforts are working. After developing an expanded model for assessing lesser prairie-chicken populations, the team found that occupancy increases as prairie patch-size increases, as well as in landscapes with ongoing conservation practices. Specifically, the results indicate that when ranchers are using prescribed grazing or enrolling land in CRP, the likelihood of lesser prairie-chickens occupying that habitat increases significantly. The report’s management recommendations include: Enrolling acreage within the lesser prairie-chicken active range in prescribed grazing or CRP. Maintaining large blocks of native prairie across the range through sustainable ranching. Identifying potential landscapes with willing landowners to develop conservation easements, particularly if combined with prescribed grazing and other proven habitat conservation practices. Implementing prescribed grazing on dispersed patches throughout large blocks of rangeland. Cultivating diverse stands of CRP-enrolled grasslands that serve as connective tissue to larger patches of native prairie. Retaining CRP acreage as grasslands after contract expiration. NRCS outlined its three-year conservation strategy for lesser prairie-chicken conservation, which encourages adoption of many of the above recommendations on 500,000 additional acres, such as prescribed grazing, using easements to protect key habitat corridors, and providing assistance to convert expiring CRP lands to grazing.

"New Study Offers Sage Advice  For many, one of the New Year’s first big chores is to remove a tree from inside their home. Trees, beautiful and useful as they are, do not belong everywhere. Such is the case with trees and other woody species that are expanding into the Western grasslands. Over the years, woody species like juniper, pinyon pine, redcedar and mesquite have encroached on grassland and sagebrush ecosystems, altering these landscapes and making them unsuitable for native wildlife like the lesser prairie-chicken and greater sage-grouse. Encroaching conifers also degrade rangelands for agricultural producers whose livestock rely on nutritious forage.

"Chief, Natural Resources Conservation Service in  Conservation  Sep 22,  Utah rancher Bill Kennedy worked with NRCS through SGI to improve his working rangelands for sage grouse and livestock. Photo by Jesse Bussard. This past April, we woke up at 3 a.m. and made our way to a blind amid an expanse of sagebrush on a ranch in central Montana. When the sun rose that morning, I saw my first sage grouse--actually, I got to see more than 100 of them!--when the birds arrived at the lek site for their famous tail-shaking springtime courtship dance. Seeing sage grouse in action reminded me how important it is to do what we do here at USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). I saw firsthand how agriculture and wildlife can co-exist and thrive. In the West, we work with over 1,300 ranchers through the NRCS-led Sage Grouse Initiative (SGI) to improve their ranching operations while also helping this iconic bird. It’s been a big year for sage grouse. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) determined last year that the species didn’t merit protections under the Endangered Species Act because of the collaborative conservation efforts underway to help the species. Central to that effort were ranchers, who have stepped forward for many years to make a difference. But last year’s decision did not mean we slowed down our conservation work through SGI. We’re here for the long haul, building on previous successes by implementing our Sage Grouse Initiative 2.rategy, which will conserve an estimated 8 million acres of sagebrush—along with 350+ species that depend on it--by . Sage grouse are an “umbrella species” and an icon of the Western range. When ranchers implement conservation practices that benefit sage grouse, those practices also benefit 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman. With the help of conservation partners, NRCS has conserved 5 million acres of sagebrush rangeland and reduced threats to sage grouse. In the past six years, SGI and ranchers have: Reduced the threat of invasive grasses and wildfire by managing for healthier rangelands on 1.8 million acres. Removed 457,000 acres of expanding conifer to reclaim core sage grouse habitat. Protected 451,000 acres of agricultural land and prime wildlife habitat for 350-plus sagebrush-dependent species. Improved grazing strategies to enhance range habitat on more than 2.7 million acres for sage grouse and other wildlife species. Conserved 12,000 acres and improved 179 acres of wet meadow and riparian areas for brooding hens. Marked or moved 628 miles of high-risk fences to reduce sage grouse collisions by 83 percent. We continue to fine-tune our conservation efforts through science and research. In the past year, we’ve documented how removing encroaching juniper to restore sagebrush benefits songbirds as well as sage grouse. We’ve also studied how and where to reduce the risk of converting sagebrush into cultivated cropland, which we made available on the new SGI Interactive Web Application. This new online mapping tool provides free on rangewide conditions, helping NRCS conservationists and partners plan and prioritize conservation projects. Plus, we now use our successful efforts in sagebrush country as a model for the rest of the country. We are applying what we’ve learned to other priority species and landscapes to replicate success through Working Lands for Wildlife (WLFW). The future of wildlife, agriculture and rural ways of life depend on this shining model of collaborative conservation. SGI uses science, research and tools to improve and fine-tune conservation efforts. Photo by Tatiana Gettelman.  If there’s one thing we’ve learned, it's that, together, we can make a difference. We’re proud of our collective past achievements and look forward to continuing our work with America’s producers to conserve landscapes for future generations.

"Branch Chief, Farmers Market and Direct Market Research Branch, AMS in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Dec 17,  Shed Two at Detroit’s Eastern Market Look up Wayne County, Michigan, home to Detroit, in USDA’s Food Environment Atlas and it is obvious that local residents have some significant challenges in accessing healthful food.  An alarmingly high number of households that lack a car in Wayne County are located further than one mile from the closest grocery store, meaning that many families struggle to get access to fresh and healthy food.   Indeed, the closure of two supermarkets in left Detroit as the largest city in the country without a single full-service supermarket within its boundaries. A recent study indicates that over half a million of Detroit’s residents live in neighborhoods where they must travel twice as far to reach a grocery store than they do to reach a convenience store. As a result, many families are forced to buy their meals at these convenience stores, where microwavable pre-prepared meals and fast food are well-stocked, and fresh and healthy foods are often hard to find. Detroit, in other words, is a food desert. But, there is good news! Eastern Market Corporation, one of the nation’s longest operating public markets has taken on the challenge of addressing Detroit’s significant food access issues. Eastern Market has developed a comprehensive “food hub,”  coordinating aggregation and distribution for many of Michigan’s small and mid-size farmers who are producing the healthy food that Motor City residents need and want.  With nearly 500,000 of Wayne County’s 1.9 million residents relying on SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) for their food purchases, the market director knew that it was important to ensure that his organization could process SNAP benefits. Today, Eastern Market processes up to $30,000 of SNAP transactions per month.  What’s more, SNAP benefits redeemed at Eastern Market are doubled for each participating household with the support of the Fair Food Network, an organization that provides a financial match to SNAP redemptions through its Double Up Food Bucks program. As part of the USDA’s interest in examining  how actively coordinated food hubs can play an important role in eradicating food deserts, USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service has partnered with Eastern Market through a cooperative research agreement to expand the availability of fresh, healthful  and locally-produced food throughout Detroit.  Our to-do list includes: Developing more direct-to-consumer marketing activities in neighborhoods challenged by poor public transportation systems; Training farm vendors  about emerging opportunities for direct-to-consumer sales in food desert neighborhoods; Facilitating deliveries between the region’s local growers and organizations who are dedicated to distributing fresh, healthful food directly to Detroit’s neighborhoods in need; and, Educating local residents about available nutrition assistance programs and emerging market outlets. As a food hub, Eastern Market is uniquely positioned to serve all people in Detroit while economic benefits to local farmers, ranchers, and dairies.  Eastern Market and its member tenants provide a bevy of wholesale services that open new markets for the region’s small and midsize producers—including aggregation, distribution, processing and commercial market opportunities.  Eastern Market also houses prepared food businesses (like ravioli and fresh salsa).  They’re even planning to redevelop a full square mile in a dedicated economic development district to bring in additional business incubators, restaurants, retailers, wholesale services and a distribution center – all designed to help rebuild southeast Michigan’s regional food system and eliminate Detroit’s food access problems. By integrating all of these diverse business functions into one centralized, coordinated regional “food hub,” Eastern Market’s business development model can be expected to bring good things to Detroit.

"Celebrating American Agriculture: All USDA Foods are Local to Someone  March is National Nutrition Month. Throughout the month, USDA will be highlighting results of our efforts to improve access to safe, healthy food for all Americans and supporting the health of our next generation.  Fish and fowl, sowing and reaping, nutrition and agriculture… certain words and concepts naturally go hand in hand, and March is a month to celebrate both the foundation and purpose of the American food system. With March designated as National Nutrition Month and March 15 as National Agriculture Day, the time is ripe to reflect on healthy eating goals and to express gratitude for the farmers, fishers, and ranchers who provide the foods to fuel our nation. USDA’s Food Distribution Programs work at the intersection of nutrition and agriculture. Each year, USDA purchases more than 2 billion pounds of food worth nearly $2 billion from American farmers and distributes the food to schools, food banks, Indian Tribal Organizations, disaster feeding organizations, and other charitable institutions and feeding organizations. The programs benefit both ends of the food chain by supporting local agriculture and the economy while also providing a nutrition safety net for vulnerable Americans.

"Got Weeds? Need to hold water in the soil? Mulch can help with these things and more. Mulching is one of the simplest and most beneficial practices you can use in the garden. Mulch is simply a protective layer of a material that is spread on top of the soil. Mulches can either be organic -- such as grass clippings, straw, bark chips, and similar materials -- or inorganic -- such as stones, brick chips, and plastic. Both organic and inorganic mulches have numerous benefits. Mulch helps conserve and extend available water, protects the soil from erosion, reduces competition by suppressing weeds, moderates temperature extremes, and acts as a barrier or visible marker of gardening beds to limit damage by landscape maintenance equipment. Understanding when, what type and how much mulch to spread is important because spreading too much mulch can be damaging to trees and plants.

"What is a native plant? A native plant is a plant that is a part of the balance of nature that has developed over hundreds or thousands of years in a particular region or ecosystem. Note: The word native should always be used with a geographic qualifier (that is, native to New England [for example]). Only plants found in this country before European settlement are considered to be native to the United States. There are many benefits of landscaping and gardening with native plants including conserving water, protecting soil from erosion, and creating habitat and providing food for many different animals including birds, pollinators, and small mammals. Simply by growing native plants gardeners can bring enormous beauty to a community and joy to its residents. In addition, native plants are easy-to-grow and require minimal maintenance. Fall is widely considered the best time of year to plant native trees, shrubs, grasses, vines and perennials.

"In the United States, between 30-40 percent of food is wasted. This means that food that could have helped feed families in need is sent to landfills. Urban gardens can play a role in creating rich compost and improved soil quality from food waste. The best thing, however, is to reduce the food you waste in the first place. Learn how USDA is fighting food waste and how you can too. Food Donation All food grown in a People’s Garden at a USDA-owned, or leased, facility is donated to local food pantries, food banks, food rescue programs, kitchens, and shelters. Those growing food at other locations are encouraged to donate a portion of what’s grown to help those in need and reduce food waste. If you grow more than you need, donate it, don’t waste it! Helpful Tip Donations of food and grocery items to non-profits to feed needy individuals are covered by the Good Samaritan Food Donation Act (Public Law 104-210). Unless there is gross negligence or misconduct on behalf of the donor, individuals and groups are not liable.

"What is composting? Composting is the process of recycling organic materials into an amendment that can be used to enrich soil and plants. Types of Compost Bins Typical Compost Bin Tumbler Compost Bin Worm Compost Bin Why Compost? Food scraps and yard waste currently make up 20 to 30 percent of what we throw away. USDA is fighting food waste and you can too. Composting is nature’s way of recycling! Here are a few reasons to get started today:  Feed the soil without using chemical fertilizers.  Keep food waste out of the landfills and prevent greenhouse gas emissions.  Conserve water by building healthy soils. Get Started There are different ways to get started composting today. You can start a backyard composting bin or use worms to do the work. Backyard composting in three easy steps:  Choose a location. A good site is dry in either the sun or partial shade.  Set-up your compost bin. Purchase a compost bin or create an inexpensive bin with wire mesh and 3-4 poles for support.  Get composting. Include 2-3 parts “brown material” (fall leaves, twigs, shredded newspaper, straw, wood chips, and shredded wood) and 1 part “green material” (vegetable and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, crushed eggshells, garden and grass clippings, tea bags without staples) by volume then add water to keep moist. Don’t forget to turn your pile! A monthly rotation is a good rule of thumb. Worm Composting Setup:  Select Container. Purchase a worm bin or make your own from a plastic or wood storage container. Worm bins require holes drilled for aeration and drainage. There are several online sources with instructions to create a worm bin.  Locate bin. The ideal temperature for worm composting is 59-77 degrees F. The bin can be kept indoors or outdoors in the shade. During colder months, insulate the worm bin with blankets, straw, or other material to keep it warm.  Worm Bin Setup:  Worms need bedding such as a mixture of non-glossy paper, cardboard, or leaves. Soak the material for 10 minutes, wring out the water so it is moist but not saturated, and place it in the bin with a handful of soil.  Now you are ready to add your worms. There are over 9,000 species of earthworms, but only 7 are suitable for vermicomposting. The most widely used species is the “red wiggler” which you can buy from a worm grower. Do not use worms from a bait shop or your garden since they will not be able to thrive in your worm bin.  Feed your worms veggie and fruit scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, and moistened bread. Avoid meat, fish, dairy products, citrus fruits, twigs and branches.

Considering these differences, both methods are suitable for reducing food waste. However, vermicomposting is more ideal for homeowners who: * Have limited outdoor space * Want to reduce odors and pests associated with traditional composting * Can maintain a consistent temperature in their worm bin * Are willing to invest time and effort in managing the worms and their diet For homeowners looking to reduce food waste, either method can be effective. However, if you're short on outdoor space or prefer a more hands-off approach, vermicomposting might be the better choice."
"Southwest Regional Assistant WIC Director in  Food and Nutrition  Farming  Sep 21,  Claudia Crow, a farmer from Shawnee, OK, assists a customer during the Pottowatomie County Famers Market Five-Year Anniversary.  In the hustle and bustle of working for the WIC program in the Southwest Region, I travel quite often, attending meetings and ensuring logistics much like many of my fellow federal and state co-workers. Recently I had the privilege to attend the Pottawatomie County Farmers Market five-year anniversary in Shawnee, OK. Having grown up in a very rural town, representing FNS was a learning experience that reminded me of home. The event was a total success, as the market was full of people including farmers, seniors, families and children. Celebrating five years of service, the event included live music, family and children’s activities, and most important of all: fresh fruit and vegetables. I learned that famers drive hours to sell their crops at the market, and it accounts for as much as over two-thirds of their income. Most farmers market customers swear by the produce bought there, as it is much fresher and lasts longer than normal store-bought produce. In some cases, supermarket produce makes a week-long journey of over 1,500 miles before getting into the kitchen. But the most important part was seeing FNS programs like WIC and SNAP EBT represented. All of the farmers were knowledgeable about Farm to School and Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, and have even started farm tours for children and have working relationships with local schools. Getting fresh vegetables in school cafeterias straight from the farm is great on so many levels! Observing our partnerships at the grassroots stage from farmer to a customer, or farmer to a school sets a tone for the whole region. The relationships I see built are ones that last for years, and I wish the Farmers Market all the best in their future endeavors. Here’s to another five years of successful farming and selling!

"Cover Crops Cover crops are traditionally planted on farms but can be used in gardens. A cover crop is any crop grown to cover the soil and may be incorporated into the soil later for enrichment. Planting cover crops in your garden provides multiple benefits such as controlling erosion, suppressing weeds, reducing soil compaction, increasing moisture and nutrient content of soil, improving yield potential, attracting pollinators, and providing habitat for beneficial insects and wildlife as well as food to animals. Cover crops (grasses, legumes and forbs) recommended for seasonal cover and other conservation purposes include annual ryegrass, oilseed radish, winter cereal rye, and oats used for scavenging unused fertilizer and releasing nutrients back into the soil for the next crop to use. Good cover crops to break up compacted soils are forage radish (also known as oilseed radish) and forage turnip. Similar to commercial nitrogen (N) fertilizers, legume cover crops like crimson clover, hairy vetch and Austrian winter pea can help “grow” some of your N needs. Crop Rotation It has long been a common practice for farmers to vary the crops grown in each field from year to year. This same practice of rotating crops can be applied to small-scale food gardens. Make a plan to grow certain plant families in one area of the garden this season and in a different area next season. For crop rotation to be most effective, don’t plant an area with vegetables from the same plant family more than once every three to four years. Rotating crops can have important production benefits such as increasing yields, improving nutrients and organic matter in the soil, and it can help disrupt the lifecycle of crop pests, reducing chemical use. Don’t forget to add a cover crop to your rotation –especially when the garden is fallow –to reduce soil erosion and improve wildlife habitat.

"Posted by the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library in  Health and Safety  USDA Results  Jul 29,  USDA’s National Agricultural Library launches its latest Web exhibit “How Did We Can?” on home canning in the United States. July is the height of summer grilling season, and throughout the month USDA is highlighting changes made to the U.S. food safety system over the course of this Administration. For an interactive look at USDA’s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence. The USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) recently launched its newest online exhibit, “How Did We Can? —The Evolution of Home Canning Practices.” The exhibit follows the evolution of home canning in the United States and the progression of associated food safety . Canning aids in food preservation by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination. Home canning held an important role in 20th century food preservation, particularly through the two World Wars, and continues to be practiced today. “How Did We Can?” highlights changes in home canning based on a growing understanding of bacteriology. Around the turn of the 20th century, the four most prominent canning techniques were oven, open-kettle, water bath, and pressure canning. By the end of World War II, the USDA recommended only two techniques: water bath for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods. Those recommendations remain the same under the current USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning. During World War I and World War II, canning was touted as being imperative to the war effort on the home front and was referred to as “a real war job” in a Office of War Information poster. Home canning peaked during World War II when over four billion cans were processed in . While home canning has never since reached such a height, it continues to thrive today among home food preservation enthusiasts.

"High-Tech Agriculture Continues to Reap Rewards for Farmers and Society  This post is part of the Science Tuesday feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA’s rich science and research portfolio. Just like a smart phone helps users learn, communicate and make important decisions, smart technology—known as precision agriculture—helps farmers know and apply critical information about the right investments in fertilizer, seed, pesticide and water needed to produce their crops. Through new technologies, farmers produce more efficiently and see an increase in profits while improving stewardship of ecosystems and local communities. To talk about precision agriculture is to talk about mapping the amount of a crop grown per acre (yield) or the types of soils in a given area. It also includes the technology that automatically guides farm machines and controls variables like the rates of seeds, fertilizers or chemicals.

"Posted by the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library in  Initiatives  Health and Safety  Nov 21,  USDA Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) microbiologist Monifa Peterson demonstrates the addition of reagents for an E. coli non-O157:H7 analysis. Food is necessary and can be quite enjoyable, but it must also be safe to eat. Unfortunately, about one out of six Americans gets sick from eating contaminated food at some point during the year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Scientists from USDA’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) work for one of the federal agencies that conducts research to help make the foods we eat safer. To help the public more easily access USDA food safety research information, the department’s National Agricultural Library’s Food Safety Research Information Office (FSRIO) has launched a new “Meet the Experts” online video collection available on the NAL website. FSRIO has collected videos from a variety of sources and organized them in one repository. Current videos highlight ARS food safety research. FSRIO will add other videos to the collection that highlights research and food safety efforts from across USDA agencies. Many foods must travel through different points between the farm and your plate.  Lettuce, for example, is harvested from the field, cooled, processed and packaged, then transported to your grocery store where it is displayed in a cooler waiting for someone to buy it, transport it home or to a restaurant where it finally gets prepared and eaten.  ARS scientists in the produce-safety videos discuss how their research is improving the safety of that lettuce all through its journey to the grocery display cooler.

"US Forest Service Mobilizes to Save Cavity Birds  Small owls, such as western screech and northern saw whet owls, weigh between 3 and 7 ounces, or about the same weight as a small cell phone or a deck of cards. They prefer dark, narrow spaces for nesting and roosting, which is why they are called cavity birds. Their habitat preferences make them prone to using man-made features, such as open pipes, that mimic their natural nesting and roosting cavities. But on some public lands, that natural act of finding habitat in ventilation pipes has led to their death.

"A U.S. Forest Service Ranger Sees Wilderness as the Ultimate Yardstick  For most of his 16 years with the U.S. Forest Service, Dave Warnack spent them boots-on-the-ground. That’s to say that he does not just talk the talk. “Wilderness will be the ultimate index by which I measure my status, progress and overall place in the world,” Warnack says in the film “Wilderness: The Ultimate Yardstick. “I say this because when you enter a wilderness alone, unsupported, you quickly realize that the wilderness doesn’t care about you. It doesn’t care about the grades you got in school. It doesn’t care about your medals, your degrees or the size of your salary.

"AMS Administrator in  Research and Science  May 16,  Pictured here with his pet rooster, March, Lue Gim Gong’s work with citrus trees helped develop a frost-tolerant orange after a disastrous winter in Florida. No one should live in this world for himself alone, but to do good for those who come after him. These are the words that Lue Gim Gong lived by.  When he was only 12 years old, Lue left his home and farmer parents in Canton, China and crossed the Pacific Ocean to America.  He lived and worked in San Francisco until he was 16, and then moved to Massachusetts to take a job at the C.T. Sampson shoe factory. At church, Lue met Fannie Burlingame, the daughter of a wealthy farmer and merchant.  She immediately recognized his desire to learn and his natural talent with plants.   He eventually came to live with her family and they helped him become an American citizen in . Along with his green thumb, Lue had a knack for storytelling and a way with animals.  While his personality and desire to learn were larger than life, his body was frail and at some point in his youth he became very ill, possibly with tuberculosis.  His condition was made worse by the cold New England climate, so Fannie suggested he move to DeLand, Florida, where she and her sister owned a house and orchard. Working with William Dumville, Fannie’s brother-in-law, Lue planted orange trees and other fruits, immersing himself in the world of horticulture. In the winter of -95, Florida saw some of the worst freezes in recorded history.  Almost all of the citrus groves were lost—including the ones worked by Lue and Dumville.  Lue’s experiments in cross-pollination became focused on producing fruits that were more tolerant of cold weather. Fannie passed away in , leaving Lue the house and property in DeLand.  Devastated by the loss of “Mother Fannie,” Lue became a bit of an eccentric fixture in the small Florida community.  His pet rooster, March, and two horses named Baby and Fannie were his main companions, but his work with plant varieties continued. In , he was recognized for successfully cross-pollinated a “Hart’s Late” Valencia orange with a “Mediterranean Sweet” to produce a new orange named the “Lue Gim Gong.”  This sweet new variation, later found to be a nucellar seedling of the Valencia, ripened in the early fall and was much more resistant to the cold.  It is sold under the Valencia name today. His achievement won the Silver Wilder Medal, awarded by the American Pomological Society—the first such award for a citrus fruit. Lue also developed an apple that ripened a month earlier than other varieties, tomatoes that grew in clusters, and a peach that would ripen in late November.  His continued efforts with citrus plants also produced varieties of grapefruits that grew singularly (instead of in clumps), a cold-tolerant grapefruit that was slower to drop and a “perfumed” variety that had a heavy fragrance. Lue’s conviction to do lasting good changed the Florida citrus industry and broadened the seasonal range for many orchard-grown trees.  While his life was lived simply and mostly outside of the limelight, he certainly did his best to create something good for the generations of farmers that came after him. USDA’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), celebrates the life of Lue Gim Gong and spirit of the words he lived by.  From our programs that support farmers and ranchers of all sizes to our role in bringing food to U.S. troops, we strive to do good for those around us and those who will come after us.

"Be Fire Wise: Preparing Your Home for Wildfire Season  Very often, the difference between saving your home in a wild fire and losing it to the flames is pretty much determined by what you do to prepare your property. The U.S. Forest Service calls it being Fire Wise. I’ve had personal experience in the importance of clearing a wide perimeter around your property to deny fuel—dried wood, grass and trees—to a fire. Back about ten years ago my grandparents’ ranch house near the Cleveland National Forest in San Diego County was spared because of a 150-foot clear space between the flames and the house. And this wasn’t the first time that had happened.

For an interactive look at USDA’s work to ensure your food is safe, visit the USDA Results project on Medium.com and read Chapter Seven: Safer Food and Greater Consumer Confidence. The USDA’s National Agricultural Library (NAL) recently launched its newest online exhibit, “How Did We Can? —The Evolution of Home Canning Practices.” The exhibit follows the evolution of home canning in the United States and the progression of associated food safety . Canning aids in food preservation by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination. Home canning held an important role in 20th century food preservation, particularly through the two World Wars, and continues to be practiced today. “How Did We Can?” highlights changes in home canning based on a growing understanding of bacteriology. Around the turn of the 20th century, the four most prominent canning techniques were oven, open-kettle, water bath, and pressure canning. By the end of World War II, the USDA recommended only two techniques: water bath for high-acid foods and pressure canning for low-acid foods. Those recommendations remain the same under the current USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning.  the Food Safety Research Information Office, National Agricultural Library  Posted in  Health and Safety  USDA Results  Jul 29,   1 Response","What is the primary method through which canning aids in food preservation, as described in the ""How Did We Can?"" online exhibit?",The primary method through which canning aids in food preservation is by removing microorganisms responsible for decay through heating and creating a seal to prevent recontamination.

"Public Affairs Specialist, APHIS in  Animals  Plants  Apr 16,  Delicious citrus: Scott Bauer, USDA Agricultural Research Service It’s time to grab those gloves and get outside for some gardening!  April is not only a great time to plant citrus trees, but it’s also Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Before wielding that shovel, take a few minutes to learn how to keep your trees healthy and prevent the spread of citrus disease. Citrus greening disease, also known as Huanglongbing (HLB), is one of the most severe plant diseases in the world. The disease has devastated millions of citrus trees in the United States and now has the potential to eliminate the citrus industry.  Once a tree is infected with the disease, there is no known cure. Citrus greening is spread by a bug the size of the head of a pin—the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP). When the bug feeds on an infected tree, it becomes a carrier, spreading the disease from one tree to another.  Although the disease is not harmful to humans, fruit from infected trees are not suitable for consumption because of their green color, misshapen appearance and bitter taste. Here are four tips to help get you started with citrus while preventing the spread of citrus greening disease: 1. Be Aware of Quarantines. If you are thinking about buying a citrus plant, be sure not to move it from quarantined states or territories. Not only are you risking spreading citrus diseases by transporting citrus outside of these areas, but it's also against the law. Review the quarantine map at SaveOurCitrus.org. 2. Check the Citrus Plant Supplier. Be a savvy buyer. Citrus plants sold in a regulated state must be sold from a certified vendor and be properly labeled.  3. Keep Homegrown Citrus at Home. Help reduce the spread of citrus diseases by not moving your homegrown citrus fruit or plants from quarantine areas. 4. Inspect Citrus Plants Regularly for Diseases and Insects. Visit our symptom checklist and corresponding photos to identify a plant impacted by ACP, citrus greening, citrus canker, citrus black spot and sweet orange scab. If you detect an infected plant, report it immediately. If you suspect your citrus may be diseased, report it immediately to the USDA.  The USDA’s Save Our Citrus iPhone App offers a convenient way for people to identify and report suspected citrus disease. This free app is available for download from the iTunes store.   To learn more about the Save Our Citrus program, visit www.saveourcitrus.org or follow the program on Facebook and Twitter. USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has declared April as Invasive Plant Pest and Disease Awareness Month. Throughout the month, APHIS is posting a series of blog entries here and also share invasive plant pest and disease information through our twitter feed. APHIS and its federal and state partners are fighting to protect our communities, our public lands, and our agricultural resources from invasive species. But we can’t do it alone.

"Shoshone National Forest, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Nov 19,  Prince Albert II of Monaco poses in between Wapiti District Ranger Sue Stresser and Shoshone Forest Supervisor Joe Alexander. (U.S. Forest Service/ Kristie Salzmann) On a beautiful fall day on America’s first national forest, Prince Albert II of Monaco retraced the steps his great-grandfather took 100 years ago through the wilderness of the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming. Prince Albert II helped celebrate on Sept. 20 the centennial anniversary of the hunting trip his great-grandfather, Prince Albert I, took with now-historic figures William “Buffalo Bill” Cody and Abraham Archibald Anderson, the first Special Superintendent of Forest Reserves. The successful hunting trip cemented lasting relationships between the men and established an area in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, which is still known today as Camp Monaco. The centennial celebration began with a morning horseback trail ride following a route very similar to one Prince Albert I took a century ago. A local outfitter and fly-fishing guide, Lee Livingston Outfitting Inc., guided Prince Albert II and his party through the changing leaves of the forest where they were greeted with splendid mountain views and a few grizzly bear sightings. The trail ride was followed by a luncheon at the Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill Cody’s original hunting lodge on the Shoshone National Forest. While enjoying the splendor of the historic lodge, guests were treated to the history of the original hunting trip, as well as stories about Prince Albert I and Buffalo Bill Cody.

"Pacific Southwest Region, U.S. Forest Service in  Forestry  Jul 25,  Bob Goodwin, a former California Highway Patrol officer, now works for the U.S. Forest Service as a Tribal relations advisor. (U.S. Forest Service photo) During his 21 years as a California Highway Patrol officer, Bob Goodwin eased tensions during traffic accidents, issued verbal warnings and made arrests—all in a calm and cool way. Now, as Tribal relations advisor for the U.S. Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Region, Goodwin is again relying on those valuable people and negotiating skills to build relations between Tribal entities and the federal government. Goodwin’s easy-going demeanor, “can do” attitude, and ability to resolve challenging issues make him perfect for the job. As tribal relations advisor, Goodwin, 50, who grew up in Northern California, provides advice and guidance to the regional forester on issues that concern Native Americans. He also works with the region’s national forests and ranger districts on projects that may have an effect on traditional, cultural sites. Goodwin is often called upon to ensure smooth relations when the interests of tribal entities and the Forest Service conflict. He is currently working with the tribes as the Forest Service implements the Forest Plan Revision on the region’s Inyo, Sequoia and Sierra national forests. The Forest Plan instructs the Forest Service on how to manage the resources of a national forest. While the issues have been challenging, Goodwin views the exercise as an opportunity for the Forest Service to strengthen relationships with its tribal partners. “My experiences with the (California Highway Patrol) got me into situations that were very stressful or difficult, where I had to look at all the possibilities on how these things could be resolved,” said Goodwin. Along with his experience with the highway patrol, Goodwin, who is an enrolled member of the Karuk Tribe part Karuk, was elected to the Karuk Tribal Council and served two four-year terms. Despite his tribal connection and experience, he was uncertain about applying for the position with the Forest Service because he wondered whether he could serve the needs of both the agency and the Tribes. But after careful consideration, he determined that his unique experience brings an understanding that would be valuable for both parties. Goodwin says he is particularly interested in protecting natural resources and developing stewardship opportunities for all tribes across the state. “Bob has first-hand experience from the tribal side which gives him a leg up in the job,” said Leaf Hillman, director of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy for the Karuk Tribe.  “He handles tough situations calmly and doesn’t get rattled.”  Category/Topic:  Forestry  Tags:  California  Forestry  FS  Inyo National Forest  Native Americans  OTR  Sequoia National Forest  Sierra National Forest  Tribal","What unique experience and perspective does Bob Goodwin, as a former Highway Patrol officer and Karuk tribal member, bring to his role as Tribal relations advisor for the U.S. Forest Service?","* His background as a calm and effective mediator in stressful situations during his time with the Highway Patrol * His personal connection to the Karuk Tribe through his tribal membership and past service on the Karuk Tribal Council * A firsthand understanding of both the federal agency's perspective and the needs of Native American communities This blend of experiences allows him to navigate complex relationships between the Forest Service and tribal entities, making him well-suited for his role."

"USDA Forest Service Chief in  USDA Results  Forestry  Nov 22,  Untreated ponderosa pine woodland compared to an area restored by the Greater Flagstaff Forest Partnership working with the Forest Service in on the Coconino National Forest in Arizona. While people have squabbled over the direction of federal forest management, many landscapes have declined. Take southwestern ponderosa pine, for example. Where thick grasses once waved under big orange-barked pines, thickets of spindly trees now threaten natural and human communities alike through outbreaks of insects and disease, followed by devastating fires. Now people are joining together around common conservation goals to restore landscapes like these. The U.S. Forest Service is working with partners to restore healthy watersheds capable of delivering all the values and benefits that Americans want and need. The goal is to restore landscapes that future generations will describe with the same awe inspired in the first European visitors. In Arizona, environmentalists, local officials, and others have coalesced behind a Forest Service initiative to furnish small-diameter materials from four overgrown national forests to local mills and bioenergy facilities. “I’m hoping to look back on this day as the official end of the forest wars,” said Todd Schulke of the Center for Biological Diversity. The time is right for a restoration economy. The Forest Service is tailoring its programs and projects to a new management environment associated with climate change, demographic growth, and other large-scale drivers of landscape changes that are undermining the health of America’s forests and grasslands. Restoration treatments are based on collaboration with stakeholders to achieve mutual goals across entire landscapes, leading to more jobs and a better future for forest-based communities hard hit by recession. A restoration economy will take time to develop. It will take years to establish confidence and mutual goodwill, overcoming lingering doubts and festering fears and suspicions. In time, however, Americans can unite to achieve their mutual restoration goals through landscape-scale conservation. Joining together, we can link ecological restoration to jobs and economic opportunities for communities across the nation, for the sake of generations to come.

"National Program Leader with the Division of Youth and 4-H, National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Initiatives  Oct 19,  Since its creation more than 100 years ago, 4-H has expanded its focus from the field to the lab to keep pace with developments in agricultural techniques and technologies. Photo courtesy of 4-H. National 4-H Week happens each October, a time when nearly six million youth celebrate their participation in 4-H.  Every year, clubs around the country showcase the great things that 4-H offers young people and highlight the incredible things they do to make a positive impact in their communities. The 4-H clover is one of the most recognized in the country, but it wasn’t always that way.  Like most things, it grew – this case from three leaves. The seeds of 4-H were planted at the start of the 20th century by several adults in different states who were concerned about young people. Clark County, Ohio, claims credit as being the birthplace of 4-H, although the initial groups were called “The Tomato Club” or the “Corn Club.” The times were ripe for a new youth innovation like 4-H. During the late s, public universities’ researchers saw that adults in the farming communities did not readily accept the new agricultural discoveries being developed on campuses, such as hybrid seed corn, milk sanitation and home canning procedures. However, they found that young people were open to new thinking. Rural youth programs became an innovative way to introduce new agricultural technology to their communities. In , Iowa school superintendents Jessie Field Shambaugh and O.H. Benson developed a 3-leaf clover pin with an “H” on each leaf to signify “head,” “heart,” and “hands.” In a meeting, club leaders approved the design of a 4-leaf clover with an H on each leaf, adding “health.” By , the groups were becoming known as 4-H clubs. Congress passed the Smith-Lever Act in , creating the Cooperative Extension System at USDA, which included work of various boys' and girls' clubs involved with agriculture, home economics and related subjects. This action effectively nationalized the 4-H program. Between and , clubs were formed at some historically black land-grant colleges in Southern states opening up 4-H to more African-American youth. As 4-H grew, its focus moved beyond the translation of science to include personal growth so that youth could gain skills to help them transition to adulthood in a contributing, productive and self-directed manner. With its national headquarters located within USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), today 4-H serves nearly 6 million youth in rural, urban and suburban communities in every state and many U.S. military installations around the world. Today’s 4-H’ers tackle the nation's top issues, from global food security, climate change and sustainable energy to childhood obesity and food safety. To improve the nation's ability to compete in key scientific fields and take on the leading challenges of the 21st century, 4-H programs offer a wide variety of science, engineering, technology and applied math educational opportunities, including agricultural sciences, rocketry, robotics, environmental protection and computer science.

Photo by Carlos Harris There is no one-size-fits-all approach to career development and, according to one of the nation’s new leaders in agriculture, the course one steers toward a profession in agriculture can be as varied and diverse as the population itself. “I’m not a big fan of the term ‘pipeline’ because it implies that there is only one way in and only one direction you can go,” said Dr. Victoria LeBeaux, a national program leader (NPL) with USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA).  “If that were true I certainly wouldn’t be here, since I had no intention of studying agriculture.” As an undergraduate, she studied economics with the goal of working in international development. Prior to starting her doctorate in sustainable agriculture, LeBeaux lived in rural areas in France and Austria and volunteered in Mexico.  Iowa State University ultimately recruited her to complete doctoral training in a three-year NIFA-funded National Needs Fellowship (NNF) program. NNF trains students for masters and doctoral degrees. In some cases it also provides additional post-doctoral training for the Fellows.  For LeBeaux, that additional training meant a six-month stint in Guatemala where she examined how technical assistance providers helped enhance regional food security by advancing sustainable agriculture practices. LeBeaux returned to NIFA in after completing her Ph.D. and subsequent postdoctoral studies, and became an NPL in NIFA’s Division of Community and Education.  In that role she manages about $10 million in federal funding that supports secondary and postsecondary research, education and extension in the food, agricultural, and human sciences. These programs include the Educational Literacy Initiative’s Research and Extension for Undergraduates (REEU) fellowships program.  REEU provides experiential learning opportunities for underrepresented and first-generation college students. In addition, she uses her scientific training to represent NIFA in federal initiatives like USDA’s Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food, which helps coordinate USDA programs to strengthen local and regional food networks nationwide. “I sincerely appreciate the opportunities provided though the NNF program,” she said.  “As with many other young people, pursuing doctoral education was not on my radar and would not have been possible had I not had the financial support provided by the grant.  I think we need to create a diverse array of pathways to link young people to careers in agriculture and to show them that whatever they are interested in, there are opportunities in agriculture.” NIFA programs offer grants for K-12 schools and community colleges, such as The Secondary Education, Two-Year Postsecondary Education, and Agriculture in the K-12 Classroom Challenge Grants (SPECA) program; funding for undergraduate and masters level education such as the Higher Education Challenge Grants program and the Multicultural Scholars Program (MSP); and support for doctoral studies is provided by the NNF Fellowship and the Education and Literacy Initiative. NNF supports 45 new masters and doctoral students each year, while MSP supports 35 undergrads. Beyond grants, there are many other ways people can benefit from NIFA. For example, educators can access free curriculum from AITC through its Curriculum Matrix. NIFA is also the home of 4-H National Headquarters that supports the positive youth leadership development. NIFA is also a key partner with the Cooperative Extension Service, which operates offices across the country to provide community education in agriculture, health, nutrition, personal finances, and more. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"Smokey Bear Gives Bear Hugs in New Wildfire Prevention Campaign  Imagine dousing your campfire then getting a big bear hug from Smokey Bear, the iconic symbol of wildfire prevention for nearly 70 years. That’s the idea behind three videos in a new series of Smokey Bear public service advertisements released July 12, , designed to raise awareness about wildfire prevention. The Smokey Bear campaign is the longest running PSA campaign in U.S. History. The new ads will feature his well-known tagline, “Only YOU can prevent wildfires.” The new twist is the bear hugs.

"National Institute of Food and Agriculture in  Research and Science  Jun 11,  Youth learn about computers at a Air Force 4-H camp in New York. (Photo courtesy of 4-H) Military-connected youth have an exciting opportunity to join other members of the military family this summer. These residential and day camps will develop skills and teach the campers new techniques that will help prepare them to be productive citizens. The 16 camps, held in 15 states, are 4-H camps sponsored by Air Force Child and Youth Programs, with programs tailored to meet the needs of both the host unit and regional 4-H programs. Camp themes range from leadership development to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); from sustainable energy to college prep; from drones and geospatial technology to outdoor forestry and farm conservation; and more. In addition to camps sponsored by the Air Force, Purdue University’s Cooperative Extension Service hosts Military Teen Adventure Camps that are open to families in all service branches. Purdue’s program is funded by a grant from Department of Defense and USDA. USDA’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) is the home of 4-H National Headquarters and provides funding and national program leadership to 4-H. “Besides having a great time at summer camp, making new friends, and creating memories that will last a lifetime, youth who attend Air Force 4-H Camps develop a variety of life skills, experience independence, foster teamwork, enhance communication, and increase social skills while having fun with other military youth,” said David Brittain, North Carolina State University 4-H extension associate with the Air Force 4-H Partnership. The 4-H Military Partnerships Program provides support to military-connected youth whether they live on or near an installation, in the United States or overseas. Despite the frequent moves of military families, 4-H clubs provide consistency in belonging and the chance to develop life skills through a positive youth development framework. 4-H programs integrate the research-based programs and resources of the nation’s land-grant universities to help youth excel. NIFA invests in and advances agricultural research, education, and extension and seeks to make transformative discoveries that solve societal challenges.

"West Virginia: After the Flooding Neighbors Helping Neighbors Get the Food They Need  It was late July in Greenbrier County, W.Va., almost one month to the day since torrential rain and flooding struck most of the state.  In response to the disaster, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service approved the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) request to operate a Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP) in several of the most severely impacted counties, including Greenbrier.  At several of the D-SNAP application sites throughout the state, dozens of DHHR staff prepared for what they anticipated to be a busy week of conducting interviews, determining eligibility, and issuing D-SNAP benefits to residents who lost food, income and property due to the flooding.

"New SNAP E&T Initiatives Aim to Help SNAP Participants Find Jobs  Getting a good job these days takes more than good intentions because today’s jobs require a higher level of skills than ever before.  This is why the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s Employment and Training Program (SNAP E&T), administered by states across the country, has such an important role to play in helping SNAP recipients gain the skills they need to find and keep good jobs.  This is also why the U.S. Department of Agriculture is committed to supporting this effort. USDA demonstrated that commitment in two new initiatives launched just this week, the SNAP E&T Learning Academy and a new website for the innovative SNAP to Skills Project, led by the Food and Nutrition Service. The Academy breaks new ground, as a first-ever opportunity that will help address an identified need. You see, though SNAP E&T programs operate across America, we’ve found that there is an opportunity for further sharing of best practices and lessons learned by developing resources that spread the knowledge base throughout the country. The two new projects launched this week will use a “train-the-trainer” model to create new leadership capacity to build the next generation of SNAP E&T programs.

"NRCS Recovery Act Project Helps Provide New Starts for Residents   For more than 45 years, people who lived in West Virginia’s Dunloup Creek Watershed have dealt with floods. That’s because there’s a scarcity of flat land in the area and residents have had to settle mostly along the creek—the very area that floods during storms. Two major floods in and devastated five low-income communities spread out across two counties in the watershed. The floods destroyed houses, ate away at the stream bank, polluted drinking water and washed away utilities. Damages totaled millions of dollars. Because of the mountainous terrain and far-flung population, traditional flood control measures like dams, channels, floodwalls, dredging and flood proofing were not feasible. Yet many residents were trapped into living in their damaged homes, unable to move out because of perilous financial circumstances.
